   When it comes to representing
California, the banana slug just won't do, Gov. George Deukmejian
said in vetoing a bill that designated the slimy, slothful creature
the state's official mollusk.
   The veto by the image-conscious governor, announced Tuesday,
squashed the hopes of a group of Blue Birds and Camp Fire girls
from the San Francisco Bay area who led the campaign to make the
banana slug a state mascot.
   ``I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' says Grace Moses, 9,
whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks lobbying. ``I mean, why did
he have to do that? He didn't know anything about it. I hope he
watched the news about it.''
   Deukmejian said he vetoed the bill because the large, brilliant
yellow mollusk, which can eat poison oak without getting a rash,
isn't a true Californian.
   ``If there is a need to designate a state mollusk, it would be
more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to California and
perhaps one that is more representative of the international
reputation that California enjoys,'' he said in his veto message.
   The governor added that the dubious honor of being the banana
slug's home state may belong to wetter neighbors to the north,
since the species was first identified near the mouth of the
Columbia River in Oregon and lives as far north as Alaska.
   But members of the Redwood City Dynamite Blue Birds and the
office of the legislator who carried their slug bill said the
governor is misinformed about the banana slug, which has the
scientific name Ariolimax columbianus and lives in damp coastal
forest areas throughout the Pacific Northwest.
   Janice Hopcraft, an aide to Democratic Assemblyman Bryon Sher,
said four of five kinds of banana slugs are native to California.
   ``I think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap,'' said
Hopcraft, who wore a yellow armband Tuesday in memory of Sher's
bill. ``They're obviously easy to look down upon and they do have
some odd habits. Perhaps, the governor looked too much at that and
not their good side.
   ``As far as its representative qualities, it's absolutely a
unique example of the diversity of California's wildlife.''
   Deukmejian, a Republican who's made a personal campaign of
promoting California trade nationally and overseas, suggested the
Golden State may not need an official slug at all.
   And if California must have a mollusk, he'd prefer the pismo
clam, black abalone, red abalone, turban shell, two-spotted
octupus, common squid or another breed of mussel unique to the
state.
   California has several official mascots, including a tree, a
fossil, a reptile, a fish, a rock and even a state insect in
addition to the usual bird, animal and flower. The Legislature sent
a bill to the governor Monday that would designate the square dance
as the official folk dance, and the West Coast swing, or jitterbug,
as the official dance.
   Deukmejian has not acted on that measure.
   The banana slug gained notoriety a few years ago when students
at the University of California, Santa Cruz chose it as the
official school mascot over the sea lion, despite the objections of
the university's president.

   Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday
vetoed a bill to make the banana slug the state mollusk, leaving a
troop of Blue Birds singing the blues.
   Deukmejian explained in his veto message that the slug isn't
Californian enough and that its reputation just doesn't fit with
California's image.
   But members of the Redwood City Blue Birds say the governor's
grasp of mollusk lore is a bit slippery.
   Deukmejian said the species was first identified in Oregon and
ranges as far north as Alaska, so it's not a true-blue Californian.
   Besides, the yellowish mollusk has an image that isn't befitting
the Golden State, he said. He suggested that native California
fauna such as the pismo clam, the black abalone, the red abalone or
the turban shell would make a better choice.
   ``If there is a need to designate a state mollusk, it would be
more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to California and
perhaps one that is more representative of the international
reputation that California enjoys,'' Deukmejian said.
   The Blue Birds who sponsored the campaign and the bill's author
said the governor was all wet.
   Four of five types of banana slug are native to California, said
Janice Hopcraft, an aide to Assemblyman Bryon Sher. Hopcraft and
her co-workers wore yellow armbands Tuesday to mark the bill's
demise.
   ``I think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap,'' she
said. ``They're obviously easy to look down upon, and they do have
some odd habits. Perhaps the governor looked too much at that and
not their good side.
   ``As far as its representative qualities, it's absolutely a
unique example of the diversity of California's wildlife.''
   ``Yeah, he didn't know all the facts,'' said 9-year-old Susanna
Farley, whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks on the bill.
   ``I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' said her friend, Grace
Moses, also 9. ``I mean, why did he have to do that? He didn't know
anything about it. I hope he watched the news about it.''
   Hopcraft said the veto is a disappointing end for the bill's
young supporters.
   ``I think this is basically the ultimate lesson for the Dynamite
Blue Birds and Camp Fire kids, that not all things have a happy
ending.''
   Gubernatorial vetoes can be overturned by two-thirds majorities
in the Assembly and Senate, but Assembly Republicans have vowed to
block any attempts to override Deukmejian's vetoes.

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   An editorial writer for the Santa Barbara (Calif.) 
News-Press expressed sadness recently that Rose Bird found it necessary to spruce herself up with a visit to the hairdresser just before last November's elections. 
We had a little trouble getting the point at first. 
Why shouldn't the former California chief justice, a handsome woman, have a new hairdo? 
So we read on. 

   As most everyone knows by now, Ms. Bird was ousted from the California Supreme Court by the state's voters, new hairdo notwithstanding. 
Two other justices identified with her views were thrown out as well. 
Three new justices appointed by Gov. Deukmejian and vetted by a three-member judicial commission were installed last month. 

   The editorial complaint about Ms. Bird having to fix her hair just to try to make a good impression on the voters was by way of leading up to a proposed amendment to the California Constitution. 
A Santa Barbara politician named Gary Hart -- not the Gary Hart, but certainly a Democrat and a California state senator -- is offering the amendment. 
It would change California's system of selecting and, more importantly, disposing of Supreme Court justices, a system that dates back to a 1934 initiative. 

   The fundamental change would be interesting. 
Currently justices are appointed by the governor, vetted by the Commission on Judicial Appointments and put on the ballot for public approval or disapproval at the next general election. 
They serve 12-year terms, after which they go before the voters again. 
Ms. Bird and her two colleagues were the first justices ever voted out of office. 
Voters had become fed up with their predisposition toward leniency for violent criminals, among other things. 

   Sen. Hart would take the voters out of the picture. 
Justices would be appointed by the governor, confirmed by the state Senate and be limited to a single 12-year term. 
No justice would have to fix her, or his, hair to try to win reconfirmation. 
The Hart argument is that this would make appointments less "political." 

   We've noticed how apolitical Sen. Joe Biden and other Democrats in the U.S. Senate have been when it comes time to confirm President Reagan's judicial appointees. 
Sen. Hart presumably intends that the Democrats who dominate the California state Senate will be less partisan, but we are not much encouraged by the highly charged testimony presented by the National Organization for Women and other liberal groups when Gov. Deukmejian's latest appointees were up before the judicial commission. 
NOW thought appointee Marcus Kaufman "hostile" toward anti-discrimination laws. 

   In Sen. Hart's view the current system is too political because the voters, rather than professional politicians, do the confirming. 
What do voters know about such matters, the Santa Barbara News-Press wants to know. 
Well, the voters apparently knew they didn't like Rose Bird. 
We suspect that is what really grates in Santa Barbara. 
The voters threw out Rose Bird. 
So Sen. Hart and the News-Press want to throw out the voters. 

   The governor has a thought or two on this subject. 
In a recent interview he observed that in 1934 the people of California reserved for themselves the confirmation right. 
"I don't see any reason to change that and I would not favor taking away from the people the right to make that decision." 

   We rather like the idea of popular democracy ourselves.

   At the Pike's Landing bar, the regulars
have a curious way of telling spring is near _ they wait for the
first truck or car to break through the ice of the Chena River.
   Gary Halmstad earned that dubious distinction Monday. His 1979
van broke through 8 inches of ice as he started across an ice
bridge used as a winter shortcut by many residents.
   ``I hate being this kind of harbinger of spring,'' he said.
   The ice cracked between the front and back tires, and he
summoned a small wrecker to pull him off. Instead, the tow truck
pulled the front tires off a supporting shelf of ice, and the front
of the van plunged into about 5 feet of water. He planned to call a
larger wrecker to pull the van out the rest of the way.
   ``I'm glad it wasn't in the middle,'' he said. ``I suppose I
should giggle. All I have to do is pay money for a tow truck and
drain the engine.''
   The dunking was the earliest that bar patrons could recall.

   Several California lawmakers are
trying not to be spineless as they defend their decision to make
the banana slug the official state mollusk.
   The state Governmental Orginization Committee on Tuesday endured
slimy jabs about the slug, including comparisons to its garlicky
cousin, escargot, before sliding the bill out of committee on a
12-2 vote.
   The legislation, authored by democratic Assemblyman Byron Sher,
now inches onto the Assembly floor.
   Sher introduced the bill at the urging of the Dynamite Blue Bird
troop of Redwood City. Six members of the inveterate invertebrate
supporters testified before the committee and brought along six
banana slugs.
   The state has several official mascots, such as the California
gray whale as the marine mammal and the California dog-faced
butterful as the state insect. But it has no mollusk, which is a
large phylum of invertebrate animals that includes octopi, abalone,
mussels, snails and slugs.
   Blue Bird Susanna Farley said the banana slug should be the
state mollusk because ``they're native to the West Coast and live
in redwood forests, which is the state tree, and also they eat
poison oak and that's very helpful.''
   ``Can we make escargot out of them?'' inquired Assemblyman
Curtis Tucker.
   ``I have no inherent objection to the state mollusk being such a
useful, slimy, oozy thing,'' said Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle.
   Assemblyman Trice Harvey tried unsuccessfully to make the state
mollusk the abalone, saying they taste better and are not ``yucky
yellow creatures that hide out in the mountains.''

IT'S THE LEAST THEY COULD DO FOR THE TERNS, NAVY FIGURES

Jets roar to a takeoff and scream over the Oakland Bay Bridge, making the 
Alameda Naval Air Station runway seem one of the most unlikely places for a 
nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
But each summer the air station is transformed into a sort of maximum-security 
bird sanctuary when nesting pairs of California least terns begin to breed in a 
fenced-in some 75 yards from a runway flanked by land-based cannons and armed 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
The California least tern, an endangered species more commonly found in the 
southern part of the state, has no other fertile nesting grounds in Northern 
California. About 100 nesting pairs -- a local record, up from 72 in 1989 -- 
are breeding at the base this year, making the military installation home to 
more than 90% of the least tern population in the north. 
</P>
<P>
"It is critical to keeping them breeding in Northern California," said Laura 
Collins, caretaker at the four-acre Alameda breeding area. "We really don't 
have any big success stories anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The California least tern has bounced back fairly well since the bird -- a 
cousin to the sea gull, about nine inches from tail to bill -- was included 20 
years ago on the first federal list of endangered species. From a low of about 
300 breeding pairs 30 years ago, the least tern population had increased to 
1,250 pairs by 1989, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of open spaces and fenced-off beaches on military bases, more 
than half of the least tern population heads to one of the installations at 
breeding time, said Barbara Massey, an ornithologist who studies a least tern 
breeding colony program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the state's least terns nest on beaches in Southern California -- about 
350 pairs at Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, another 250 pairs at Venice Beach, 
and about 250 more at Bolsa Chica State Park in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the Alameda Naval Air Station least terns are not the only ones with a 
penchant for airports. Although the birds naturally seek beach nesting spots, 
they have been known to look elsewhere. About 10 pairs of the birds make their 
nests at the Metropolitan Oakland International Airport, and another small 
group nests between two runways at a San Diego airfield, Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
The sharing of Tarmac and airspace by 200 birds and two reserve squadrons of 
attack jet aircraft -- not to mention four squadrons of helicopters and other 
military planes -- requires some adjustments. For example, Collins sets a 
period in late summer when the Navy shuts down its 3,000-foot main runway and 
directs traffic to another airstrip at the base. 
</P>
<P>
During this period, a Navy spokesman said, fledglings' first short flights 
often land them in the middle of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"At a certain time during the growing process . . . these least terns have a 
tendency to run out on the runways, and they try to hide on the white and 
yellow paint strips," said Bill Valente, the base's assistant public affairs 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has taken other steps to protect the birds. Navy builders surrounded 
the breeding area with an electrified fence, capable of jolting predators with 
a harmless but discouraging shock from six-volt batteries. This year, the base 
hired federal animal control workers to come in and catch cats and rival birds 
that threaten the least terns and their eggs, Navy spokesman David Kashimba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For breeding birds, the problems associated with airstrip nesting don't end 
there. At especially noisy times -- when jet pilots practice touch-and-go 
landings, for example -- the birds sometimes do fly away. But they keep coming 
back. Theoretically, steady high noise levels could pose problems for the 
birds, which bring food only to chicks that recognize and return their call. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they manage to teach their chicks their calls when there's 
the roar of jets everywhere all the time," Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
But the birds manage so well that some of the people who help protect them say 
the air station colony could anchor a Northern California comeback that could 
eventually link up with the southern colonies and spread the birds throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The least tern is one of the success stories, in terms of managing endangered 
species," Collins said.

   California Rejects Bid for Protection

   California state officials' rejection of recommendations
that they grant protection to a small songbird sets up
another bitter court fight over the fate of a troubled
species.
   Late Thursday, the California Fish and Game Commission
declined to grant the California coastal gnatcatcher
protection under the Endangered Species Act.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission, which consists of four members appointed
by the state's governor, rejected the recommendation of the
California Fish and Game Department, which after a year of
review of the gnatcatcher's condition had strongly
recommended listing the bird as endangered in order to avert
its possible extinction. The commission has rarely gone
against state biologists' findings on a species in the past,
but the panel, by a vote of 3 to 1, held that it wasn't
convinced that the bird's condition is dire enough to warrant
protections.
   Environmentalists, led by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, attacked the commission's decision and vowed to
challenge it in court as early as this week.
   Federal officials are also considering whether to grant
the gnatcatcher protection under the federal Endangered
Species Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's California
field scientists have recommended that it be listed as
endangered under the act. The federal agency's decision on
the bird is due later this month.
   The gnatcatcher dispute is shaping up as an important test
case in the increasingly bitter clash over how far to go to
protect wildlife. The gnatcatcher lives in the low scrub that
dots the southern California coast; much of its habitat has
been plowed under to make way for housing tracts in
fast-growing counties such as Orange, Riverside and Los
Angeles. State and federal scientists believe there are only
about 2,000 pairs of gnatcatchers left in the U.S.
   Thousands of acres of the remaining coastal scrub are
owned by big developers, such as Irvine Cos., Baldwin Co. and
Santa Margarita Co. The companies, which are among the
biggest Republican campaign contributors in the nation, have
spent millions of dollars on a lobbying blitz aimed at
blocking any listing of the bird as endangered under either
state or federal wildlife laws. The developers contend that
they're already voluntarily setting aside enough gnatcatcher
habitat to ensure the bird's survival, and that listing it as
endangered would paralyze housing construction and road
projects, costing billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.
   The commission in early August had delayed its decision on
the gnatcatcher, after developers produced a new study they
maintained refuted scientific findings that the gnatcatcher
was headed for extinction. But at Thursday's commission
meeting in Long Beach, Calif., Pete Bonadelli, head of the
state Fish and Game Department, reported that the new
information in some ways only strengthened his agency's
belief that the gnatcatcher is imperiled and should be listed
under the state's endangered species statute. As is often the
case with California environmental laws, the state's
endangered species statutes are in some respects tougher than
federal laws.
   The commission still voted against listing the
gnatcatcher. One reason may have been a last-minute appeal
from Michael Mantell, deputy director of the state's
Department of Resources, which is trying to persuade
developers to cooperate voluntarily with its own plan for
preserving coastal habitat. Many environmentalists support
the Department of Resources plan, but they contend the plan
is many months, if not years, away from bearing fruit and say
the gnatcatcher can't wait that long.
   Environmentalists accused the state commission of caving
in to political pressure on the gnatcatcher. "The
commission's position is absurd," said Joel Reynolds, a
senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"They clearly have allowed politics to supplant science." Mr.
Reynolds said the NRDC will file a suit in state court
alleging that the commission's action violates state law,
perhaps as early as this week.

   Around the country, Dukakis field leaders and Democratic Party
state and local leaders contend the appearance of flagging momentum

_ a part of the ups and downs of a campaign that will balance in
the end.

   Richard Nixon's former top aide says the 37th
president not only was reluctant to install an extensive taping
system in the White House, but that he quickly lost awareness that
his every conversation was being recorded.
   ``The historiography of the Nixon administration will eventually
be much the richer as a result of Richard Nixon's decision to
tape-record his meetings and telephone conversations,'' writes H.R.
Haldeman, Nixon's onetime chief of staff. ``Nixon was not thinking
of historians when he made this decision, but they will be the
ultimate beneficiaries.''
   Haldeman discusses the origin of the taping system, which
provided the evidence that eventually drove Nixon from office in
the Watergate scandal, in the summer issue of Prologue, the
quarterly publication of the National Archives.

   Drawn by adventure and hopes of big
profits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting
ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.
   More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to
apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt,
designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened
by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million.
   Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and
streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as
much as $1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat.
   But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know
what they're in for.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old Dale Dunaway, who
operates one of Florida's few alligator processing plants.

   Rivals in the fight against computer ``viruses''
are spending much of their time battling each other instead of
their common enemy: the software invaders that can secretly destroy
computer data.
   The dispute concerns which of two groups has the qualifications
and impartiality to evaluate anti-virus software for customers. The
competition could slow progress in combating the viruses.
   ``I personally know most of the people in this industry and I
have never seen this kind of animosity,'' Brian Camenker, head of
the PC users group of the Boston Computer Society, said Tuesday.
   The battle centers on products _ called ``vaccines'' _ that are
designed to combat viruses. Viruses are tiny pieces of computer
code that pranksters or others slip into normal programs to
``infect'' computers when used.

   Israel's shutdown of Arab labor federations
with 80,000 workers and an association of 108 charities is
disrupting institutions that Palestinians hope will form the basis
of a future state.
   Palestinians charge that destroying grassroots organizations is
the whole object of Israel's move, coming after the outlawing of
the so-called popular committees that have guided the 8-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   ``They want them closed so when a Palestinian state comes, it
will find no infrastructure,'' said Walid Asali, head of the
Palestinian Lawyers Association, one of seven professional groups
shut by the Israelis.
   Israeli authorities accuse the organizations involved of being
fronts for Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. They
claim the groups distribute funds, recruit members or organize
protests against Israeli rule.

Raising babies can be stressful. Consider the adult Western gull. When chicks 
want to eat they peck at a red mark on one of their parents' bills until mom or 
dad regurgitates a meal.

"It is kind of fun to go out to Anacapa Island and watch them do that," said 
Jean Van Tatenhove, a ranger for Channel Islands National Park. "It's a little 
gross, but it's fun too."

For the adult Xantus Murrelet, chick-rearing includes forcing the young birds 
to tumble down cliffs on Santa Barbara Island for a life at sea two days after 
they hatch.

Calling sea birds the last frontier for bird watchers, Van Tatenhove, an 
ornithologist, told the stories of some of the area's lesser known sea birds at 
park headquarters at Ventura Harbor on Sunday. Each month the National Park 
Service features free lectures on park wildlife. Talks on sea birds will 
continue through December. In January, rangers will begin discussions on whales 
to mark the mammals' migration through the Santa Barbara Channel.

<HEAD>Andean Condor Dies En Route to Experiment for California Condor

   One zoo-hatched Andean condor died in transit
to a wilderness area but three others survived for an experiment
intended to show the best way to reintroduce endangered California
condors into the wild.
   The surviving birds were safely placed in secret holding pens
Saturday in Los Padres National Forest, and more Andean condors
will be taken to the area in October, said Joe Dowhan, condor
recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The dead bird was sent to San Diego for an autopsy, Dowhan said.
   He said its death will have little effect on the program. ``In
some ways, you kind of want things to go wrong now instead of
later,'' he said.
   The South American birds, all females to prevent breeding in the
wild, are being used to test techniques biologists hope to use to
begin returning the California condor to the wild after their
numbers are increased in a captive breeding program.
   Only 28 California condors are known to survive, all in
captivity at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The Andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is
the closest living relative to the California condor. Though the
Andean condors are also endangered, they number in the thousands.
   Scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds
hatched in captivity adapt to freedom and fend for themselves
without native birds of their species to serve as examples.
   The 3- and 4-month-old birds will spend several weeks in mesh
enclosures in the forest 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   When the Andean birds are able to fly, around November,
scientist will fit them with radio transmitters, release them and
monitor their progress.
   The Andean birds will remain in the wild until it's time to
release California condors, perhaps as early as 1992 if the captive
breeding program continues to succeed, Dowhan said.

<TEXT>     It's a big bird. Along with its Andean cousin, the California condor is the
largest soaring bird in North America, with a nine-foot wing span and a weight
up to 22 pounds. The condor is black, with white highlights on the wings, a
bald yellow head and a red neck.;    Landed, it's a bit of a klutz. In the
air, the condor can cruise for hours, checking out the coastal range for newly
dead meat. Basically, this is a recovering vulture.;    Coastal Indians saw
the high-flying condor as a symbol of freedom, and believed that the end for
the condor would mean the end of the world as we know it, and a time of
purification.;    That time almost came. Condors grew sick from pesticides,
poisoned coyote bait and lead-filled corpses left by hunters. Some were run
down by cars while snacking on road kill. Others flew into power lines. The
spread of humans destroyed much of the big birds' habitat -- they hang in the
San Rafael Mountains near Santa Barbara. The California condor became the most
endangered avian in the world.;    Unfortunately, the condors are avid
practitioners of planned parenthood. In the wild, they wait to mate till the
relatively (for a bird) mature age of five or six, and lay only one egg every
other year.;    It looked like a bird that's been around since prehistoric
times wouldn't survive the 20th century.;    But as the condor became a symbol
of environmental destruction, it developed "great political clout," says Bill
Toone, curator of birds at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. "The condor is a
useless piece of trash in a lot of ways. You have this creature that's nothing
more than a vulture who vomits, burps and eats dead things, and you've turned
it into something incredible.";    The threat to the condor set off a fierce
debate among environmentalists. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began
putting radio transmitters on condors and then moved on to egg-napping, hoping
to improve the fledglings' survival rate by raising them in captivity on
minced mouse. The Audubon Society argued the interference was necessary; the
Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth believed it was better to let the condor
live and die out in the wild.;    David Brower, founder of Friends of the
Earth, wrote: "What if the (condor), watching Los Angeles sprawl toward its
last hills, has simply decided it is time to go? Perhaps feeding on ground
squirrels, for a bird that once fed on mastodons, is too steep a fall from
glory?";    Finally, in 1987, researchers grabbed the last wild condors --
only 27 were left -- and started breeding them at the San Diego and Los
Angeles zoos. Thirteen condors have joined the flock.;    Despite the breeding
success, the California condor is still tops on the endangered list; survival
will be assured when several 100-bird flocks are flying in the wild, with
another flock breeding in captivity.;    Researchers hope the condors of the
future will soar over the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, 53,000 acres in the Los
Padres National Forest, plus condor country in New Mexico's Animas Mountains
purchased by the Nature Conservancy, and possibly the Grand Canyon as well.;  
 The first step will be taken in late 1991: Scientists plan to let three young
zoo-born birds fly wild in the Los Padres habitat.;    Condors who have
cruised California for 2.5 million years will be around for the 21st century
as well.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Stress Blamed On Rare Bird's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNN ELBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stress is believed to have killed a zoo-hatched
Andean condor that was on its way to freedom in an experiment to
see how its endangered North American cousin will adapt to the wild.
   Three other transplanted Andean condors in the program were
doing well Monday, officials said.
   The Andean birds were chosen for the experiment because it is
the closest living relative to the California condor. Though the
Andean species is also endangered, they number in the thousands.
Only 28 of its North American cousins exist and all in captivity.
   The Andean condors, which are also endangered, were transported
to Los Padres National Forest in airline-style animal shipping
crates and placed in secret holding pens Saturday.
   One died while being transported.
   Preliminary results of an autopsy show the death was
stress-related, although infection has not been ruled out, said Joe
Dowhan, condor recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Final test results are expected by Wednesday.
   He said it was premature to say how officials might have handled
the move differently or what changes might be implemented to
prevent other deaths.
   ``This is a learning process. Right now there are all kinds of
scenarios we could consider changing,'' he said.
   Scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds
hatched in captivity adapt to freedom, fending for themselves in a
region without native birds of their species to serve as examples.
   The first group of the 3- and 4-month-old birds are scheduled to
spend several weeks in mesh enclosures in the forest 75 miles
northeast of Los Angeles.
   Two came from the San Diego Wild Animal Park; one was from the
Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent, Md.; and the one that
died came from the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Scientists will prepare the birds for their first flights over
the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large
population of California condors.
   The condors are being exposed to other young condors for the
first time because they were raised singly, as in the wild, Dowhan
said.
   More Andean condors will be brought to the area in October.
   In December, when the birds should be able to fly, scientists
will fit them with radio monitors, release them, and follow their
progress.
   The Andean birds will remain in the wild until it's time to
release California condors, perhaps as early as 1992 if officials
have continued success in captive breeding programs at the Wild
Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo, Dowhan said.
   Blood tests on the first California condor conceived in
captivity determined the bird is a female, officials said Monday.
   The 4-month-old bird, named Molloko, also was determined to be
``in perfect health,'' said Tom Hanscom, spokesman at the Wild
Animal Park. The bird, which weighed in at 6} ounces when born
April 29, now weighs 16 pounds.
   Fourteen of the 27 other California condors are females. Park
officials say further tests will determine which of the birds are
related and how they will be separated for breeding.

<HEADLINE>  OFFICIAL STATE ARTIFACT? MEET THE STONE BEAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Now comes the revelation that we have no official state prehistoric
artifact. SB 404 by Sen. Ralph Dills, D-Gardena, would close that gap. Make
way for the chipped stone bear.;    Dills' arguments are simple: Stones
chipped to look like bears go far, far back in California's history. It would
be a tribute to the artistic contributions of American Indians. And the bear
is pretty darn prominent on California's official list. The grizzly bear,
after all, is the official animal.;    The artifact movement, if it can be
called that, started in 1985 when Cypress College students discovered an
8,000-year-old bear-shaped carving in San Diego County. A committee was
formed. Eventually a pitch was made. The 1985 find, which is about 2 1/2
inches long, would serve as the model for the official artifact under the
plan.;    But reasonable or not, don't expect this to be simple. This, after
all, has to pass the California Legislature.;    Remember, if you will, the
historic battle in 1988 over an official state mollusk. The proposal, muscled
along by the ultra-cute lobbying of a troop of Redwood City Camp Fire kids,
was to give that prestigious honor to the banana slug.;    The banana slug
eventually won in the Legislature but was vetoed by then-Gov. George
Deukmejian, who apparently was in a less humorous mood than lawmakers. The
banana slug, he said, is "not representative of the international reputation
that California enjoys." To the Camp Fire kids, that translated into
"harrumph.";    That might be a bad sign for Dills. He has the backing of
college students and scientists, hardly as adorable a group as the pack of
fourth-graders carrying around their pet slugs.  </TEXT>

   Four Andean condors that will serve as scouts
for reintroduction of the gravely threatened California condor into
the wild are headed for temporary pens in a rugged mountain range.
   The 3- and 4-month-old avian pioneers, hatched and reared in
zoos, will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures as scientists
prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and
foothills that once supported a thriving population of California
condors.
   The California species _ a black, vulture-like carrion eater
with a wingspan up to 9{ feet _ has dwindled to a mere 28, all in
captivity.
   Two Andean condors from the San Diego Wild Animal Park were
loaded into airline-style animal shipping crates Friday evening for
a 200-mile trip to the secret holding pens in the Los Padres
National Forest, 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles, Tom Hanscom, a
spokesman for the animal park, said in a telephone interview Friday.
   ``They want to arrive and put the birds in their new home in the
dark of night so the birds awaken the next morning thinking they
are in the same place they were before,'' Hanscom said as his crew
was ready to depart at 6:45 p.m. for the six-hour drive.
   The birds were not drugged, but were captured and wrapped in
blankets by familiar handlers, he said.
   ``By moving them in the dark it basically minimizes the
stress,'' Hanscom said.
   A third Andean condor hatched at the Los Angeles Zoo will join
the contingent, along with a fourth, flown in from a U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service center in Patuxent, Md., said Michael Wallace, the
Los Angeles Zoo biologist overseeing the program.
   The Andean birds, all females to prevent breeding in the wild,
will be used to test techniques biologists hope to use _ perhaps as
soon as 1992 _ to begin returning the California condor to nature.
More Andean condors will be added to the test flock later.
   In a $440,000 program overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the birds will be taken to a special mesh enclosure,
measuring about 20 feet by 40 feet and 15 feet high, in rugged
territory. The exact spot is secret to deter the curious or the
malicious.
   About November, when the birds are able to fly, they will be
fitted with radio monitoring gear and released. It's expected they
will cover much of the California condor's five-county range, a
land of bare grassy hills dotted with occasional oaks, and rugged,
rocky cliffs and canyons in the mountains that ring the southern
end of the San Joaquin Valley.
   The purpose of the test, Hanscom said, is twofold: To see how
birds hatched in captivity adapt to freedom; and to see if such
birds can learn to fend for themselves in a region without native
birds of their species to serve as examples.
   The program also will help scientists spot such possible hazards
as poison bait illegally left for coyotes or lead shot in animal
carcasses left by hunters, Hanscom said.
   The Andean birds will be captured from the wild when it's time
to release their California cousins, Hanscom said. The first
California birds could be released as early as 1992 if breeding
programs are successful, he said.
   The Andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is
the closest living relative to the California condor. Though the
Andean species is endangered, they number in the thousands.
   The California condor, North America's largest land bird, once
roamed widely along the West Coast, but its numbers had shrunk to
40 when the Fish and Wildlife Service launched a rescue effort in
1976.

<HEAD>Only Condor Chick Conceived In Captivity Eats First Meals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hungry bundle of fluff named Molloko, the
only California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled minced
mice Saturday, and keepers of the endangered species were
encouraged by its appetite.
   The newly hatched chick, which raised the condor population to
28, ate its first meal from the fingertips of a handler at 6 a.m.
and ate again at hourly intervals, said Martha Baker, spokeswoman
for the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   ``The chick was hungry and ate everything it was offered,'' Ms.
Baker said. ``Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the
chick. But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or
animal.''
   The chick's diet was a combination of minced baby mice and
chicken egg yolk, she said. The meals fed to the chick, which is
slightly larger than a person's fist, amounted to about two
tablespoons of food each time.
   U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel congratulated the Wild
Animal Park staff for the successful hatching.
   ``The hatching of the world's first captive-bred condor is a
milestone that we've been awaiting for years,'' Hodel said in a
statement released in Washington. The Interior Department's U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for the California condor
recovery program.
   ``This small chick represents a big step back from the brink of
extinction and a big step forward for recovery of the California
condor,'' he said.
   Keepers delicately wielding tweezers helped the chick break free
of its avocado-size egg at 5:38 p.m. Friday, ending a 61{-hour
hatching process that began when the chick first pecked cracks in
the shell Wednesday.
   The laborious process of helping the bird get free, led by
biologist Cyndi Keuhler, took nearly eight hours.
   Molloko is an Indian word for the giant condor species. The name
originates from the Sacramento Valley Maidu tribe and was chosen by
a council of California tribes last week, Ms. Baker said.
   After hatching, the chick was swaddled in a towel and put in the
same type of incubator used for premature infants. The chick
weighed about 6{ ounces.
   Its sex won't be determined for about a month because it must be
strong enough for a blood sample to be drawn.
   The chick will be reared by keepers using a hand puppet that
resembles an adult condor. The puppet is used to feed the chick and
help it identify with its species.
   The chick hatched from an egg laid March 3 by the only pair of
California condors known to be actively breeding. The egg was taken
from the parent birds and placed in the incubator in hope that the
parents would produce a second egg. That has not happened so far.
   All 28 California condors known to exist are in captivity: 15 at
the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo. Fourteen birds
are female.
   The captive flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in
the wild over the past five years. Molloko was the first addition
since April 1986, when a chick named Nojoqui was hatched at the
park from an egg laid in the wild.
   Efforts to save the California condor, which has a wingspan of
up to 10 feet at maturity, rest with the captive breeding program.
The last known wild California condor was captured a year ago.
   The goal of the program is to rebuild the population until
condors can be sent back into the wild. The earliest anticipated
release would be 1992, authorities have said. The oldest bird
hatched in captivity is 5 years old. Condors reach sexual maturity
at about age 7.

Banner Year -- The numbers are coming in on the recently concluded breeding 
season for the endangered California least tern, and 1990 shaped up as a banner 
season at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. Last season, 115 pairs of least 
terns nested there; this year, 239 total nests were counted. 
</P>
<P>
Because some birds build more than one nest for various reasons, the number of 
breeding pairs this season was probably slightly less than 239. But the most 
important number is how many successful fledglings were produced: 150, compared 
to last year's 45. 
</P>
<P>
The news on the small, gull-like bird was mixed at the Huntington State Beach 
colony. Last year, 70 pairs nested there, a number that dropped to 40 pairs 
this season. The good news is that 20 fledglings were produced, up from a 
disastrous five last season. The chicks at Huntington continued to fall prey to 
kestrels, while no predation problems were noted at Bolsa Chica this season. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated numbers for least terns at Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve 
remained relatively steady, between 60 and 70 pairs compared to last year's 74. 
About 50 fledglings are likely, according to state Fish and Game biologist 
Esther Burkett. She has not received numbers for the colony at Seal Beach 
National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I would say that we had a really, really good year," Burkett said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first season that all the least terns nested on Bolsa Chica's south 
island, having been pushed off the reserve's north island by the continuing 
success of larger tern species that have moved northward in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
At Bolsa Chica this season, counts estimate 1,000 elegant tern nests, 100 
Caspian tern nests and 100 Forster's tern nests. Black skimmers are at 295 
nests, up from 170 last year, and their breeding season continues. The breeding 
success of the skimmers comes despite the fact that many received some oil 
damage in the Feb. 7 American Trader spill off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
We're With the Band -- The state Fish and Game department is continuing to band 
many of the tern chicks that fledge at Bolsa Chica, particularly elegant tern 
and black skimmers. Chicks hatched this season have pink bands; 1989 birds have 
blue bands and 1988 birds have yellow bands. 
</P>
<P>
If you spot birds with these bands, you can help biologists by noting the date 
and location of the sighting, the number of birds with bands, the color of the 
bands and the species. Call Esther Burkett with the information: (714) 
537-0696. 
</P>
<P>
Museum News -- The Museum of Natural History and Science, which recently closed 
its doors in Newport Beach, has announced a Nov. 17 opening date for its new 
interim site in Aliso Viejo. Exhibits planned for the new facility include 
space exploration, robotic dinosaur models, local Indian artifacts and local 
marine mammal fossils.

   The hatchings of two healthy California
condors late last week and the possibility of eight to 10 chicks in
all this breeding season could accelerate the program to return the
endangered species to the wild, a zoo official said.
   A 5.8-ounce bird named Kareya, from the Karok Indian word
meaning ``creator of all things,'' emerged at 4:30 a.m. Friday, the
first of the vulturelike chicks to hatch at the Los Angeles Zoo,
said spokeswoman Cindy Richardson. Its gender won't be known for
about three months.
   Kareya's hatching came only a little more than 24 hours after
the second chick of the 1990 breeding season, Honsi, was hatched
early Thursday at the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   It was less than two years ago that the first California condor
chick was hatched after being bred in captivity. A chick named
Molloko was hatched at San Diego on April 29, 1988, amid national
fanfare.
   The latest hatchings nudged the total population of the species
to 35, all in the two zoos. There were only 27 known California
condors when all were taken into captivity for breeding in 1987.
   Scientists are trying to breed enough of the birds, which can
have a wingspan of nearly 10 feet, to begin returning some to their
natural habitat.
   Wildlife officials had planned on releasing the first of the
condors sometime between 1993 and 1995. But Michael Wallace,
curator for birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, said the captive breeding
program has achieved such success that the first birds could be
released in the Los Padres National Forest next year.
   Officials hope to establish a wild flock there while they keep a
healthy captive flock, he said. Other release areas could include
the Grand Canyon or Northern California.
   Two eggs are under incubation in Los Angeles, and four in San
Diego, making for a possible record breeding season, Wallace said.
The incubation period for condor eggs is about two months.
   Under the captive breeding program, four chicks were hatched
last year, in addition to the one hatched in 1988. The condor's
breeding season runs from January through April. In 1984, eight
eggs were taken from the wild and hatched.
   ``We're hoping for between eight to 10 youngsters this year,''
Wallace said.
   Kareya, like Honsi, appeared healthy and hungry, zoo officials
said.
   ``It's had its first feeding of minced mice,'' Wallace said.

   The first California condor conceived in
captivity hatched Friday, its keepers using tweezers and their
fingertips to help the newest member of the nearly extinct species
break free from its shell, officials said.
   ``It's alive and it looks healthy,'' said Tom Hanscom, a
spokesman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. ``It's resting now.
We don't have any other details.''
   The hatching represents a tremendous boost to efforts to save
the species. It brings the known population of North America's
largest land bird to 28, all in captivity _ 15 at the park here and
13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The squawking infant, named Molloko, an Indian word for
``condor,'' was swaddled in a towel and placed in the same type of
incubator used for premature infants.
   ``Early this morning there were 27 California condors left in
the world,'' said Bill Toone, curator of birds at the park. ``This
afternoon there's 28 of them, and we couldn't be more excited about
that.
   ``When the numbers are so low, one bird is seen as a very big
step away from extinction,'' Toone added.
   Although the tiny bird was not brought forth to ``meet the
press,'' its history-making birth was recorded on videotape and
shown at a press conference Friday night.
   Earlier, the chick had become stuck in dried membrane and
albumen and could no longer rotate in the shell to peck its way
out. Its keepers removed it cautiously because of the danger of
rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes.
   A recording of vultures making hissing and grunting sounds was
played at intervals to duplicate the sounds the chick would hear in
a natural setting.
   Park officials had said they intended to intervene by Saturday
if the chick, which began hatching Wednesday, hadn't emerged from
the shell. Allowing the hatching struggle to continue would
overexhaust the bird.
   The chick, conceived by the only known activing breeding pair of
the California condor, was expected to weigh about 9 ounces,
Hanscom said. The species has a wingspan of up to 10 feet at
maturity.
   The 10-ounce blue-green egg, about 5 inches long, had been under
a 24-hour watch since Wednesday, when keepers noticed ``pip''
cracks in one end signaling the start of hatching, which can take
three days.
   After the egg was laid March 3, it was taken away from the
parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female
bird would produce a second egg. So far, this has not happened.
   It will be a while before the sex of the bird can be determined
through a blood test, officials said.
   Hanscom said that representatives of the Chumash Indian tribe
had been enlisted to select the name for the chick upon hatching.
   The tribe inhabited the Santa Barbara area that most recently
served as California condor habitat, and the bird figures
prominently in the tribe's religion.

<HEAD>`Alert' Condor Chick Takes First Feeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newborn California condor chick gobbled down
its first meal of minced mice and egg yolk and was pronounced alert
and healthy by its anxious keepers.
   An eyedropper was used Thursday to give the bird its first meal,
said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The
bird, hatched Wednesday, is the second California condor to be
conceived and produced in captivity and the 29th known member of
the critically endangered species.
   The initial feeding was withheld until Thursday to give the
chick, named Mandan, time to rest and build an appetite while being
monitored by keepers for signs of a working digestive system.
   ``It gobbled it down. It did so well with the first feeding that
it took two minced mice'' about an hour later, Hanscom said. ``The
chick is alert and active and gives every appearance of a healthy
baby condor.''
   The 6.9-ounce chick was named after an Indian tribe native to
the eastern Rockies where condors lived hundreds of years ago. It
is the offspring of the same condor couple that produced Molloko,
the year-old condor that was the first of the species conceived and
born in captivity.
   Mandan's sex will be determined in several weeks when it's
strong enough to undergo a blood test. Its hatching gives hope for
the future of North America's largest land birds, which have
wingspans up to 9{ feet, Hanscom said.
   Three other fertile condor eggs incubating at the park are
expected to hatch at various times within the next six weeks.
   All California condors known to exist are in the state's two
condor breeding stations. Fifteen birds are at the Wild Animal Park
and 14 at the Los Angeles Zoo.

CREWS LAY TILE HOMES FOR ENDANGERED LEAST TERNS

<P>
Carrying a red clay tile that looked as if it belonged on an Irvine roof, 
Elizabeth McBride looked for a bare spot on a sandy island in the Bolsa Chica 
Ecological Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
McBride and six colleagues from the California Conservation Corps roamed the 
wildlife refuge on Wednesday, searching for spots to place the tiles that the 
endangered least tern will use to shelter its chicks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to see where another good place for a house might be," said 
McBride, 21, of Los Angeles. "I was just thinking, 'If I were a bird, where 
would I want to live?' " 
</P>
<P>
The work of the Conservation Corps members is part of an effort to protect the 
California least tern, a tiny gull-like bird that migrates from Central and 
South America and is expected to arrive at the reserve in about two weeks. "The 
Bolsa Chica area breeds 50% of least terns left on the face of this Earth," 
said Curt Taucher, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game. 
"If we let that get away from us, we won't have any terns left." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are encouraging California taxpayers to make a donation for 
endangered species such as the least tern on state tax forms. About $910,000 
was raised through this campaign last year to benefit rare, threatened and 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
As a flock of sandpipers waded in the nearby marsh, Conservation Corps workers 
scanned the ground, stepping lightly to avoid crushing the nests of other birds 
and scouting spots for tiles. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most of the hand-picked team of workers didn't know what a least 
tern was before this assignment, they enthusiastically installed the artificial 
nests for the gray-and-white terns. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel all the animals should be able to live," said Robert Bolton, 19, of Los 
Angeles. "They have the same right we do." 
</P>
<P>
Chrystie Clark said she had helped clean up oil that washed up on beaches after 
the American Trader spill. She recalled seeing the rescue of an oil-coated 
gull. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I could come out here again," said Clark, 20, of Pleasanton, Calif. 
"You want to do something for (the birds) besides clean up what a human did." 
</P>
<P>
Nature used to take care of sheltering the birds, providing driftwood in which 
fledgling least terns could hide from natural predators such as sparrow hawks, 
crows and red foxes. But the tern is not doing well in its competition with 
humans for open space. 
</P>
<P>
"These birds nest traditionally on bare sand beaches," said Charles Collins, a 
Cal State Long Beach biology professor who specializes in ornithology. "And 
since there's competition for space on the beach for a small bird and lots of 
humans, birds tend to lose out." 
</P>
<P>
After the volunteers finished laying down the tiles on the reserve's northern 
island, they set out for an island to the south, where they cleared land for 
bird nesting. 
</P>
<P>
The effort might seem like a lot of effort for a bird that weighs about 45 
grams when it reaches maturity, but wildlife biologists such as Esther Burkett 
say the endangered species must be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"If the least tern were to disappear, the world wouldn't necessarily stop," 
Burkett said. "(But) at some point, we will lose too many species. You start 
losing one and there are repercussions that start going down the food chain."

PLANNERS SAY NO TO WIND FARM IN HILLS NEAR GORMAN; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL CITES HARM TO BIRDS, RUSTIC SCENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County planners on Wednesday rejected a proposal to build the 
county's first power-generating wind farm in the hills northeast of Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Regional Planning Commission said the project would destroy the 
rustic beauty of the area, promote erosion and harm wildlife, after one 
protester warned that the spinning blades of giant turbines would slice up 
passing birds "like they went through a Cuisinart." 
</P>
<P>
The commission unanimously voted down the proposal after a five-hour hearing 
attended by more than 150 people at Santa Clarita City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Zond Systems, the largest producer of wind energy in California, had hoped to 
erect more than 300 windmills -- some as high as 150 feet -- on vacant, 
mountainous land near the tiny community best known as a truck stop along 
Interstate 5, south of the Kern County line. 
</P>
<P>
Zond's proposal drew opposition from a broad coalition that included the 
California Department of Fish and Game, the National Audubon Society, the 
Sierra Club, a citizens group called Save the Mountain Committee, and Tejon 
Ranch, a wealthy landowning corporation with 200,000 acres in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ralphs Family 
</P>
<P>
Tehachapi-based Zond had the backing of the influential Ralphs family, a 
pioneer Gorman clan that founded the supermarket chain. The proposal had 
divided the small town -- Gorman has only 65 registered voters -- for months. 
The Save the Mountain Committee circulated petitions throughout the county and 
submitted more than 3,000 signatures opposing the windmills. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners heard often-conflicting testimony during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Zond officials cited an environmental impact report that declared that the 
$100-million project would not significantly harm wildlife or the environment. 
The report said the proposed site was outside the routes usually traveled by 
the endangered California condor. The giant condor is now confined to 
captivity, but scientists hope to reintroduce the birds to the region in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Blum of the National Audubon Society said the windmills would raise a 
dangerous barrier in a former condor "flyway." Sherry Teresa, a wildlife 
biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, said the environmental 
impact report was deficient. She said it failed to note that three endangered 
species -- the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and Swainson's hawk -- have been 
sighted at the proposed wind farm site. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Hemsath, speaking for the California State Racing Pigeon Organization, 
said, "Our birds would look like they went through a Cuisinart." 
</P>
<P>
But Steven W. Carothers, an environmental consultant for Zond, countered that 
the number of birds killed by windmills statewide is "relatively 
insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
Zond President James Dehlsen tried to persuade the commissioners by touting 
windmills as clean producers of energy that would reduce pollution and the use 
of gas and oil. 'We like to think we're practicing environmentalists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners rejected his argument, saying their concern was land use, not 
utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
Zond had originally proposed building 458 windmills but scaled that proposal 
down to 350. Dehlsen offered to cut back the proposal to 319 so that none of 
the giant machines would be visible from Interstate 5, a common complaint by 
the project's critics. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners were not swayed. 'I really have a problem with this project," 
Commissioner Betty Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lee Strong agreed that the site was ill-suited to a wind farm but 
said that much of the opposition probably came from landowners with their own 
development plans. Referring to the parade of paid experts who testified for 
the opponents, Strong said: 'You can't tell me that the money that has been 
spent comes strictly from the people. It's coming from people who are concerned 
about 'what is going to happen to my piece of property?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dehlsen said it was too soon to predict whether Zond would appeal the 
commission's decision to the Board of Supervisors.

<LEADPARA>  The world's 42nd California condor celebrated Easter with a meal of pureed
mice after emerging from its shell at the Los Angeles Zoo -- the latest
success story in an attempt to return the endangered birds to the wild.;   
The healthy chick emerged from its pale blue shell at 10:13 p.m. Saturday --
two hours too early for the zoo's public-relations department, said Mike
Wallace, director of the zoo's California Condor Recovery Project.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CONGRATULATIONS, IT'S A CONDOR
CHICK HATCHES IN L.A. ZOO'S CAPTIVE BREEDING
PROGRAM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "You could tell our PR department was really trying to get us to slow this
bird down so he would hatch on Easter," chuckled Wallace, who noted it would
have been the zoo's second Easter hatching in a row.;    "But as long as they
are healthy, we don't care when they hatch," he said.;    The new chick --
whose gender won't be known for three months or so -- was named Pawoko, a
Kawaiisu Indian word for condor drawn from a list provided by the state Native
American Commission.;    "We're feeling really good," said Wallace. "This was
a really healthy hatch. The chick came out unassisted and weighed around 6
ounces.";    Pawoko is the sixth condor to be hatched in Los Angeles since the
zoo's participation in the joint program with the San Diego Wild Animal Park
began two years ago. Wallace has hopes it will be among the first of more than
a dozen birds to emerge this year.;    If the condors continue to breed as
successfully as they have in the past, it's possible that a small number could
be released into the wild by the end of the year -- almost two years ahead of
schedule, he said.;    In 1987, when biologists rounded up the last of the 27
wild condors known to exist, they hoped their controversial captive breeding
program would enable them to increase the species sufficiently to re-introduce
them into a remote Ventura County sanctuary.;    With a 9 1/2-foot wingspan
that makes them North America's largest bird, the condors in prehistoric times
ranged up and down the Pacific Coast. The bird's decline is believed to be a
result of the introduction of man into their habitat.  </TEXT>

   The first California condor born to captive
parents is downing about 30 minced mice a day and slowly gaining
weight, say keepers who are watching the bald, fluffy chick for
infection.
   ``So far so good,'' Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the San Diego
Wild Animal Park, said Sunday. ``We're not through the most
critical period, which is 72 hours.''
   The chick, named Molloko, an Indian word condor, was hatched
with human help Friday, boosting the endangered species' numbers to
28.
   It ate 28 mice Saturday and 30 more by Sunday afternoon, Ms.
Baker said.
   ``The appetite of the bird is very good,'' said Ms. Baker,
adding that the chick had regained its birth rate of 6} ounces. As
adults, the birds have a wingspan up to 10 feet.
   The chick had very bright eyes and its bodily functions seemed
to be operating correctly, she said.
   The fist-sized bird's attachment to its yolk sac, similar to a
human infant's umbilical cord, was healing well.
   Molloko hatched from an egg laid by the only pair of California
condors known to be actively breeding.
   All 28 California condors known to exist are in captivity: 15 at
the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo. Fourteen birds
are female. The chick's sex has not been determined.
   The flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in the
wild during the past five years. Molloko was the first addition
since April 1986, when a chick hatched at the park from an egg laid
in the wild.
   Efforts to save the California condor from extinction rest with
the captive breeding program. The last known condor in the wild was
captured last year.

Armed with signs, two-way radios and portable fences, Ventura County 
bird-watchers are helping safeguard a small gray-and-white bird species that 
faces extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The California least tern, listed as being at risk since 1970, nests along the 
California coastline between the months of May and August. Nesting sites in 
Ventura County include a section of the Santa Clara River estuary in Ventura, 
Point Mugu and Ormond Beach in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The birds lay their purple-and-brown speckled eggs near the water and must be 
protected from beach-goers, who could easily trample them, said Don Davis, vice 
president of the western Ventura County chapter of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
The birds scrape a spot in the sand and lay their eggs, which are well 
camouflaged. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are protected at their breeding grounds at Point Mugu because the 
Navy property is off-limits to most people. And the Ormond Beach nesting area, 
a favorite for off-road vehicles, has been partially sealed off and is 
patrolled by the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Santa Clara River estuary, the terns nest in an increasingly popular 
area. So for the past five years, the Audubon Society -- with help from the 
city of Ventura, the Ventura Port District, the state Fish and Game Commission 
and McGrath State Beach rangers -- fences a 500-by-200-foot area of beach as a 
breeding ground from late April to late August. 
</P>
<P>
The four-foot-high chain-link fence cuts the area off to foot traffic and is 
surrounded by signs informing people that it is a nesting area. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, about 45 Audubon Society members rotate shifts from noon until 
dark, answering questions and keeping people at a distance from the birds, who 
make a distinctive sound like a Kewpie doll squeaking, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are understanding and cooperative," said monitor Bobbe Dorsey of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But unleashed dogs have to be chased away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Monitors carry two-way radios to notify rangers or police if they need help but 
have not had to use them, Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
The fence also protects the terns from wild cats, foxes and weasels that live 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The terns themselves handle threats from aerial predators. 
</P>
<P>
When a sea gull flies over the nesting area, the colony of about 45 terns takes 
flight and harasses it. 
</P>
<P>
"Terns are very agile and can fly loops around a poor old lumbering gull," 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the colony is larger than usual, in part because the Point Mugu 
nesting ground was washed out by a storm Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It is now mating season for the gray-and-white birds, which are about nine 
inches long with a 20-inch wing span. In the birds' mating ritual, the male 
first presents the female with a fish and bobs his head repeatedly. After they 
mate, the female lays one to four eggs within a couple of days. Incubation 
lasts 3 1/2 weeks with parents taking turns on the nest. 
</P>
<P>
Within a day of breaking from the shell, the speckled chicks can scurry to hide 
under the short dune plants. 
</P>
<P>
Both parents catch minnows and sticklebacks from nearby ponds or smelt from the 
ocean to feed their hungry brood. 
</P>
<P>
As chicks grow feathers, the family leaves the nest to live by various ponds in 
the county, including those at golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, the terns fly south to winter in southern Baja California and 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about 1,233 pairs of least terns bred at 28 sites between San Diego 
and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a field study by the state 
Department of Fish and Game. CAROL WEINSTOCK

<HEAD>Andean Condors To Be Released As Forerunners To California Condors</HEAD>

   Four young Andean condors are going to be
introduced to the Los Padres National Forest in an experiment that
wildlife experts hope will lead the way to eventually returning
California condors to the wild.
   Scientists said Thursday they believe the information they get
from monitoring the Andean condors will help them avoid problems
when they begin releasing California condors in the early 1990s.
   There are only 28 known California condors, the largest flying
birds in North America, and all of them are at the Los Angeles Zoo
and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. Scientists hope to save the
species by breeding the birds in captivity to build up the
population and later releasing them.
   The last free California condor was captured in April 1987.
   Although the Andean condors, which are native to South America,
are considered endangered, there are thousands of them.
   Researchers in the two-year, $200,000 program will start with
newborn condors that haven't developed any domesticated habits.
   Nine zoos have sent eggs to the Los Angeles Zoo and the wild
animal park. After hatching, the chicks will be kept in captivity
for three months, using puppets that resemble adult condors to feed
them, said Michael Wallace, curator of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo
and the project's field coordinator.
   ``We have to make sure the birds have some fear of humans to
protect them,'' Wallace said. ``When they see a human on the
horizon, it may be a hunter.''
   At the age of three months the birds will be taken to a large
outdoor cage, and they will be released when they are about 7
months old, the age they would normally leave the nest, Wallace
said.
   The first chicks will be three months old next month and are
tentatively scheduled to be moved the weekend of Aug. 19 to a spot
near the Hopper Mountain Wildlife Refuge in northern Ventura
County, northwest of Los Angeles.
   A group of eight scientists and technicians and 200 volunteers
will monitor the birds' moves by radio transmitters to distinguish
eating patterns and other habits. Scientists said they will provide
food for the birds throughout the experiment.
   The observers will periodically recapture the birds to monitor
their health and check their transmitters, Wallace said.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead agency in the
program, will provide protection for the birds, wildlife inspector
Ron Drifka said.

   The first egg produced by a pair of captive
California condors is a huge success for biologists trying to save
the endangered species, even if it proves to be infertile, a
curator says.
   The egg, laid Thursday at San Diego Wild Animal Park, will be
inspected for fertility Monday, officials said.
   ``If it's not fertile, we would still remain happy,'' said Bill
Toone curator of birds for the San Diego Zoo, which is affiliated
with the park. ``We (now) know they will breed in captivity.''
   Only 27 of the giant birds exist, all in captivity at the park
or the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The 10-ounce, pale blue-green egg was moved from a nest to an
electronic incubator, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. If fertile,
the egg is expected to hatch within two months.
   The egg may be infertile because the female is old and her mate
may be sexually immature, park officials said.
   By taking the egg from its parents at an early point, scientists
hope to induce the pair to produce a second egg to replace the one
they lost.
   The incubator will maintain a constant temperature and humidity
for the egg. Handlers will turn it 180 degrees twice a day,
imitating the behavior of a mother condor's care in the wild.
   California condors, which have a wingspan of about 9 feet, are
dark reddish-brown, with a curved beak. They were decimated in the
wild by lead poisoning from eating lead shot in animal carcasses,
biologists said.
   The last one living in the wild was captured and brought to the
Wild Animal Park last April in the effort to save the species.
   Since 1981, scientists have successfully hatched 13 condors in
captivity from eggs taken in the wild.
   Wildlife biologists hope to breed sufficient numbers of the
condor in captivity and release the captive-bred birds into a safe
environment in the wild.

   The Philadelphia Zoo has bred the Guam rail, a small tropical
bird that resembles a sandpiper. The Cincinnati Zoo implanted an
embryo from an endangered Indian desert cat into a surrogate mother
- a domestic house cat that nursed the kitten as if it were her
own.
   At the aquarium in Baltimore's redeveloped Inner Harbor, still
one of the most polluted areas of the Chesapeake Bay, a collection
of crickets, wax worms, fruit flies and other insects are kept in
rows of bottles on a shelf in a cramped, pungent work area behind
the rain forest exhibit.
   Above the bottles is a sign reading, ``Time flies like an arrow,
fruit flies like a banana.''
   What blue poison dart frogs like is a diet high in calcium and
phosphorous, humidity and privacy. The three-quarter-inch,
blue-and-black frog is so-named because it secretes a deadly
alkaloid similar to curare, which South American Indians use to
make poison darts.
   ``In the wild they lay their eggs under large jungle leaves,''
Cover says. ``We've found the bottom of 2-liter soda bottles are a
real good breeding hut. We put a plastic leaf in a petri dish and
put the bottle over the top.
   ``The male does a courtship dance. The female, if receptive,
follows him in and does an elaborate courtship dance with all kinds
of stroking and spinning. Then she lays her eggs and he'll
fertilize them.''
   Cover and his colleagues are still working on how to get the
frogs to produce the toxin medical researchers want to study.
Herpetologists and others have tried several unorthodox methods.
   Special diets didn't work, nor did daily handling of the frogs.
They thought cold baths, which would simulate the dangers of the
wild, might be the key.
   ``We actually tested that hypothesis,'' Cover says. ``But in the
wild the frog would already have to have the poison the first time
a predator comes down. There wouldn't be a second chance. So,
danger doesn't seem like it would stimulate production.''
   Perhaps the mostnown endangered species is the California
condor, the largest land bird in North America, which has a
wingspan of up to 10 feet. There are 40 California condors known to
exist and all are in captivity - 21 at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park and 19 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The last condor known to exist in the wild was captured in 1987.
Before 1985, scientists had hoped to breed them in captivity and in
the wild, but between 1984 and 1985, four of the last five breeding
pairs in the wild were lost and presumed dead. In 1985, federal
officials decided to capture all remaining wild condors in a
last-ditch effort to save the species.
   That effort drew criticism from several environmental groups,
but it appears to have been the right choice.
   ``When we first hatched birds in captivity, it was pretty
exciting,'' says Dr. Michael Wallace, curator of birds at the Los
Angeles Zoo. ``We were under a lot of pressure from outside groups
to release the birds. It's good to see we could not only do it, but
do it fairly well.''
   Four of the vulture-like chicks were hatched this year at the
San Diego park and four at the Los Angeles Zoo. That success has
enabled zoologists to consider reintroducing some of the condors
into the wild as early as next year, several years ahead of
schedule.
   Despite their successes, zoologists are quick to remind that
breeding programs are only part of the solution.
   ``Zoos are looking at being part of a holistic program,''
Hutchins says. ``If we are going to save species, we just can't
save them in zoos. But at least having these populations in
captivity provides us with the option of reintroducing them.''

<HEAD>California Has Biggest Death Row, No Executions</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS lead to CORRECT that California does not have largest

explaining that California has largest death row among the 25
states which have not resumed executions</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   For more than two decades, the gas
chamber at San Quentin prison has been idle while California built
up one of the nation's largest Death Row populations.
   For those 231 prisoners, all of them men, the countdown has
begun.
   ``The cases are moving along now,'' said Gary Mullen, executive
director of the California District Attorneys Association, the
state's foremost prosecutors' organization. ``We expect that in the
near future, probably before the end of the year, there will be a
death penalty case that will be cleared all the way through the
state Supreme Court.''
   ``There has been a dramatic change in the (state) court,'' adds
John Meehan, district attorney of Alameda County and one of the
state's foremost death penalty experts. ``An execution could occur
by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.''
   Throughout the nation, 100 people have been executed since the
U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death penalty in
1976. So far, only 12 of the 37 states with capital punishment laws
have resumed executions. Of the 25 states which have not,
California has the largest death-row population.
   This year, the California Supreme Court reversed one of its most
important earlier rulings that impeded executions, declaring that a
killer can be put to death even if there was no intent to murder.
   The ruling marked a sharp departure from the philosophy of the
previous Supreme Court, dominated for a decade by the liberal
appointees of former Gov. Jerry Brown. His chief justice, Rose
Bird, was removed from office by voters in 1986 along with two
liberal colleagues.
   In one year, the new court under Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas has
affirmed more than a dozen death sentences, compared to four death
sentences affirmed during the 10-year tenure of the Bird court.
   The court now is controlled by a 5-2 majority appointed by
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who as a state senator sponsored
the 1977 death penalty act.
   Under California law, all death sentences are automatically
reviewed by the state Supreme Court. If the state high court
affirms the decision, the death sentence is appealed directly to
the U.S. Supreme Court, followed by a second round of challenges,
raising issues not addressed previously and often focusing on the
competency of the defendant's original attorney. The litigation
commonly takes years.
   ``There has been a dramatic turnaround,'' said Mullen. ``I think
the state Supreme Court has become more mainstream _ 80 percent of
Californians support the death penalty, according to polls.''
   ``The death penalty cases are speeding along,'' said Michael
Laurence, a San Francisco attorney who handles death penalty
appeals. ``It was difficult before, because you are working uphill
for a person who has already been convicted and sentenced to death.
Now, it's a little more difficult.''
   California's Legislature moved quickly to restore capital
punishment following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling that
permitted executions to resume.
   A narrow death penalty bill, sponsored by Deukmejian, was
approved by the Legislature in 1977 and vetoed by Brown. The
Legislature, for the first time, overrode Brown's veto.
   In November 1978, California voters approved a death penalty
initiative extending capital punishment to accomplices and other
types of murders not covered by Deukmejian's legislation. Most of
the controversial state Supreme Court rulings dealing with the
penalty have focused on the meaning and constitutionality of the
initiative.
   Depending upon the course of their respective court battles, the
next to die will probably be one of three killers: Robert Alton
Harris of San Diego, Stevie Lamar Fields of Los Angeles or Earl
Lloyd Jackson of Long Beach.
   ``They are regarded as the furthest along,'' said Bob Gore, a
spokesman for the state Corrections Department. ``As to which one
it will be, right now we can't say.''
   Prosecutors, led by Alameda County District Attorney John
Meehan, a death penalty expert, believe the most likely prospect is
Harris, who gunned down two teen-agers in north San Diego County
after stealing their car for a 1978 bank robbery. After the
killings, Harris calmly munched hamburgers he'd taken from his
victims, according to court testimony from an accomplice.
   Fields kidnapped, tortured, raped and killed a University of
Southern California librarian. Jackson raped and murdered two women
in their 80s on successive nights.
   Executions were common in California for more than a century,
with 502 people put to death, by rope or by gas, between 1851 and
1967.
   The last to die was Sacramento cop-killer Aaron Mitchell, who
was executed at San Quentin while Jerry Brown led a candlelight
vigil outside the prison. Ronald Reagan, then the state's governor,
and his clemency secretary, Edwin Meese III, declined to intervene
to block the execution.
   California's two most notorious killers _ cultist Charles Manson
and Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F. Kennedy _ are not on
death row, since their crimes occurred prior to 1972, when the
capital punishment statute was overturned.
   Perhaps the two most famous California executions were those of
Caryl Chessman and Barbara Graham.
   Chessman, the ``red light bandit'' who committed 17 crimes
during a 20-day Los Angeles spree in 1948, went to his death
smiling on May 5, 1960. A prolific author and jailhouse lawyer,
Chessman captured international attention as he evaded eight
execution dates. In 1961, the UCLA Law Review called Chessman's
court battle ``the most extensively litigated case in the annals of
American criminal law.''
   Chessman was executed for kidnapping and robbery, not murder.
Under current law, criminals can only be executed if the crime
involves a death.
   Graham, known in the press as ``Babs the Party Girl,'' was
executed in 1955 for the murder of an elderly invalid woman. Her
two accomplices were also put to death in a triple-execution day at
San Quentin.
   Graham's odyssey from petty theft to murder was depicted in the
1958 movie, ``I Want to Live,'' starring Susan Hayward. She won an
Oscar for the performance.

<LEADPARA>  IT HAUNTS scruffy thickets of brush dotting the coastal hills and valleys.
Fluttering amid the sagebrush and buckwheat, incognito in slate-gray feathers,
the California gnatcatcher seems the embodiment of the common bird.;    But
common it is not.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HUMBLE BIRD AT CENTER OF CAT FIGHT BETWEEN
DEVELOPERS, PROTECTORS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Much like the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest or the endangered desert
tortoise, the tiny songbird has become the centerpiece of an ongoing slugfest
between big business and environmentalists, developers and slow-growth
advocates.;    Barbs continued to fly last week as the state Fish and Game
Commission began weighing the gnatcatcher's destiny -- whether to declare it a
candidate for endangered species status or, as biologists fear, allow the bird
to skitter toward extinction. After half a day of testimony Thursday, the
commission put off a decision until late this month.;    As the human hubbub
plays out, the gnatcatcher remains something of a mystery, even to some of its
most devout supporters and detractors.;    With a wingspan no bigger than your
palm and a shrill, drawn-out call often compared to the plaintive mew of a
kitten, the gnatcatcher is a bird hard to  dislike.;    IN FACT, this tiny
creature could teach humans a thing or two. Ornithologists say the bird is
industrious. When it comes to building a nest, both sexes are champion
carpenters.;    Gnatcatchers appear to stick to the same bushy neighborhood
from year to year instead of periodically pulling up roots for greener
pastures. They also typically prove to be devoted mates and doting parents.
The gnatcatcher is also a virtuoso singer, trilling its tunes incessantly
through the day.;    Despite such virtues, the bird has something of an
identity problem.;    For starters, the gnatcatcher does not eat gnats.
Instead, it feasts on other types of small, sedentary insects plucked from
certain bushes and brush. Aphids and small beetles are a gnatcatcher's haute
cuisine.;    The tiny creature has also had something of a roller-coaster ride
just getting recognized by biologists as a separate species, independent of
other gnatcatchers scattered throughout the continent.;    In 1881, the
California gnatcatcher was spotlighted as its own species, distinct from the
more prevalent black-tailed gnatcatcher, which thrives in sections of the
Southwest and in the heart of Mexico. In 1926, ornithologists reversed
themselves and lumped the coastal bird with its inland cousin.;    There it
stayed for more than half a century. Finally, in 1988, the California
gnatcatcher once again was designated a distinct creature.;    The final proof
was in the bird's voice.;    Jonathan L. Atwood, then a doctoral candidate at
the University of California, Los Angeles, ventured to California gnatcatcher
territory armed with a tape recorder. Atwood turned up the volume and, as
gnatcatchers flitted about in the bushes, began playing recordings of
birdcalls from a spate of species.;    When the chirps of the black-tailed
variety and others blared over the loudspeakers, the local gnatcatchers did
not stir. Birds, after all, typically are not riled by the calls of other
species, which are not considered a threat to steal their mates, Atwood said.;
   When the distinctive mews of the California gnatcatcher echoed through the
outback, the birds he was watching invariably flew to the tape recorder and
attacked it, suspecting that the machine was somehow one of their own trying
to invade sovereign territory.;    That evidence, along with plumage
noticeably distinct from the feathers of the black-tailed variety, is cited by
most ornithologists as proof that the California gnatcatcher -- or Polioptila
californica -- is its own bird.;    And a vanishing bird at that.;    As
development and agriculture swept across Southern California, houses and farms
gobbled up the gnatcatcher's prime habitat, a rare mix of softwood bushes
known as coastal sage scrub.;    That arid scrub, which drops its leaves
during dry spells, is now recognized as among the most quickly vanishing types
of vegetation in the United States. Along with its demise has come the
disappearance of the gnatcatcher and a host of other birds, reptiles and
mammals that make their home in the coastal sage.;    ABOUT HALF of the
remaining scrub is spread through San Diego County. Environmentalists say much
of the prime gnatcatcher habitat in Orange County lies in two sweeping
stretches owned by developers -- the coastal hills held by the Irvine Co. and
canyons northwest of Ortega Highway owned by the Santa Margarita Co.;   
Developers who oppose listing the bird as endangered say they have nothing
against the gnatcatcher but believe a sufficient amount of habitat can be set
aside without blocking their building plans.;    Environmentalists strongly
disagree. Most fear that the bird is teetering at the abyss.;    Atwood -- now
a noted ornithologist at the Manomet Bird Observatory in Plymouth, Mass. --
and other experts suspect that only 1,200 to 2,000 pairs are left, all of them
residing in a narrow band near the Southern California coast from the Palos
Verdes Peninsula to the Mexican border. At the present rate, the bird could be
gone in 20 years, they contend.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  CONDORS TO BE RELEASED TO WILD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The release of Hoinewut and Chocuyens, hatched at the Los Angeles Zoo and
San Diego Wild Animal Park, will mark a turning point in a long, costly and
often controversial captive breeding program to save the bird from
extinction.;    When the last of the wild birds was caught in 1987, only 27
California condors existed because of loss of habitat, poachers, DDT and lead
poisoning.;    "The feeling of elation is very hard to describe," said Bill
Toone, curator of birds at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and a key member of
the California Condor Recovery Team, which includes federal and state
officials.;    "People told us we couldn't save these wonderful birds, they
said we wouldn't be able to breed them," he said. "And here we are, actually
planning to re-release the California condor back into the wild. It is truly a
historic day.";    Marvin L. Plenert, regional director of the U.S. Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service, said the recovery team will release the chicks in October or
November into the bird's historic habitat -- the Sespe Condor Sanctuary of Los
Padres National Forest, 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles.;    After being
flown to the release site at the Hopper Mountain Refuge within the Sespe
sanctuary, the birds will kept at first within a netted "flight pen"
surrounding a rocky cliff about 3,700 feet above sea level.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Zoo Finds Second Egg Laid By Endangered Birds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two eggs laid by captive pairs of endangered
California condors have been placed in incubation while anxious
scientists wait to learn whether either one is fertile, zoo
officials said.
   The newest egg, discovered Tuesday at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park, was produced by condors UN1 and AC4 one day after an egg was
found at the state's other breeding station at the Los Angeles Zoo,
park spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   ``We've had in hand 18 eggs and this one is on the small side,
but we've seen healthy birds hatch from smaller eggs,'' he said.
   Both eggs must incubate for about a week before keepers will be
able to tell whether they're fertile. If so, a chick could hatch in
about two months if there are no complications, officials said.
   The egg found Monday at the Los Angeles Zoo was removed Tuesday
from the plywood nest box of male Cuyama and female Cachuma when
both vultures were away from it, zoo spokeswoman Lora LaMarca said.
   The 8{-ounce egg, about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide, was
placed in a padded wooden box with hot water bottles to keep it warm
during the trip to the state's other condor breeding station at the
Wild Animal Park.
   The egg was transferred to the northern San Diego County park
because the Los Angeles Zoo is installing new incubation facilities,
LaMarca said.
   Dr. Mike Wallace, curator of birds at Los Angeles Zoo, said after
the egg was laid Monday that he hoped to collect as many as three
eggs from Cuyama and Cachuma during the January through April laying
season.
   The condors recycle their mating habits if their nest loses an
egg, and the female usually takes a month to produce another egg, he
said.
   All 28 California condors known to remain alive are in captivity,
half at the Los Angeles Zoo and half at the Wild Animal Park near
Escondido. The condor eggs discovered this week are among the only
three laid in captivity.

   A tiny California condor chick that scientists
say represents the salvation of its species pecked a hole in its
eggshell today, officials said.
   Keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park are keeping a
round-the-clock vigil over the egg, the first produced by captive
California condors under a program started 15 years ago to save the
nearly extinct species, spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   The chick should win its struggle to break out of the the
blue-green shell within the next three days, he said. It began
using its lungs for the first time Sunday when it pushed its beak
into an air pocket at the egg's narrow end.
   The chipping of a small hole in the shell, or pipping, begins a
critical phase in the bird's development, Hanscom said.
   ``We have a remote TV camera on the egg, monitoring it
constantly,'' Hanscom said. ``And every hour the egg is physically
tapped by a keeper to provide the same outside stimulation one
might expect from a natural mother in the nest.''
   If the chick fails to hatch itself by Saturday morning, keepers
and veterinarians will step in and help it get out, Hansom said.
The chick will be hand-raised by keepers using a puppet resembling
an adult condor for feeding.
   The chick is especially susceptible to infection and exhaustion
now that it has broken through the eggshell, Hanscom said.
   The California condor, North America's largest land bird with a
wing span of up to 10 feet, once ranged along the Pacific coast
from Canada to Mexico.
   Only 27 California condors are known to exist today, all in
captivity at the wild animal park and the Los Angeles Zoo, the last
wild bird having been captured last year.
   The fertile egg, laid March 3, was the culmination of an
elaborate courtship dance and mating of a young male designated AC4
and his older mate, UN1. The egg was removed from the park's
``condorminium'' and placed in an incubator.
   Exhaustion from trying to break the shell could kill the chick,
but keepers must allow 72 hours to pass before intervening, Hanscom
said. If they step in too early, they could cause the chick to
bleed to death by rupturing a membrane of blood cells that the
condor needs to absorb, he said.
   ``We don't want to be pessimistic, but we are very anxious at
this time,'' Hanscom said.
   Thirteen of 14 condor eggs taken from nests in the wild have
hatched in captivity, all with human assistance, he said.
   The chick's parents have continued to mate, raising hopes for a
second egg. At the Los Angeles Zoo, two other potential mating
pairs have failed to begin the courtship dance.
   Hanscom said the pairs may not have adjusted to captivity or may
be incompatible.
   ``These birds mate for life and here we are chosing mates
artificially for them,'' he said. ``That might not always take. The
birds may not always decide to follow our magic making.''
   Scientists sought to begin the condor capture-breeding program
during the 1950s but were delayed by opposition by the National
Audubon Society and others.
   The opponents eventually were pacified by assurances that the
condors' natural habitat would be protected and that a wild
population eventually would be re-established.
   Federal and state agencies have joined the multimillion-dollar
effort to regenerate the birds.
   The success of the program won't be known for years, as the
oldest bird hatched in captivity is 5 years old and condors reach
maturity at age 7, Hanscom said.
   The egg's parents were taken from the wild, and the male only
reached maturity last summer. But Hanscom is convinced condors born
in captivity also will produce eggs such as the one now watched
intently.
   ``The chick that hatches from this egg represents the
regeneration of this species,'' he said. ``Captive breeding is
their only hope for survival.''

Pacific Lumber Co.'s plan to log 453 acres of old-growth timber in the north 
coast Headwaters Forest was rejected Friday by the California Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
CDF officials cited concerns for the rare marbled murrelet, a robin-sized bird 
that nests in the tops of ancient redwood trees near the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the latest obstacle to Pacific Lumber's plans to log the 3,000 
acres of virgin timber east of Eureka known as the Headwaters Forest. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit by environmental groups has blocked the company from carrying out 
state-approved plans to cut 319 acres in the forest, the largest remaining 
privately owned grove of ancient redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also highlighted growing public concern over the environmental 
impact of logging old-growth forests, where giant trees up to 1,500 years old 
shelter unique species of wildlife, including the controversial northern 
spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
The owl's listing as an endangered species by the federal government last month 
angered the timber industry, which said it could cost thousands of jobs. Unlike 
the spotted owl, the marbled murrelet is not listed as an endangered species by 
either the federal government or the state of California, although conservation 
groups have filed petitions to have it listed. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Lumber President John Campbell said the CDF decision was "based on 
political rather than scientific reasons." Pacific Lumber already has agreed to 
study the murrelet population and take steps to protect the birds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Lumber has 10 days to appeal the CDF decision to the state Board of 
Forestry.

   Federal officials proposed that a tiny California songbird
be placed on the endangered species list, despite an
unusually heavy lobbying campaign from business interests and
their political allies.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the
California coastal gnatcatcher faces possible extinction
because its habitat, the low scrub and sagebrush that dots
the southern California coast, is being plowed under for
housing tracts. The action triggers a one-year review
process, which is almost certain to result in consequently
listing the bird as endangered and requiring potentially
drastic measures to save it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move was a blow to a host of big-time California
developers, including Irvine Cos., Baldwin Co. and Santa
Margarita Co. They and other developers, who own much of what
remains of the gnatcatcher habitat, have mounted a lobbying
blitz in Sacramento and Washington to convince state and
federal wildlife officials not to list the bird as
endangered. The developers have spent more than $1 million on
studies they contend refute federal and state scientists'
findings that the gnatcatcher is imperiled. And they predict
that granting the bird endangered status will stall
construction, cost jobs and generally be an economic
calamity.
   While environmentalists dispute those claims, developers
seemed to be gaining the upper hand in the gnatcatcher debate
last week, when California officials declined to list the
bird as endangered under state wildlife laws, despite state
scientists' strong recommendation that they do so.
   "Obviously, we're disappointed" (with the federal
decision), said Don Steffensen, vice president of Lusk Co., a
developer based in Irvine, Calif. He said it's too early to
say what specific impact the agency's ruling will have, but
added that the "effect on the economy could be severe."
   The Fish and Wildlife Service's action enhances the
gnatcatcher dispute's status as an important test case in
escalating battles over how far to go to protect wildlife,
and in the debate over the Endangered Species Act itself. The
act is up for reauthorization next year. And many
environmentalists expect an attack on the law from business
interests who believe the law's protections, in some cases,
are causing too much economic and social dislocation for
people.
   Environmentalists hailed the proposed listing. "We are
pleased and relieved . . . and grateful for the fact that the
federal government is willing to enforce the law," said Joel
Reynolds, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group. "Slowly but surely,
the gnatcatcher is moving toward being protected." The
listing also eased concerns expressed recently by some
federal scientists that top agency officials might buckle
under the heavy lobbying. "My faith is restored," said one
federal scientist.
   However, the gnatcatcher clearly isn't out of the woods
yet. Developers said they will push their case during the
one-year review. They charged the agency with ignoring new
studies they say demonstrate that there is more coastal sage
habitat than federal scientists say, that there are millions
of gnatcatchers in Mexico and that the coastal gnatcatcher
may not be a separate species at all. "The (agency's data) is
the weakest of reeds upon which to base a decision that will
launch this amount of economic chaos," said Hugh Hewitt, an
attorney for developers.
   The proposed listing has little immediate effect, other
than to intitiate the review period. Theoretically, the Fish
and Wildlife Service could change its recommendation after
the review. But in the hundreds of cases of plants and
animals that have gone through the listing procedures, there
is believed to be only one instance -- involving a desert
plant known as the mathis spiderling -- in which the agency
reversed a proposed listing. In that case, studies done
during the review period discovered thriving colonies of
mathis spiderling in Mexico and other areas, leading the
agency to conclude it wasn't in danger of extinction.
   The recommended listing of the gnatcatcher could be a
boost for an embryonic state plan being pushed by
California's Department of Resources that calls for
developers to cooperate with the state and with
environmentalists to create broad zones of protected habitat
along the coast. The plan, which state officials see as a
potential model for resolving other environmental disputes in
the nation, seeks to balance the demands of development with
those of nature and to avoid protracted battles that have
erupted recently over gnatcatchers, spotted owls and other
species. Environmentalists hope that with the prospect of
eventual listing of the gnatcatcher now on the horizon,
developers will have more incentive to cooperate with the
state plan.

<HEAD>Year's Third Endangered Condor Chick Coaxed From Egg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California condor chick was coaxed from its
egg Sunday as keepers clucked over the year's third successful
hatching in an ongoing effort to save the giant vulture from
extinction.
   The chick, named Kaduku, was the first conceived by a pair of
6-year-old birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, changing biologists'
notions about when condors reach sexual maturity, said San Diego
Wild Animal Park spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   ``It previously was not known if California condors achieved
full sexual maturity at age 6 or 7,'' Hanscom said. ``It was
thought to be 7 but these birds proved us wrong.''
   The sparsely feathered bird, hatched from a pale aqua-colored
egg laid on Easter Sunday, weighed 5.8 ounces after it was helped
from the shell by handlers at the San Diego park around 11:20 a.m.,
Hanscom said.
   ``It was our Easter egg,'' said Los Angeles Zoo spokeswoman
Cindy Richardson. ``It looks really healthy and is doing great.''
   The baby, whose Konkow Indian name means ``very strong being,
both physically and spiritually,'' joined two other chicks at the
park's so-called ``condorminium'' and was scheduled to take its
first meal of minced mouse meat Sunday night.
   The baby bird, conceived by a pair of birds named Cayuma and
Cachuma, was the fourth captive-bred condor chick successfully
hatched, bringing the world's California condor population to 31.
   All remaining wild condors, which are North America's largest
land birds, have been captured in hopes of building their numbers
in captivity.
   Seventeen condors are housed at the animal park in northern San
Diego County, about 30 miles northeast of downtown San Diego, and
the other 14 live at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Sunday's hatching followed one on Thursday and the year's first
on April 19. The first captive-bred chick, named Molloko, hatched
in 1988 and remains in good health as do the other chicks.
   Like all previous captive condor chicks, Kaduku was brought to
the ``condormimium'' in San Diego as soon as the egg was laid in
hopes the parents would produce another egg to replace it.
   The female Cachuma previously produced another egg, but it was
infertile.
   Los Angeles Zoo officials have been encouraged by the pair's
continued affectionate behavior, saying they hoped the birds would
become productive members of the breeding program.
   The chicks are raised by handlers who use lifelike
condor-replica puppets to feed the birds, allowing for close
scrutiny of their daily progress by while maintaining the chicks'
identification with their own kind.
   The captive-breeding program was established when numbers of the
black carrion-eaters dwindled because of shooting and pesticide
contamination.

   A California condor chick emerged from its shell
Tuesday, marking the fourth captive hatching in the most productive
breeding season for the critically endangered bird since 1984,
officials said.
   Named Shasta for the volcanic California mountain that was once a
range for North America's largest land bird, the chick was helped
out of its shell by keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park, said park
spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   The egg was removed from its nest at the park's ``condorminium''
soon after it was produced April 9 by the parents of Molloko and
Mandan, the first and second California condors to be born and bred
in captivity.
   The bird's gender will be determined by a blood test, Hanscom
said.
   The hatching process began Saturday, when the chick pecked a hole
in its shell. During the final seven minutes, keepers cracked away
bits of shell until the 6.8-ounce chick was freed.
   ``This is the most productive year since 1984, when eight condor
eggs were taken from the wild and six successfully hatched,'' said
Hanscom. He said a seventh condor was born in the wild that year,
but five condor deaths in the wilderness reduced the net population
gain to two.
   Shasta's hatching raised the species' population to 32. It also
represented the first successful ``double-clutch'' in captivity,
Hanscom said.
   Condors naturally produce a single egg each year but often lay a
replacement egg if the first is lost early in the egg-laying season.
   All condors known to exist are in captivity _ 18 at the San Diego
Wild Animal Park and 14 at the Los Angeles Zoo. The goal of the
program is to rebuild the population to the point where condors can
be reintroduced into the wild.
   Hanscom said keepers hope to release an initial group of condors
in 1992.

   Six Andean condors are
napping and munching on beef and chopped rats as they await release
into the wild in an experiment aimed at saving their California
condor cousins from extinction.
   ``It will be a credit to humankind if we can preserve the animals
of the Earth, and the condor is but one animal facing dire
straits,'' said Jeff Opdycke, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
official who toured the Andean condor release site with reporters
Tuesday.
   Of thousands of California condors that once soared in the early
1800s, only 28 of the vulture-like, carrion-eating birds remain
alive. With 9-1@2-foot wingspans, they are North America's largest
bird.
   All the survivors are in captive breeding programs at the Los
Angeles Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   In five to 10 years, after enough of them have produced offspring
in captivity, some of the young birds will be re-introduced into the
wild in another attempt to avoid extinction.
   To learn the best way to release the California condors and
assure their survival, researchers are using young Andean condors
donated by various zoos as stand-ins for their more endangered
relatives. One thousand to 2,000 Andean condors remain in the wilds
of South America.
   ``These are surrogates,'' said Joseph Dowhan, condor recovery
coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ``We're going to test
release techniques, release sites, and train people.''
   Seven of the Andean birds will be freed in December and January
into the 53,000-acre Sespe Condor Sanctuary, 50 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.
   Along with up to 10 others to be freed late next year, they will
be rounded up when the $440,000 study is done in two or three years,
then released permanently in their native Colombia.
   About a dozen reporters were allowed to observe three of the
birds on Tuesday in a tour led by officials of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, the U.S. Forest Service, National Audubon Society, and Los
Angeles Zoo.
   The three young female condors, all about five months old and
weighing 19 to 21 pounds, sat in the shade, napping in the
net-enclosed half of their 35-by-16-foot roosting box, which sits
atop sawed-off telephone poles 10 feet above the ground to protect
them from black bears and coyotes.
   Biologists sneak into the cage at night to deliver meals of calf
meat, ground horse meat and chopped rats, said Mike Wallace, the Los
Angeles Zoo's curator of birds.
   The condors displayed Tuesday will be released in January, along
with a fourth bird that had not yet arrived.
   Scientists hope that once released, the birds will stay in the
sanctuary and away from areas where wild California condors died
from what officials believe was lead poisoning. They were poisoned
by eating the carcasses of coyotes that were trapped and shot, or
the remains of wounded deer that died after escaping hunters,
scientists said.
   Wallace said others probably were shot, and some may have been
killed by colliding with power lines.
   Development along California's coast and San Joaquin Valley also
gradually destroyed much condor habitat, researchers believe.
   So far, only one California condor chick has been hatched in
captivity. That is the seven-month-old Moloko, who resides at the
San Diego Wild Animal Park. Dowhan hopes one to five more chicks
will hatch next year.
   Four of the last five wild breeding pairs of California condors
vanished in 1984-1985. In 1986, the Fish and Wildlife Service made a
controversial decision to round up the last six wild birds to
prevent their demise.
   So far, attempts to save the condors have cost about $20 million.

   A California condor chick, inspired by
recordings of vulture hisses and grunts, was slowly chipping its
way out of its shell today, San Diego Wild Animal Park officials
said.
   ``Everything is proceeding fine,'' park spokeswoman Martha Baker
said this morning. ``The chick is moving around inside the shell
and the condor keepers can hear the chick tapping.''
   ``What we're trying to do is provide a natural stimulus to the
bird to assist it in hatching,'' spokesman Tom Hanscom said
Wednesday.
   The chick, the first ever of the nearly extinct species to be
conceived in captivity, began its three-day struggle to break free
of its blue-green egg early Wednesday.
   A successful hatching would raise the population to 28. All 27
California condors are in captivity, 14 at the Wild Animal Park and
13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Baker said park officials still expect the chick to hatch Friday
or Saturday. If the chick hasn't emerged from its shell by 4 a.m.
Saturday, keepers likely will help it out, Hanscom said.
   Meanwhile, keepers are playing recordings of bird noises and
gently tapping the egg with a light metal rod every two hours to
simulate what condor parents would do to encourage the youth, he
said.
   The chick has settled into a rhythm of pecking and resting,
punctuated by cheeps, and appears to be strong and healthy, said
Bill Toone, curator of birds at the park.
   ``At this point, it will continue to push at the pip hole and
situate itself so that it will attempt to cap the egg,'' Hanscom
said, referring to the chick's chipping all the way around the egg
so it can push the upper third of the shell away from the rest.
   The egg is being watched on a remote television monitor but
keepers are reluctant to help the chick because of the danger that
blood vessels linked to a surrounding membrane will rupture, which
could cause fatal bleeding.
   Since 1983, there have been 14 successful condor hatchings at
the Wild Animal Park and the affiliated San Diego Zoo involving
eggs taken from the wild. All of those hatchings occurred with
human help, although one of those chicks died of an infection 24
hours after birth.
   The egg was laid March 3 at the park's ``condorminium'' after
its parents engaged in the first captive mating in the history of a
15-year program aimed at saving North America's largest land bird.
California condors, which are scavengers, have wing spans of up to
10 feet.
   State and federal wildlife officials overseeing the condor
program decided to remove the remaining condors in the wild to
focus efforts on a captive breeding flock. The last known
California condor in the wild was captured in April 1987.

   A California condor Thursday laid the first egg
ever produced in captivity by a pair of the endangered birds,
boosting efforts to save the species, the San Diego Wild Animal
Park said.
   If the egg hatches at the end of its two-month incubation, it
will be the first California condor ever conceived in captivity,
officials said. Only 27 of the birds exist, all in captivity, said
park spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   Biologists moved the egg from the nest to an incubator,
according to plan, Hanscom said. The egg may not produce an
offspring because the female is old and her mate, a young male, may
be sexually immature, park officials cautioned.
   By taking the egg from its parents at an early point, scientists
hope to induce the pair to ``double-clutch,'' or produce a second
egg to replace the lost one.
   California condors have been decimated in the wild by lead
poisoning, caused by eating lead shot in animal carcasses,
biologists said.
   The last California condor in the wild was captured and brought
to the Wild Animal Park on April 3, 1987 in a last bid to restore
the vanishing species.
   Fourteen of the birds are kept at the San Diego park in
enclosures not on view to the public. The 13 others are similarly
housed at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Since 1981, scientists have hatched 13 condors in captivity from
eggs taken in the wild. The birds, which have a wingspan of about 9
feet, are dark reddish-brown with a curved beak.

<HEAD>Condors Lay Egg At Los Angeles Zoo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After weeks of amorous but clumsy courting, a
female California condor laid an egg scientists hope will prove
fertile and produce a condor chick for the endangered species'
captive breeding program.
   The egg was noticed Monday after Los Angeles Zoo researchers
reviewed a videotape of activity in the condor's plywood nest box
and briefly saw it as the condors traded places from the nest to the
outside.
   The couple, a male condor named Cuyama and a female named
Cachuma, had piqued the interest of observers on Sunday when they
showed signs indicating an egg-laying was near.
   ``They were showing great interest in each other, nibbling each
other and following each other around to the nest box and scraping
around as though making a nest in the sand,'' said Mike Wallace,
curator of birds at the zoo and supervisor of its captive condor
breeding program.
   He said the egg was the first for the Los Angeles Zoo program. A
condor egg laid in captivity was hatched last year in the program at
the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   Only 28 of the endangered California condors remain alive, 14 in
captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo and 14 more in San Diego.
Scientists hope the vultures, which are North America's largest land
birds with 9{-foot wingspans, will reproduce enough so that some can
be returned to the wild in five to 10 years.
   The breeding program has removed all known California condors
from the wild. Environmentalists have complained that other captive
breeding programs have met with only limited success.
   The egg will be removed from the nest and placed in incubation
sometime Wednesday, Wallace said. As part of the breeding program,
scientists hope to have the birds produce as many as three
fertilized eggs during the January to April mating season.
   ``If you remove the first egg as soon as it's laid, they will
recycle and go into another mating ritual, and within 30 days lay
another egg,'' he explained.
   Experts will know in seven to 10 days whether the egg placed in
the incubator is fertilized, Wallace said. If it is, the chick
should hatch in 55 to 66 days.
   Cuyama and Cachuma, both 6 years old and new to the courting
ritual, have shown an interest in each other for the past few weeks,
with Cuyama waltzing around Cachuma with outstretched wings, Wallace
said.
   ``We had seen attempts on (Cuyama's) part to copulate, but they
were not good ones because it's his first time and he's learning
how,'' Wallace said.
   The other six condor couples at the zoo also have been in
courtship over the past week.

   A fist-sized bundle of fluff named Molloko, the
first California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled meals
of minced mice today.
   ``Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the chick,''
said Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
``But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or
animal.''
   The chick ate its first meal about 6 a.m. and took subsequent
meals from the fingertips of a keeper, Ms. Baker said.
   The food was minced baby mice and chicken egg yoke, she said.
The meals fed to the chick, which is about the size of a man's
fist, amounted to about two tablespoons of food.
   Keepers using tweezers and gloved fingertips helped the baby
bird break free of its shell at 5:38 p.m. PDT Friday ending a
61{-hour hatching process that began when the first crack appeared
in the chick's shell Wednesday.
   Molloko is an Indian word for condor, chosen by an intertribal
council of California tribes, Ms. Baker said.
   The squawking chick was swaddled in a towel and placed in the
same type of isolette used for premature infants. The dull
yellow-colored chick with its bald, peaked head, was reportedly
resting comfortably.
   ``Early this morning there were 27 California condors left in
the world,'' Bill Toone, the park's curator of birds, said at the
news conference Friday. ``This afternoon there's 28 of them, and we
couldn't be more excited about that.
   ``When the numbers are so low, one bird is seen as a very big
step away from extinction,'' he added.
   The chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair
of the nearly extinct California condor, North America's largest
land bird.
   Efforts to save the California condor, which has a wingspan of
up to 10 feet at maturity, rest with the captive breeding program.
The last known California condor in the wild was captured a year
ago.
   The chick, whose sex won't be determined for about a month, will
grow up not knowing its mother or father. It will be raised in
captivity with the help of hand puppets that resemble condors. The
puppets are used to feed the chick.
   Officials decided to intervene in the hatching process Friday
and give the chick a delicate boost after it became mired inside
its shell.
   The bird had become stuck in a kind of ``glue'' composed of
dried membrane and albumen and couldn't rotate in the shell to peck
its way out, Hanscom said.
   Biologist Cyndi Kuehler checked the egg every two hours Friday
before determining the chick was ready to be assisted from the
shell.
   Kuehler couldn't intervene prematurely because of the danger of
rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes, possibly
triggering fatal bleeding at the point of the rupture, Hanscom said.
   When it was certain that the chick's external circulation
ceased, Kuehler could begin to pull away bits of the blue-green
eggshell using her gloved fingers. Tweezers were used to peel back
the shell membrane. The gradual, complicated process took seven
hours until there was room to lift the bird out.
   The avocado-sized egg, about 5 inches long, had been under a
24-hour watch since 4 a.m. Wednesday, when keepers noticed cracks
in one end. The ``pip'' cracks signaled the start of a hatching
process that took nearly three days.
   After the egg was laid March 3, it was taken away from the
parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female
bird would produce a second egg. But so far, this has not happened.

COMMON MOORHEN 
</P>
<P>
(Gallinula chloropus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Black head and neck, with red forehead shield, red bill with 
yellow tip. Back is brownish-olive; underparts slate; white streaking on flanks 
shows as a thin white line. 
</P>
<P>
Legs and feet are yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Found in fresh-water marshes, lakes and ponds, usually with emergent 
vegetation and grassy edges. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly aquatic vegetation; also mollusks (especially snails), worms; 
berries, fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: With head low, wings partly raised and open, elevates tail exposing 
white undertail feathers. Male bends head down and in toward feet; male and 
female bow. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually over water (with ramps leading down to water), occasionally on 
ground or in low shrub. Occasionally unused nests, brooding and roosting 
platforms nearby and old nests of jays and magpies. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Cinnamon/buff, marked with reddish-brown or olive colors. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: These birds are cooperative breeders with young of first 
brood, often aiding in care of subsequent broods and in defense of territory. 
Younger birds lay smaller clutches than older birds and lay later. Young 
usually hatch asynchronously. Wing spur aids young in climbing. (The Common 
moorhen was once called the Common Gallinule.)

TWO ENDANGERED
BIRDS TO LEAVE ZOO IN PREPARATION FOR RELEASE INTO
WILD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Next year we're hoping for four to six birds to go out," Wallace said. "In
four years or so, we're looking at having 15 to 20 birds out each year.";  
The last wild California condor -- designated AC-9, for adult condor 9 -- was
captured four years ago after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided the
only hope for saving the endangered giant birds was to breed them in captivity
to build a population for reintroduction into the wild.;   52 in captivity;
There are now 52 California condors in captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo and
the San Diego Wild Animal Park in Escondido, up from 27 when AC-9 was captured
in 1987.;   Condors once soared across North America, but their numbers
dwindled as they fell victim to lead poisoning from hunters' bullets and from
eating game that had been shot with lead ammunition.;   Two young California
condors will take the first step toward the wild Thursday when they are
removed from the Los Angeles Zoo and placed in a large enclosure on a rugged
cliff top in the Los Padres National Forest's Sespe Mountains.;   The area is
just north of Fillmore and about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.; 
 To soar in January; The California condors -- and two rare Andean condors
also held at the zoo -- will remain in the pen atop the cliff until January.; 
 They will be released to fly above the wilderness of the Sespe Condor Refuge,
said Robert Mesta, condor program coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife
Service in Ventura.;   Scientists previously freed six Andean condors to test
methods for releasing California condors.;   Wallace said releasing the first
two California condors is "an important milestone," but the success of the
Condor Recovery Project won't be known for about six years, when freed condors
should start breeding in the wild.;   As the Sespe Condor Refuge's condor
population grows during the next few years, biologists will begin preparing a
second condor habitat, possibly in the Grand Canyon, where California condors
once flourished, Wallace said.;   About $25 million has been spent on the
effort to save California condors, including the cost of buying land in the
Sespe sanctuary, Mesta said.;   The first two birds to be released are named
Xewe, which means "To Cast a Shadow" in a California Indian language, and
Chocuyens, which means "Valley of the Moon."  </TEXT>

OIL SPILL DRAWS A FLOCK OF POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This foul glaze of crude oil sloshing over California's coastal waters 
threatens the birds, enrages the surfers, worries the beach dwellers, raises 
hell in the petroleum company board rooms . . . and, of course, sounds the call 
to action for California's election-minded politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Disasters always have a pull on politicos, even though such events can be risky 
propositions. Ridicule awaits those too eager to capitalize on someone else's 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not the case Thursday as officeholders lined up on the sands of 
Huntington Beach -- or via broadcast news hookups -- to decry this grim mix of 
oil and water on a sunny winter day. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps politicians seemed comfortable here at the scene because of 
California's bipartisan and seemingly hardening political consensus that the 
state is ill-protected from these kinds of crude disasters. Or maybe it was 
because oil spills, made by humans, are within the power of humans to control, 
if only with the right leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation of the last 24 hours demonstrates conclusively that we have to 
do something, and we have to do it quickly," said candidate for governor John 
K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat and California's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp stood in the sand with the tanker American Trader wallowing off in 
the hazy background with its frantic circle of tenders. A wooden State of 
California podium had been dragged onto the beach to add an official feel to 
the scene. But Van de Kamp followed political etiquette as to dressing down for 
disaster -- arriving in tennis shoes, gray slacks and a bright green cable-knit 
sweater, rather than a politician's suit and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis likewise stood at the podium wearing a sweater -- blue. 
</P>
<P>
Across the continent, Republican candidate for governor and U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson joined the Democrats in outrage via a pre-dawn television interview 
beamed home from Washington. He chose burgundy for his sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get the sweater memo," laughed Republican candidate for lieutenant 
governor John Seymour, a state senator from Anaheim. He showed up on the beach 
in coat and tie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wasn't all bad, though. Most of the media don't know me by sight. The 
fact that I had a tie on identified me -- they said, 'Hey, that guy has got to 
be a politician or somebody.' So I probably got more coverage this way." 
</P>
<P>
Leo T. McCarthy, the Democrat who is seeking a third term as lieutenant 
governor, showed up also in coat and tie. He was prepared to take off his 
jacket and go shirt-sleeved. "But I looked and I had a huge tear in my shirt, 
so I had to keep my coat on," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
The spill had barely begun before experts predicted that it would prod 
non-believers into action on new oil spill legislation in Congress and the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the more ambitious of the state's political leaders did not hesitate 
to size up its potential spillover into the 1990 California election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp figured spectators would feel as helpless as the oil slopping about 
at the mercy of the breezes. He offered them a way to take action -- by signing 
petitions to qualify his "Big Green" environmental initiative for the November 
ballot. Among other things, the ballot proposition would establish tanker 
safety standards and impose a new tax on oil to create a $500-million cleanup 
superfund. 
</P>
<P>
"You can do something," he said to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Like other politicians, he also knew that reporters, dozens of them, and their 
score of satellite TV trucks, helicopters, cameras and sound booms, would be 
anxious, to say the least, for deeds to record. 
</P>
<P>
Hold up those petitions for the cameras, they asked him. Here, let us shoot you 
gathering signatures. Please, general, move over closer to the water. There. 
Thanks. No one seemed to mind that the attorney general stood behind a podium 
where the official state seal of Controller Davis was emblazoned. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour took credit for action establishing a center to treat oil-soaked bird 
and sea lions. Wilson re-emphasized his independence from the Bush 
Administration and renewed a call for the President to prohibit offshore oil 
drilling. He also exhorted Congress to act on requiring double-hulled tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and McCarthy spoke as two members of the State Lands Commission, which 
has responsibility for California tidelands. They urged support for state 
Legislation to prepare California for an even larger spill. 
</P>
<P>
They practiced their "sound bites" along the way. "This spill is a wake-up call 
for California," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, Lady Luck has smiled on California," said Davis, referring to the 
fair winds that held the slick offshore. ". . . No one, however, should confuse 
good luck with good planning." 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor Marian Bergeson, who represents 
the Orange County coast in the state Senate, joined the pilgrimage to the 
beach. She vowed to fight any further offshore oil drilling. She also sent a 
shot at rival Seymour for his votes in favor of coastal oil development. 
</P>
<P>
Local Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and C. Christopher Cox, joined by Rep. Mel Levine 
of Santa Monica, came as a delegation, arriving with a showy beachfront 
helicopter landing. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the spill scene were two California politicians of note. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, Democratic candidate for governor and former mayor of San 
Francisco, thought it would be unseemly to traipse onto the sand. "She doesn't 
hold an office; it's a little difficult for her to claim a platform to speak," 
said aide Dee Dee Myers. "There is nothing worse than standing on the beach 
with your thumbs in your suspenders waiting for someone to ask you a question." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian also stayed away, but probably for different reasons. He 
is California's foremost political champion of coastal oil development. "He 
feels the situation is being capably managed," said Press Secretary Bob Gore.

   Gov. George Deukmejian is urging
Californians to listen to their mothers.
   The governor joined Jackie Stallone and Georgia Holt, the
mothers of actors Sylvester Stallone and Cher, in kicking off a
campaign on Tuesday to promote ride sharing and van-pool programs
to help unclog freeways.
   But he was a little late because of traffic congestion.
   The campaign will feature the theme of rather universal motherly
sayings. One advertisement depicts a woman who says: ``We're not
the first one to try to talk some sense into you about sharing.''
   Other celebrity moms taking part include Laurie Williams, mother
of comic Robin Williams, and Christine Johnson, mother of Los
Angeles Lakers basketball star Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson.
   ``Your mother, as this (campaign) says, always told you to share
and it was good advice then and I think it's very good advice now,
and it's going to help us to meet our transportation challenges,''
Deukmejian said.
   Deukmejian said California is the sixth-largest economic power
in the world but each day workers lose about 400,000 hours of
productivity while stuck in traffic.
   Last year, 22.4 million vehicles were in the state and there
will be 23.8 million by the century's end. There is an average of
1.2 persons per vehicle in peak hours, but congestion could be
eliminated if that improved to just 1.4 per vehicle, Deukmejian
said.

   State Sen. Bob Swain got little attention
when he introduced a bill to designate an official state dog, but
now the ``Plott'' has thickened.
   The Senate Rules Committee quickly endorsed the bill to make the
Plott hound North Carolina's official dog. Lucy, a 10-year-old
Plott owned by former Rep. Hugh Lee, wagged her tail in silent
approval.
   ``All other breeds pale in comparison,'' said Swain, a Democrat
who said the hound is the only dog indigenous to North Carolina.
It's a favorite of mountain bear hunters, he said.
   ``It's the only dog I think would be proper for a state dog,''
Lee told reporters after the meeting Tuesday.
   ``You talk about a Plott, you're talking about the Kit Carsons,
the Davy Crocketts and the Daniel Boones of the dog world,'' Lee
said. ``They were frontier people, they went out hunting and lived
by their instincts ... and they were from western North Carolina.''
   The Plott hound is a descendant of a German breed used for boar
hunting, Swain said. An immigrant named Jonathan Plott brought it
to North Carolina in the mid-1700s.
   The Plott hound is an officially registered breed, Swain said.
The typical Plott has brown-black coloring and weighs about 75
pounds.
   ``I think without any question it has all the qualities of a
good North Carolinian,'' Swain said. ``He's loyal, he is fearless,
he has perseverance.''
   The Rules Committee approved Swain's bill without dissent. It
now goes to the Senate floor.

   The Missouri Senate passed a bill
making the 250-million-year-old remains of a plantlike animal the
official state fossil.
   But some senators objected to spending time on the matter with a
May 12 adjournment and several major bills pending.
   ``Is it any coincidence that you are trying to make the state
fossil a spineless animal?'' Sen. Jay Nixon asked Tuesday. ``What's
next? Perhaps the bat will be the state bird because it's blind.''
   The state bird is the bluebird.
   Nixon said the crinoid fossil bill ``reflects the quality of
legislation so far this session.'' He said he was concerned the
headlines would read, ``Senate spends afternoon making spineless
wimp the state fossil.''
   But the bill's sponsor, Sen. Robert Johnson, called the measure
an important civics lesson for an eighth-grade science class in his
district that first proposed it.
   ``Now they've seen an idea from their classroom go through both
chambers for a possible signing by the governor,'' he said.
   Crinoids, commonly known as sea lillies, flourished 250 million
years ago when most of Missouri was covered by shallow seas. They
are found throughout the state, mainly in limestone deposits.

   Three female Andean
condors are alive, well and eating rodents fed to them by their
hand puppet ``parents'' in preparation for their eventual release
into the wild, animal biologists said.
   The three young birds, ranging in age from 3 to 5 months, were
transported last week to a wilderness site in rural Ventura County.
They are part of an experiment to test methods that researchers
plan to use when they release a group of endangered California
condors into the wild in the 1990s.
   The Andean condors are listed as endangered, but there are
thousands of them, while there are only 28 California condors. The
California condors all are in zoos in Los Angeles and San Diego as
part of a breeding program to reintroduce the species into the wild.
   The three Andean condors are beginning to adjust to life in a
cliffside cave north of Fillmore, said Los Angeles Zoo biologist
Mike Wallace, who is in charge of the release program.
   By early December, the birds will likely begin to fly and hunt
their own food, Wallace said Friday.
   The largest bird was apparently homesick and welcomed a visit in
her enclosure from her puppet ``mother.'' Two of the three Andean
condors were raised by human hand puppets.
   ``If you can imagine a 17-pound bird just bouncing all over the
place and grunting for attention _ it was way too much for one arm
with a puppet on it to handle,'' Wallace said.
   The bird raised by real condor parents has kept her distance
from the others and ardently protects her territory, Wallace said.
But she is eating from the puppets nonetheless.
   A fourth Andean condor died, apparently of shock, en route to
the Ventura County site last week.

   The oil spill threatening
California's coast pales in comparison with the offshore oil well
blowout that fouled Santa Barbara beaches in 1969 and helped create
the environmental movement.
   Crews toiled Thursday to clean up more than 290,000 gallons of
oil that hovered off the Southern California city of Huntington
Beach after being spilled Wednesday by the tanker American Trader.
   Estimates go as high as 3.25 million gallons for the spill Jan.
28, 1969, that resulted from failure of a well casing on a Union
Oil Co. of California platform 5{ miles off Santa Barbara.
   Perhaps more significant, industry experts and environmentalists
alike have said public concern for the environment was focused by
nationally televised scenes of birds and beaches drenched with
sticky black goo. The spill spurred an eight-year drilling
moratorium off Santa Barbara.
   The blowout ``spewed more than 3.25 million gallons of oil over
800 square miles of water, covered 100 miles of coastline and
beaches with a thick, tarry black goo, smothered thousands of
birds, fish and other sea life, and helped trigger a new age of
environmental awareness,'' the California Coastal Commission said
on the spill's 20th anniversary.
   Even two decades after the Santa Barbara spill, Union Oil _ now
renamed Unocal Corp. _ claimed that, at most, 840,000 gallons
spilled. But the Western States Petroleum Association has said at
least 2.1 million gallons spilled.
   The spill killed at least 9,000 birds, 8.8 million barnacles,
30,000 mussels and 51,800 limpets, but harm to the fishing industry
wasn't proved, according to tallies by biologist Michael Neushul of
the University of California, Santa Barbara.
   Unocal, which ended up paying about $16 million to settle
spill-related lawsuits, has argued the spill wasn't an ecological
disaster, and that it spurred improvements in drilling technology
and training of workers on drilling platforms.
   Environmentalists contend oil still leaks from the spill site,
but Unocal blames natural oil seepage from the ocean floor.

   The accidental release of at least
175,000 gallons of a particularly gooey form of crude oil has
turned from a minor inconvenience into a major menace to fragile
bird rookeries and a major sports fishing industry.
   ``This is a sin, a crime against God's creation, and makes a
city boy want to cry,'' said Joseph Hallachi, 43, of Santa Cruz,
who drove 120 miles to voluntarily help state crews remove oil from
a city park shoreline.
   The April 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small
animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects.
   The spill of San Joaquin crude from Shell Oil Co.'s major
Northern California refinery occurred after a broken storm drain
pipe running through the middle of an oil tank allowed crude to be
siphoned out. The company's practice of keeping valves open during
storms was a violation of federal environmental regulations.
   It has been a frustrating week for dozens of volunteers trying
to care for dying wildlife and for cleanup workers struggling to
remove the tarry muck.
   They have been busy along a 15-mile stretch of waterway from the
Carquinez Strait to the mouth of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
with their major sport fishing industry, and at Peyton Slough marsh
and Ryer Island, critical wildlife habitat for the endangered
clapper rail and dozens of other bird species, including various
ducks, blue heron, black rail and California brown pelican.
   ``This is the worst possible thing that can happy to a pretty
place like this,'' said Sheri Banks, 21, a member of the California
Conservation Corps, a state job skills training program, who helped
gather up oil.
   ``It'll never be the same. I don't think a man's hands can clean
all this up,'' added fellow corps member Steven Reed, 19, rubbing
his gloves on yellow protective coveralls nearly black below the
chest.
   ``Shell Oil people should be the ones forced to come down here
and clean these rocks themselves,'' he said.
   Those sentiments are echoed by city residents, by state
officials who blasted Shell for violating federal regulations and
environmentalists who fear for the future of California's dwindling
wetlands, where many shore and water creatures breed and reproduce.
   ``There's a lot of dismay by almost everybody who lives here,''
said Jack Garner, city manager of Martinez, population 30,000.
Except for Shell's administration building, loading dock and wharf,
the 1,000-acre refinery is outside city limits, and thus beyond
city regulation.
   At a state hearing at Martinez City Hall on the spill Friday,
Garner predicted ``there'll be an awful lot of anger, an awful lot
of frustration, and an awful lot of anxiety about our future in the
company's shadow.
   ``Up to this point, there's never been such a graphic physical
illustration of what the worst-case scenario with that plant could
be.''
   Local boat owners, many of whom make a living by taking sports
fishermen into the delta, fear the oil will harm the estuary's
delicate food chain and possibly deplete fish stocks already
reduced by decades of water quality problems in the delta.
   Most of the 400 boats at the city's marina still had oil on
their hulls this weekend; under federal regulations, they can't
leave docks until they are cleaned. Shell promised to pick up the
tab.
   The San Francisco Bay area's largest yacht race of the year was
canceled Saturday because oil was still in Vallejo's harbor.
Patrick Lane, vice commodore of the sponsoring Vallejo Yacht Club,
said Shell officials asked for the cancellation, preferring to
reimburse the club's losses of up to $60,000 rather than possibly
being liable for cleaning boats. About 700 boat owners had paid
entry fees.
   Harbormaster Barry Wysling closed the marina until all oil
sheens are removed from the strait and delta. That prevented dozens
of ocean fishermen from participating in Sunday's opening of the
salmon season.
   Environmentalists are concerned over the effects of oil in the
marshes.
   ``The marshes are devastated ... and there are toxins in that
oil that is seeping into the environment every day,'' said Neal
Welsh, a biologist and vice president of Mount Diablo Audubon
Society.
   ``It's going to take a Herculean effort to return it to its
natural state,'' he added. ``If they leave it alone, it will take
decades to return of its own accord.''
   Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey said the company will ``pay
whatever it costs'' to restore the damaged marshes.
   ``These wetlands and estuaries are the cradle of the oceans,
where they get energy and nutrients,'' said Welsh. ``We're not
insisting on saving them just for aesthetics and recreation. We're
talking about saving life itself.''

   Molloko, the California condor chick, took its
first meal from its ``mother,'' a hand puppet built to resemble an
adult condor.
   ``We introduced mom puppet to baby today. They hit it off
fine,'' San Diego Wild Animal Park spokesman Tom Hanscom said
Wednesday.
   The previous feedings of Molloko, the first captive-bred condor
in the history of the critically endangered species, were delivered
by hand.
   Condor keeper Beckie Usnik operated the puppet to feed as well
as preen Molloko. Officials use the puppet to eliminate human
contact and prevent the chick from ``bonding'' with its keepers.
   The chick, which hatched Friday with human help, has been eating
well, consuming about 15 ``pinkies,'' chopped baby mice, during
feedings spaced about two hours apart.
   Hanscom said the chick weighs 9.45 ounces, up from its hatching
weight of 6.75 ounces.
   The hatching of Molloko raised the California condor population
to 28. All of the rare birds are in captivity _ 15 at the Wild
Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The species' future rests with efforts to breed the bird in
captivity.

<HEAD>Andean Condor Dies En Route to Wilderness Experiment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of four Andean condors en route to a
wilderness area for an experiment on how to reintroduce endangered
California condors into the wild died Saturday.
   The other three zoo-bred Andean condors were safely placed in
secret holding pens in Los Padres National Forest, and more will be
brought to the area in October, said Joe Dowhan of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.
   ``This was a real shock, especially because the first three
birds came through well,'' said Dowhan. ``But except for everybody
being down right now, it has very little effect on the program.''
   The Andean birds, all female, are being used to test techniques
biologists hope to use to begin returning the California condor to
nature.
   The Andean condor was chosen because it's the closest relative
to the California condor. The Andean condors also are endangered
but they number in the thousands.
   Scientists are doing the experiment to see how birds hatched in
captivity adapt to freedom, fending for themselves in a region
without native birds of their species as role models.
   The four Andean condors were transported in airline-style animal
shipping crates.
   Two came from the San Diego Wild Animal Park. One was from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent, Md., and the one
that died came from the Los Angeles Zoo, Dowhan said.
   ``We're not sure why this particular bird died. We discovered it
died just before we released it. So it happened somewhere in
transit,'' said Dowhan.
   The 3- and 4-month-old birds will spend several weeks in mesh
enclosures in the forest 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Scientists will prepare them for their first flights over the
dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large population
of California condors, but whose numbers have dwindled to 28, all
in captivity.
   When the Andean birds are able to fly, sometime in November,
scientists will fit them with radio monitoring gear, release them,
and monitor their progress.
