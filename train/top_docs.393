<TEXT>     As many as several thousand Americans may suffer from a little-known
neurological disorder called "alien hand syndrome," in which their left hands
literally don't know what their right hands are doing, said neurologist
Rachelle Doody of Baylor University in Houston. Doody discussed the syndrome
Wednesday at a Boston meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.;    In the
least severe forms of the syndrome, one of the patient's hands may flop about
aimlessly.;    In more severe cases, it may try to do the same things the
opposite hand is doing or attempt to counter them. In the worst cases, the
hand may become aggressive, pinching, slapping or punching the patient -- and
in at least one recorded case even trying to strangle its owner.;    The
syndrome appears to be caused by damage to certain areas of the brain and is
often temporary, disappearing a few months after the damage occurs. It can be
reproduced in animals by damaging the same areas of the brain.;    There is no
treatment for the syndrome, but those animal studies suggest that it
eventually may be possible to develop surgical techniques to minimize the
symptoms, Doody said.;    The disorder can be frightening for patients, said
neurologist Ramone Leiguarda of the Institute for Neurological Research in
Buenos Aires, Argentina. Leiguarda recounted a written description of the
disorder by what he termed a "typical patient.";    "I was traveling on a
bus," the patient wrote, "when I noticed a hand approaching me from the right
from behind and trying to catch me. After grasping my trouser leg, the hand
would not release it. At first I thought somebody was robbing me, but then I
realized it was my own right hand. . . . I couldn't sleep at all that night
because I was terrified my abnormal hand would assault me while I was
sleeping.";    Usually the symptoms are not so dramatic, but they are
disconcerting nonetheless. In all cases, Doody said, the affected limb feels
foreign or alien to the patient, as though it is not part of the same body.;  
 Often, the affected hand will mirror what the normal hand is doing.;    "If
the right hand goes to do something, the left hand tries to beat it," Doody
said. This can make it difficult, for example, to dial a telephone.;    But
more often, the affected hand will try to do the opposite of what the normal
hand is doing, Leiguarda said.;    "If a person is trying to button a shirt
with one hand, the other hand will follow along and undo the buttons," he
said. "If one hand opens a book, the other will shut it. If one hand pulls up
trousers, the other will pull them down.";    Neurologists are not sure of the
precise mechanism by which the phenomenon operates, but it can be caused by
strokes, degenerative diseases or anything that causes damage to certain areas
of the brain, especially the thalamus, which coordinates sensory perceptions,
and the corpus callosum, which connects the two spheres of the brain.;   
Leiguarda said the syndrome is a frequent complication when surgery is
performed on the corpus callosum to alleviate severe epileptic symptoms.;   
Usually the phenomenon disappears in a few weeks to a few months after the
brain reorganizes itself to bypass the damage, Leiguarda said. "Usually, but
not always," he added.;    Doody has never seen "Dr. Strangelove," and
Leiguarda has not heard of it. But Leiguarda noted that he had been searching
through history and mythology without success to find a name for the disorder.
"Perhaps the 'Strangelove Syndrome' is not such a bad name," he mused.  </TEXT>

   Justices Tighten
   Rules for Appeals
   From Death Row

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court made it tougher for
convicted criminals, especially those on death row, to file
repeated challenges to the constitutionality of their
convictions.
   By a 6-3 vote, the high court ruled that a Georgia inmate,
Warren McCleskey, convicted in 1978 of a murder the same
year, abused the legal process known as habeas corpus by
filing a second round of legal challenges to his conviction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A petition for habeas corpus is a civil action by a state
or federal prisoner normally filed after the prisoner has
been convicted and has had that conviction upheld on appeal.
The habeas corpus petition goes beyond asserting that
evidence didn't support a conviction and attacks the
constitutionality of any number of police, lawyer or judicial
practices that allegedly violated the defendant's rights.
   Conservatives on the court, in Congress and in the
executive branch have complained for years that prisoners and
their lawyers are dragging out death sentences by filing a
succession of habeas corpus petitions that rehash old issues
or raise new ones that could have been raised earlier. Both
the Bush administration and some lawmakers have proposed
legislation to limit the number of habeas petitions and the
length of time for filing them in death penalty cases.
   Yesterday, in a decision written by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, the court set a legal standard that will make it
significantly harder for prisoners to file more than one
petition for habeas corpus. The decision prompted a strong
dissent by Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justices
Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.
   The high court ruled that when a prisoner files a second
habeas corpus petition in federal court, the prosecutor must
document which legal claims are being raised for the first
time. The prisoner must then provide good reasons why the
issues, such as interference by law enforcement officers or
unavailability of factual or legal information, weren't
raised in the first petition. The prisoners also must show
that the case was actually prejudiced by the alleged
constitutional violations.
   In McCleskey's case, rather than allowing a lower federal
court to apply this new standard, the court ruled that
McCleskey's second petition was an abuse of habeas corpus.
(McCleskey vs. Zant)
                                                                                                       

   Attorney's Fees
                                                                                                       

   By a 9-0 vote, the justices ruled that a lawyer who
represents himself in a civil rights case can't take
advantage of the federal law that allows successful parties
in civil rights lawsuits to collect their attorneys fees from
the losers. The decision, written by Justice Stevens, was a
defeat for a lawyer who successfully challenged a Kentucky
law that kept his name off the 1980 Democratic presidential
primary ballot. (Kay vs. Ehrler)

   Supreme Court Conservatives Play Role
   Of Legislators on Death Penalty Issue

   WASHINGTON -- It has long been a hallmark of Supreme Court
conservatives to complain that their liberal colleagues are
acting more like legislators passing laws than justices
interpreting them.
   Last week, the roles were reversed. Apparently impatient
with the slow pace of congressional efforts to truncate the
system of appeals in death-penalty cases, the court's
conservative majority decided not to wait any longer and did
it themselves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This departure from the traditional conservative approach
was vividly highlighted when the Senate Judiciary Committee,
just two days after the court's ruling, held its first
hearing of the year on proposed crime legislation. Among the
proposals by the Bush administration is one that would do
what the court in effect has already donelimit the number of
death-penalty appeals.
   The controversy is over the centuries-old system of
federal habeas corpus, a civil lawsuit generally filed by a
prison inmate who has been convicted and who has had his
conviction upheld on appeal. A state prisoner files a habeas
corpus petition first in state court and then federal court
to argue that his constitutional rights were violated by
police or prosecutors or trial judges.
   Conservatives, led by Chief Justice Rehnquist on the court
and by state and federal law-enforcement officials elsewhere,
have long maintained that in deathpenalty cases, the habeas
corpus system has been badly abused by prisoners and their
lawyers who file one petition after another, raising new and
old legal issues, and delaying executions for years.
   "The resulting lack of finality undermines public
confidence in our criminal justice system," said the 1989
report of a task force appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist
and headed by retired Justice Lewis Powell.
   The Powell report recommended time limits on filing habeas
corpus petitions and would have made it difficult to file
more than once. It formed the basis for legislation proposed
by the Bush administration and its allies in the last
Congress. Indeed, Chief Justice Rehnquist caused a stir by
sending the Powell report to Congress before the Judicial
Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal courts, had
a chance to vote on it.
   But liberals, while acknowledging the need to clear up
post-conviction appeals, opposed the Powell recommendations
as far too restrictive of habeas corpus, which is virtually
the only way a convicted prisoner has to protect against
law-enforcement abuses. The result was that the House and
Senate passed different versions of habeas corpus
legislation. Both were dropped from the final bill last year,
and action was put over for the new Congress this year.
   The Supreme Court, however, chose not to wait. By a 6-3
vote, the justices adopted a new legal standard for reviewing
second and subsequent habeas corpus petitions that will
virtually eliminate them, except in the most extraordinary
cases.
   "This is an attempt to do through court decision what they
haven't been able to do through legislative action," said
John Boger, a University of North Carolina law professor and
experienced appellate lawyer in capital cases. Mr. Boger
represented Warren McCleskey, the Georgia prisoner in the
Supreme Court case.
   The new legal standard puts the burden on the prisoner to
prove that there is good reason the habeas corpus claim in a
second petition wasn't raised in the first petition. Even
then, the prisoner must show that the trial was prejudiced by
the allegedly improper action by police and prosecutors that
is the basis of the petition.
   It is a very tough standard to meet and goes beyond what
Georgia prosecutors sought in their brief in the McCleskey
case.
   The Bush administration apparently doesn't think it goes
far enough, however. President Bush's new crime bill proposes
a new standard for first-time federal habeas corpus petitions
in death cases that an American Bar Association briefing
paper says "would virtually eliminate the federal courts'
authority" to rule once the issues have been considered in
state court.
   Ironically, this proposal goes too far even for Chief
Justice Rehnquist. Although he helped ignite the present
furor for limits on habeas corpus, last May he criticized the
approach that is now at the heart of the president's crime
bill.

   Ending Abuse of Death Penalty Appeals

   These days, a sentence to death is more like a sentence to
a decade on death row. The average capital case takes 106
months from crime to execution, a committee headed by former
Justice William Lewis F. Powell Jr. reported in a study
issued last September.
   The investigation of the crime, the trial and sentencing,
the direct appeal to the highest court in the state followed
by a bid for U.S. Supreme Court review -- all this accounts
for only 48 of the 106 months. Most of the remaining time
goes to fashioning, presenting and litigating petitions for
habeas corpus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Inmates in state prisons can file their petitions in both
state and federal court. But state courts tend to give the
petitions short shrift, especially second and third petitions
after the first has been denied. The major delaying factor in
death cases, accounting for more than 80% of the average time
capital inmates spend on habeas corpus, is the federal writ.
There are no time deadlines for habeas corpus. The typical
"deadline" in capital cases is a looming execution date,
which usually sets off a new round of writs.
   This ability to spend years in the federal court system
long after a conviction has become final is a bonanza of the
Earl Warren era. In 1963, the Supreme Court handed down two
important rulings that opened the floodgates for writ
petitions from state prisoners. The first relaxed a
once-ironclad rule that required them to exhaust state-court
remedies first. The second allowed prisoners to raise
constitutional issues piecemeal over a series of writs,
trying out some issues in the first writ, others later. The
only bar is "abuse of the writ," deliberately holding back a
claim in order to manipulate the legal system.
   Few death row prisoners are executed these days without
having made at least two trips to the Supreme Court on
federal habeas corpus writs. Few prisoners are executed,
period. Since 1976, when the Supreme Court reapproved the
death penalty in a Georgia case, there have been only 124
executions. Most of the rest of the total U.S. death row
population of more than 2,327 is in court. In Georgia,
prosecutors and defense lawyers are still litigating
execution cases dating from 1974, when its new death law went
into effect.
   This has led to calls for reform in the federal habeas
system. Next week the Senate is scheduled to hear two
separate and competing reform packages by Senate Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden and ranking Republican Strom Thurmond.
Both packages would set time deadlines -- strict in the
Thurmond bill, less so in the Biden bill -- for filing writ
petitions. In the House, the Judiciary Committee's courts
subcommittee plans to start hearings Wednesday on habeas
corpus.
   But congressional reforms may not be necessary. In fact,
if Congress passes the Biden bill, the effect may well be to
sabotage the gradual course of federal habeas corpus reform
that the Supreme Court has undertaken on its own starting
when Warren Burger replaced Earl Warren, and accelerating
since William Rehnquist succeeded Mr. Burger.
   The court has removed entire congeries of legal issues,
such as those pertaining to the legality of state search
warrants from federal habeas corpus purview. In a doctrine
called "procedural default," the justices have refused to let
federal courts review questions that the defendant's lawyers
did not raise properly at earlier stages in the proceedings.
   In February 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a sleeper
decision, Teague v. Lane, holding that state prisoners could
not use federal habeas corpus as a vehicle for making new
constitutional law unless the proposed new rule (with some
exceptions), pertained to "bedrock" constitutional rights,
presumably on the order of the right to counsel. The ruling
effectively told state inmates to raise such claims in state
court on direct appeal or forget about them.
   On March 5 of this year, the justices issued two more
rulings extending Teague v. Lane to capital cases. Two other
death cases with Teague issues were argued in February and
April and are awaiting decision.
   The seemingly endless case of Robert Alton Harris, set for
argument Monday before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
is a case study in the way the current open-ended
post-conviction review system works in capital cases. Mr.
Harris was tried and sentenced to death in 1979 for the
murder of two teen-age boys at Miramar Lake near San Diego in
July 1978. In 1981, the California Supreme Court affirmed his
conviction and sentence -- one of only four such affirmations
during the tenure of liberal Chief Justice Rose Bird.
   The gruesome details of the murders and of Mr. Harris's
criminal career in general -- the eight shots he plugged into
the boys before finishing off the hamburgers they had been
eating, the fact that he was already on parole for beating a
neighbor to death and trying to set him afire, the forcible
sodomy he committed on a fellow inmate while awaiting trial
-- can be read in the California high court's 1981 opinion.
Suffice it to say that Mr. Harris's wife testified for the
prosecution at his sentencing hearing.
   During the 11 years since his conviction, Mr. Harris and
his lawyers have filed seven petitions for habeas corpus,
four in state court, three in federal court. Over the years
he has alleged: that his sentence was out of proportion to
his crimes; that the trial judge refused to give a
"diminished capacity" instruction to the jury based on Mr.
Harris's smoking two joints of marijuana before the murders;
that, although Mr. Harris is white, he was the victim of a
racially discriminatory capital sentencing system in
California. He won some court victories that higher courts
later reversed. By the end of last year, it seemed he had
exhausted all possible avenues of legal relief. An April 3
execution date was set. He was to be the first criminal to go
to the gas chamber in California since 1967.
   Just a week before Mr. Harris's scheduled execution date,
his attorneys filed the seventh and latest petition, winning
a stay of execution. The grounds for the newest writ? Two
court-appointed psychiatrists who examined Mr. Harris before
the sentencing hearing failed to discern any signs of organic
brain damage. His lawyers now say that Mr. Harris was a
victim of fetal alcohol syndrome, hyperactivity and other
brain disorders.
   In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a defendant
facing a death sentence has a right of access to the services
of a "competent" court-appointed psychiatrist. So why didn't
Mr. Harris raise this ground in 1985 or earlier rather than
on the eve of his execution in 1990? "We've been trying to
get the court to pay for an EEG since 1982, but the court
refused," is the response of Mr. Harris's lead lawyer,
Charles Sevilla. "Finally last year, we paid for one
ourselves."
   The issue of Mr. Harris's mental state now and in 1978 is
murky. He raised an alibi defense at trial and a marijuana
intoxication defense sometime later in the writ process. An
electroencephalogram administered to him before the 1979
sentencing hearing yielded normal results, although a 1971
EEG had shown abnormalities a probation officer attributed to
chronic glue-sniffing. At any rate, the murders, which
occurred so Mr. Harris and his brother could obtain a getaway
car for a bank robbery they had planned and rehearsed for
weeks, did not exactly bespeak a disordered brain.
   The Harris case has all the earmarks of a candidate for
quick termination under Teague v. Lane: an attempt to
establish a new rule of law via federal habeas corpus long
after the time for direct appeal has expired. That is where
the Biden bill would come into play. While setting a one-year
time limit at the end of direct appeal (subject to numerous
exceptions) for getting all federal habeas claims on file, it
also contains language that effectively overrides both Teague
v. Lane and the procedural default rule the Supreme Court set
earlier. The Biden bill is to the Supreme Court's recent
habeas corpus decisions what the pending Kennedy-Hawkins
civil rights bill is to its affirmative action rulings.
   Fortunately for prosecutors, the Biden bill has little
chance of passing, mostly because of a controversial
amendment by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would
effectively bring racial quotas to state death penalty laws
by allowing statistical challenges to them. (The tougher
Thurmond bill is also said to have little future.) This may
be all for the best, for the Supreme Court seems to be moving
efficiently on its own toward putting an end to open-ended
death appeals.

<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The court rejected arguments by death row inmate Warren McCleskey that
Georgia officials violated his rights when they failed to give him a written
statement from the inmate to whom McCleskey allegedly confessed the 1978
slaying of an Atlanta police officer.;    Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for
the court, said McCleskey's failure to raise the issue during an earlier
appeal in 1981 disqualified him from trying to use it in subsequent appeals.; 
  Kennedy said the burden is on defendants in such cases to prove they had
good reason for not raising the issue initially and that their failure to do
so has prejudiced their ability to defend themselves.;    For example, Kennedy
said, the prisoner must prove that state officials deliberately interfered
with his ability to raise the issue.;    It is not necessary for the state to
prove that the defendant deliberately abandoned the issue in an earlier appeal
to raise it subsequently, Kennedy added.;    The only exception to the new
restrictions are those rare instances in which the defendant can show he is
probably innocent of the crime, Kennedy said.;    He said the new rules
"should curtail the abusive petitions that in recent years have threatened to
undermine the integrity of the habeas corpus process.";    Under habeas
corpus, convicted defendants can appeal to the federal courts for help when
they claim their constitutional rights have been violated.;    A proposal in
Congress to limit habeas corpus petitions was introduced after a special study
committee appointed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist recommended time
limits on death row appeals.;    Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting
opinion, said today's ruling "encourages state officials to conceal evidence
that would likely prompt" prisoners to appeal their convictions.;    The court
"tosses aside established precedents without explanation . . . and applies
(new) rules in a way that rewards state misconduct and deceit," Marshall
said.;    McCleskey's murder conviction was overturned in 1989 by a federal
judge who ruled the state had violated his rights in obtaining his confession
to Offie Evans, a fellow prison inmate.;    But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reinstated the conviction, ruling McCleskey forfeited his right to
challenge the constitutionality of the confession by failing to raise the
issue in 1981.;    McCleskey's lawyers said they lacked evidence to challenge
the confession until 1987, when they obtained Evans' written statement after
the Georgia Supreme Court ordered police records made public.;    The defense
lawyers said Evans' statement gave them the first clue that the inmate had
been coached by Atlanta police to elicit a confession from McCleskey.;   
Georgia officials said the state had not deliberately concealed Evans'
statement from the defense. They said McCleskey's lawyers neglected to ask for
it.;    Today's ruling marks the second time the high court has reviewed
McCleskey's case. The court, in an important ruling in 1987, rejected
McCleskey's arguments that state death penalty laws are unconstitutional if
statistics show they are being applied in racially biased ways.;    Studies
have shown that killers of whites in Georgia draw the death penalty far more
often that do killers of blacks.;    The case acted on today is McCleskey vs.
Georgia, 89-7024.;     Other actions;    Other decisions today by the Supreme
Court:; (box)Cable TV -- The justices ruled that states may tax cable
television operators without having to levy the same tax on all other news
media. The 7-2 decision upheld an Arkansas sales tax on cable service.;
(box)Attorney fees -- The court ruled that lawyers who represent themselves in
successful civil rights lawsuits cannot collect attorney fees from the losing
side.  </TEXT>

   When screenwriter Barry Morrow first met
Kim, his original model for the central character in ``Rain Man,''
Kim already knew Morrow's past and present phone numbers and the
number of freeway exits to his house.
   They met in Texas where Kim and his father, Fran, were attending
a 1984 meeting of the American Association of Retarded Citizens.
Kim, 37, is an extremely rare prodigious savant, capable of
recalling virtually anything his senses have ever told him.
   But while Kim has a seemingly unlimited ability to absorb and
recall facts and figures, he has limited reasoning power and his IQ
is a below-average 88. He always has lived with Fran in the Salt
Lake City area, accompanying him on frequent business trips since a
1981 divorce from Kim's mother.
   ``I am Rain Man,'' Kim said in an interview. ``This is an
important time for me. I have many talents now.''
   Morrow, who calls Kim ``an island of genius,'' believes the movie
has changed Kim.
   ``When I first met him, after he talked to me he dashed across
the room and made low moaning sounds,'' Morrow said. ``Now, he would
walk into a room and offer you his hand.''
   Kim's father, who asked for privacy reasons that his and Kim's
last name not be used, agrees that his son is changing. After a
special screening of ``Rain Man'' for the Utah Legislature, Kim
stood up and stressed the importance of understanding the needs of
the handicapped.
   ``I had no idea he could talk to those guys that way,'' Fran
said. ``He is really learning to put his thoughts together.''
   After meeting father and son, Morrow decided he would pair a
savant like Kim _ trusting and sometimes childlike _ with a greedy,
self-centered and impatient brother.
   ``Then I put them in a car and had them drive across the country
together,'' said Morrow, nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay.
It chronicles the relationship between Raymond Babbit, an autistic
savant played by Dustin Hoffman, and his brother, Charlie, played by
Tom Cruise.
   ``I don't want to take away from the other people that helped
Dustin create the character,'' Morrow said by telephone from
Claremont, Calif., ``but Kim was the first inspiration for the
story.''
   Coincidentally, Fran and Kim were rolling down the freeway when
they heard the news last week that ``Rain Man'' had been nominated
for eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor.
   Kim has seen the movie three times, the first seated at the
premier between Morrow and Fran. Kim stared at his hands and the
floor during most of the movie. When Morrow asked him why, Kim told
him he had seen it with his ``heart.''
   While there are behavioral similarities between Kim and Hoffman's
film character, Kim is far more outgoing. Two years ago he spent an
afternoon with Hoffman on a movie set, the actor mimicking his
movements and his walk.
   When it was over, Kim recalls, Hoffman said, ``I may be the star,
but you are the heavens.''
   Daniel Christensen, medical director of the Western Institute of
Neuropsychiatry at the University of Utah, has made a thorough study
of Kim.
   ``He has a photographic memory, but no way to minimize stimuli,''
Christensen said. ``He's the closest I've seen to a human
computer,'' unable to filter or forget information, or assign it
relative importance.
   He can answer untold thousands of questions covering history,
sports, maps, literature, mathematics and other subjects.
   ``You'd expect someone with these mental skills to have something
extra in his brain, but there's actually something missing,''
Christensen said. Brain scans show an absence of the bundle of nerve
fibers _ the corpus callosum _ that connects the two halves of the
brain.
   ``Kim is probably one in 10 million,'' he said.
   Morrow offers another insight. ``Kim has been called a savant
with some autistic characteristics, but the real answer is that,
like all of us, Kim defies human labels.''
   The screenwriter said Hoffman has received a flood of mail from
people touched by the movie, people who know other Rain Men. Morrow
takes little credit for the response.
   ``That was an accident,'' he said. ``The bigger story, bigger
than the movie, is that people are coming out of their prisons and
growing. The awards will go away, but the people like Kim will not.''

   Your April 22 column concerning the long-overdue decision
of the Supreme Court in McCleskey v. Zant (McCleskey's second
habeas case in that court), wrongly accuses the majority of
acting as legislators in that case. The radical expansion of
federal "habeas corpus" jurisdiction to review judgments of
state criminal courts was the product of a pair of cases
decided in 1963, by the revisionist Warren court: Fay v. Noia
and Townsend v. Sain. Subsequent legislation on the subject
merely codified what Congress apparently perceived as minimum
constitutional standards imposed by the Supreme Court.
   The McCleskey case does no more than address the
persistent abuse of the writ in intervening years by
activists seeking to overturn death sentences by any means.
Restoration of the tradition of respect for state court
judgments that was reflected in the Judiciary Act of 1789 can
hardly be considered judicial legislation. Contrary to your
ill-considered statements, federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
is not and never has been "virtually the only way a convicted
prisoner has to protect against law-enforcement abuses."
State courts can and do protect the rights of the parties
before them, and did so largely without federal oversight
until 1963.

<LEADPARA>  For years, the federal courts have stood between many death row inmates and
execution. Now what stands there is Don Edwards.;   At a time when the
popularity of capital punishment runs high, the San Jose congressman is
leading a quixotic effort to protect what he calls "a venerable right": the
broad right of these inmates to appeal their sentences. Today in Washington,
he is announcing the formation of a national committee that will seek to
persuade other members of Congress not to limit death row appeals.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  EDWARDS' DEATH ROW CAMPAIGN
CONGRESSMAN FIGHTS FOR INMATES' RIGHT TO APPEAL
SENTENCES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It is not an effort likely to enhance Edwards' popularity. Nor is it
certain to produce victory when the House of Representatives votes on the
issue later this month.;   Growing numbers of self-styled crime fighters --
including President Bush -- now finger protracted appeals as the major
impediment to an effective death penalty. They point most often to
California's Robert Alton Harris, whose murder conviction has been snarled in
federal court for more than nine years.;   That Edwards has a chance against
these forces is a tribute to the respect he has garnered in his 29-year
career, and to the persuasiveness of his argument that society must be sure
before it condemns a person to death.;   But it is also testament to the
convoluted workings of Washington. Here, well-placed representatives can often
block the most popular initiatives through procedural sleight-of-hand. Edwards
and his allies did just that last year, killing appeals limits that had
previously won approval on the House floor.;   "Don Edwards, God bless him, is
very sincere about this issue, and I respect that," said California Attorney
General Dan Lungren, a leading critic of the death row appeals process. "But
there's something wrong with a situation that allows Congress to reject the
will of the public in its decision-making.";   Edwards responds that Congress
must also defend the rights of unpopular minorities. But he acknowledges that
his safe district in San Jose makes it easier for him to lead this particular
charge. "They just shrug," he said of his constituents. "They say, 'There goes
Edwards again.' ";   The right Edwards defends goes by a Latin name, habeas
corpus, and refers to proceedings in which a prisoner argues that he or she is
in custody in violation of the U.S. Constitution.;   Virtually all of the
nation's 2,300 death row inmates pursue such claims. A 2-year-old study of
Southern capital cases suggests these proceedings delay execution, on average,
by eight years. Inmates can file more than one as long as they are alleging
different constitutional violations: Harris has filed eight state habeas
corpus petitions and three federal petitions.;   Santa Clara County's most
well-known death row inmate, David Luther Ghent, is also pursuing habeas
corpus claims in federal court. He wants a new trial so a jury can consider
whether post-Vietnam stress syndrome drove him to murder his neighbor in
1978.;   Conservatives have tried for years to limit such appeals. In recent
years they've gotten closer, helped by a more conservative Supreme Court, and
by their own success in humanizing the issue.;   John Collins, Washington
representative for Citizens for Law and Order, breaks through the legal
technicalities by talking of his daughter, murdered in 1985. "When there's no
end to the appeals, there's never an end to a family's grief," he says.;  
Edwards came to lead the opposing side because of his chairmanship of the
House subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. He has assembled
high-profile help: the Emergency Committee to Save Habeas Corpus he is
announcing today is chaired by former U.S. Attorneys General Elliott
Richardson and Benjamin Civiletti.;   Statistics gathered by the group
indicate 40 percent of habeas corpus appeals are successful -- illustrating,
Edwards says, that habeas corpus works to ferret out constitutional blunders,
not simply to delay. Among the convictions overturned was that of a Missouri
man whose jury consisted mostly of friends of the county sheriff.;   Yet
Edwards and his supporters are running scared. The Senate has already approved
language in this year's crime bill that limits death row inmates to one
federal appeal, or no appeal if a judge finds an inmate got a "full and fair
hearing" in state court. The House Judiciary Committee opted for an
Edwards-drafted alternative, which preserves broader rights while placing a
one-year time limit on the filing of appeals.;   That sets the stage for a
pair of showdowns, first on the House floor and second in a House-Senate panel
that will negotiate a final crime bill. Though Edwards' liberal allies killed
habeas corpus limits in a similar panel last year, they may spark wider
outrage if they employ the tactic again.;   "It is a desperate situation,"
Edwards said. "But in all candor, I think I have enough experience to see its
importance and make this fight. You know, everyone else around here just talks
about Clarence Thomas. This is more important than Clarence Thomas."  </TEXT>

The House of Representatives is poised to take a major step backward in the 
fight against violent crime. In a bill purporting to be an anti-crime measure, 
the House Judiciary Committee has sent to the floor a proposal that would 
effectively abolish the death penalty in this country. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the death penalty is a just 
punishment for the most heinous crimes. Thirty-six states have adopted capital 
punishment. Yet, for more than a decade, these laws have been rendered almost 
unenforceable by a system that allows convicted murderers to delay 
indefinitely, and ultimately to avoid, imposition of their sentences. After 
exhausting all appeals, murderers are allowed to file endless habeas corpus 
petitions in state and federal court, raising largely technical challenges to 
their convictions and sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The writ of habeas corpus originally was a legal device used to challenge 
attempts by the government to seize and detain an individual without trial. 
During the Warren court era, the writ was converted into a right to multiple 
appeals of issues already decided. This radical expansion of the scope of 
habeas corpus has allowed inmates sentenced to death to nullify their sentences 
through strategic delay. 
</P>
<P>
As of 1988, the average delay from time of sentencing to time of execution of a 
capital sentence was almost seven years. In that same year 296 individuals were 
convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death while only 11 capital 
sentences were actually carried out. Obviously, such delay undermines the 
deterrent and retributive force of the death penalty and breeds frustration and 
disrespect for our criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Robert Alton Harris illustrates the point. In 1978, while on parole 
for voluntary manslaughter, Harris shot two teen-age boys to steal their car 
for a robbery. Later, he confessed to the murders. He was convicted of 
first-degree murder and sentenced to death by a California jury in 1979. In 
1981, the California Supreme Court upheld this conviction and sentence, finding 
that "none of the many contentions raised by (Harris) has merit." Since that 
time, Harris has filed several state and four federal habeas petitions, each of 
which has been rejected. His sentence has still not been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of jurists chaired by retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. has offered a 
solution to this problem. If a state provides those on Death Row with counsel 
at state expense in state habeas corpus proceedings, the prisoner will get only 
two "bites at the apple" -- one state proceeding and one full federal review. 
No further habeas corpus petitions could be filed unless a claim of factual 
innocence were raised. The Bush Administration, the National Assn. of Attorneys 
General and the National District Attorneys Assn. support the principles behind 
Justice Powell's reform proposals. The House bill, far from curing present 
abuses, would make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
First, the House proposal rejects the Powell Committee's quid pro quo 
principle. It affirmatively encourages the filing of successive habeas corpus 
petitions containing claims unrelated to guilt or innocence. At the same time, 
it imposes requirements for state-appointed counsel that very few lawyers can 
meet and even fewer state taxpayers can afford. Under the House proposal, 
convicted murderers like Harris would go on avoiding punishment by raising 
alleged technical "defects" in their sentences -- "defects" that have nothing 
to do with their guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the House proposal overrules two recent Supreme Court decisions that 
attempt to provide some reasonable safeguards against habeas corpus abuse. In 
Teague vs. Lane, the Supreme Court held that prisoners cannot use habeas corpus 
to challenge their convictions based on judicial decisions that were not even 
rendered at the time of their trial and appeals. The House proposal overrules 
Teague, and thus renders every criminal conviction in the nation subject to 
constant challenge based on cases that have not yet even been decided. The 
Judiciary Committee proposal also overrules the court's decision in Wainwright 
vs. Sykes. The Sykes decision requires that defendants follow state procedural 
rules in order to preserve claims for federal review, thus preventing criminal 
defendants from "sandbagging," that is, from holding back their claims in state 
court only to raise them years later in a federal proceeding. The House 
proposal would effectively reward defendants who ignore state procedural rules. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to openly and honestly oppose the death penalty outright -- a 
position the American people have rejected. It is another thing entirely to 
proclaim support for the death penalty in order to curry political favor while 
at the same time voting to erect a labyrinth of procedural rules to prevent the 
penalty from ever being applied. This crime bill is a sheep in wolf's clothing.

<LEADPARA>  In a decision likely to speed executions of death row inmates, the Supreme
Court on Tuesday made it tougher for prisoners to make repeated federal
appeals of their convictions.;    The ruling was a victory for police and
prosecutors, but criminal defense lawyers charged that the decision
drastically curbed the rights of criminal defendants.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It will have the greatest impact on more than 2,400 prisoners living on
death row, where the average time between conviction and execution has been
eight years and four months.;    The 6-3 Supreme Court ruling was the latest
in a series of decisions by the court's conservative majority that, taken
together, have sharply limited the ability of state prisoners to obtain
federal reviews of their convictions and sentences.;    Those decisions dealt
with the scope of petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the method by which
state prisoners, after exhausting their appeals in state courts, may claim in
federal courts that their convictions and sentences violated the U.S.
Constitution.;    The writ is considered a bulwark of U.S. liberties. Criminal
defense and civil liberties lawyers say the liberal use of the writ in the
past has uncovered a high proportion of serious errors.;    On Tuesday,
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court majority, noted that
successive petitions also delay justice, promote disrespect for the law and
waste court resources.;    The new criteria; Under a new rule announced by
Kennedy, a criminal defendant cannot raise a new claim in a second federal
appeal until proving that (1) there was a good reason -- such as a government
coverup of evidence -- for not doing so earlier, and (2) the omission
seriously hurt the defense.;    A defendant who cannot pass that test may be
heard only by showing a probability of innocence.;    The new rule, Kennedy
said, "should curtail the abusive petitions that in recent years have
threatened to undermine the integrity of the habeas corpus process." He was
backed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter.;    But Justice
Thurgood Marshall, joined by Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, accused
the court majority of abandoning precedent, creating "a near-irrebuttable
presumption that omitted claims are permanently barred" and encouraging
government "misconduct and deceit.";    Mary Broderick, a director of the
National Legal Aid and Defender Association declared: "It's just another notch
in the Supreme Court's effort to close the coffin on habeas corpus, another
example of the majority's willingness to ignore serious constitutional
errors.";    Inmate's second defeat;  The decision was a second high court
defeat for Georgia death row inmate Warren McCleskey, a black man convicted of
murdering a white off-duty police officer during a 1978 furniture store
robbery.;    In 1987, the justices rejected his attempt to prove racial
discrimination in death sentences. On Tuesday, in McCleskey vs. Zant, 89-7024,
they barred McCleskey from claiming in a second federal petition that a
confession used at his trial was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment
right to a lawyer.;    He had made such a claim in state appeals but not in
his first federal appeal. McCleskey argued that he had new evidence that had
been withheld by the state: a 21-page statement of the inmate who had heard
McCleskey's confession and reported it to state officials.;    But Kennedy
concluded that because McCleskey "knew everything in the document," its
unavailability did not prevent him from raising his Sixth Amendment claim in
his first federal petition.;     Tuesday's decision also may have dimmed
condemned murderer Robert Alton Harris' chances of getting a federal court to
overturn his California death sentence.;    Out of more than 300 prisoners on
death row in California, only Harris could be affected immediately, since he
is the only one whose case has progressed beyond a first round of federal
court challenges.;    Prosecutor's case bolstered;  A state prosecutor,
preparing for a crucial hearing in Harris' case, said Tuesday's ruling appears
to strengthen his argument that the defense had waited too long to raise
allegations of perjury by a cellmate of Harris.;    Harris was convicted of
the 1978 murders of two San Diego teen-agers whose car he wanted to use in a
bank robbery.;    After an unsuccessful appeal in state court and two rounds
of challenges in federal courts, he came within days of the state's first
execution since 1967 last April. But he was granted a stay in a new federal
appeal that raised two principal issues: ineffective assistance at trial by
psychiatrists, who allegedly failed to detect brain damage, and new evidence
that a cellmate who became a prosecution witness had committed perjury.;   
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ordered a hearing May 7 before a
federal judge in San Diego on the question of whether the cellmate, Joey
Abshire, was acting as a secret informant for police when he talked to Harris
about the killings and later testified about Harris' statements.;    Defense
lawyers have produced a recent statement from Abshire saying his questioning
of Harris was prompted by police, who had told him to deny their involvement.
That allegation could upset the capital murder convictions, but Tuesday's
ruling appeared to increase the possibility that the evidence will be thrown
out of court.;    Under the high court's standard, Harris "has to show that he
could not have raised that issue" in his two earlier federal challenges,
Deputy Attorney General Louis Hanoian said.; STANDARDS FOR DEATH-ROW APPEALS;
Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the Supreme Court majority, outlined new
criteria for allowing second federal appeals to prisoners.;    Prisoners can
appeal again only if:;    (box) They can prove that they had a good reason for
not presenting the claim in the first appeal, and;    (box) That the omission
seriously hurt their defense.; Or if:;     (box) They have evidence that will
show probable innocence.  </TEXT>

the brunt of the hurricane.
   Much of Corpus Christi seemed abandoned Friday, but Ocean Drive
was jammed with traffic as residents and tourists flocked to the
city's seawall with the news that Gilbert would hit farther south
than expected.
   The eye of the hurricane came ashore Friday afternoon about 120
miles south of Brownsville, or about 280 miles from Corpus Christi.
   Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road in
Corpus Christi, as bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined
by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their
boarded-up homes.
   ``This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Ms. Clark, a
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds after
fleeing Port Isabel near Brownsville.
   ``This definitely rates a `10'. But it's also a good day for
conservative, positive sailing,'' said Corpus Christi architect
Robert Jones, one of about a half-dozen surfers who rode high tides
at 4 feet above normal levels.
   ``I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up,
getting kind of bored,'' said Jones. ``I decided I'd just get out
here and see what the winds were like.''
   Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay in Corpus
Christi had heard repeated warnings that Gilbert would likely turn
toward the north, striking land near Brownsville and bashing Corpus
Christi with heavy wind and rain.
   But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward Mexico, the
seawall swelled with confident crowds.
   ``Most people probably wouldn't expect to see this many people
down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in Corpus Christi
for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,''
said Russ Roland, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the
seawall.
   Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the
concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning
water, mugging for cameras.
   Many, including Doug Reiter, said they just grew tired of
sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows.
   ``I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release
from being cooped up,'' he said. ``You can only take that sort of
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''

<LEADPARA>  THE U.S. Supreme Court is out of the closet. The myth that it is only liberals
who are judicial activists stands exposed.;    The Supreme Court has never
acted in as nakedly activist a manner as did the Rehnquist court last month in
a case known as "McCleskey II" (McCleskey vs. Zant). No longer will it be
possible for conservative politicians to proclaim that the appointees of
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush believe in judicial restraint.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Stephen Reinhardt is a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. He wrote this article for the Los Angeles Times.
Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In McCleskey II, the Supreme Court unabashedly legislated drastic
restrictions on one of our most fundamental rights -- the writ of habeas
corpus. The great writ, which dates back to the time of the Magna Carta,
entitles every person to challenge his or her unlawful confinement. It is the
basic check on a police state.;    Overturning long-established judicial
doctrine, the court held in McCleskey II that a person who is sentenced to die
following a prosecution tainted by serious governmental misconduct may not
file a petition for habeas corpus if he previously filed one and failed to
complain of the government's conduct -- even though he was unaware of the
critical facts because the government had deliberately concealed them from
him.;    In the name of efficiency and speed, the Supreme Court deliberately
chose to sacrifice fairness and due process.;    It is not surprising that the
court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has, in a series of cases,
systematically gone about the process of dismantling habeas corpus. This court
has shown little concern with individual rights or personal freedom. Rather,
it has sought to increase the authority of government over the private lives
of individuals and to undermine historic protections against police abuse.;   
Only a week before McCleskey II, in the case of Arizona vs. Fulminante, one of
the court's most conservative justices, Byron R. White, made it clear that
even he could not stomach some of the more extreme activism of the
Rehnquist-led majority.;    Regarding the court's ruling that the use of a
coerced confession does not necessarily render a trial unfair, White
caustically observed, "Today, a majority of the court, without any
justification, overrules this vast body of precedent without a word and in so
doing dislodges one of the fundamental tenets of our criminal justice
system.";    On April 16, a day that judicial scholars and defenders of civil
liberties will long remember, the right wing of the court, with Justice White
back in the fold, did by judicial fiat what Chief Justice Rehnquist had been
unable to accomplish through other means.;    The events leading up to
McCleskey II are extraordinary. In his eagerness to limit the right of death
row inmates to challenge the constitutionality of their sentences, the chief
justice of the United States undertook several unusual steps.;    First, he
appointed a committee of five judges from the South, where almost all recent
executions have occurred, to conduct a congressionally mandated study of how
death-penalty appeals could be curtailed. The committee, headed by former
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, brought forth precisely the type of report
that might have been anticipated. The chief justice immediately forwarded it
to Congress.;    The Powell report recommended prohibiting a second habeas
corpus challenge to a death sentence, even when the state had knowingly used
perjured testimony or had otherwise wrongfully concealed from the defendant
facts that would require reversal of the sentence.;    When the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joseph Biden, D-Del., questioned Powell about
this patently unfair provision, Powell replied that his report couldn't
possibly mean what it said. Moments later, the chief staff member of the
Powell committee corrected his boss; he told Biden that Powell had made an
error, that the rights of unconstitutionally sentenced death row defendants
would indeed be cut off under the Powell proposal.;    The Rehnquist-endorsed
plan quickly suffered a series of resounding defeats.;    First, a majority of
the members of the Judicial Council of the United States, a body composed of
the nation's most senior judges, a group that ordinarily ratifies with
enthusiasm any suggestion by a chief justice, rejected the most controversial
parts of the Powell report.;    Then Congress, despite intense lobbying by the
U.S. attorney general and state prosecutors, refused to include any part of
the Powell committee's recommendations in the 1990 crime bill.;    A few
months later, the Supreme Court struck back. Having failed to obtain from
Congress the legislation the chief justice sought, the "conservative" majority
adopted the rule rejected by Congress, not only for death sentences, but also
for all convictions.;    The long-run consequences of this exercise in
judicial activism remain to be seen. At the least, one might hope that in the
future, frank discussion of the role of judicial philosophy and attitudes in
decision-making will be possible, and attacks on liberal judges by demagogic
office-seekers will be seen for the arrant hypocrisy they have always been.;  
 It is clear what we can expect from the Supreme Court for the foreseeable
future. In four or five years, the "conservative" majority has overturned
decades of civil-rights rulings, eliminated fundamental deterrents to unlawful
police practices, gutted the longstanding protection of religious practices by
persons other than those belonging to a "majority" religion, sanctioned the
invasion of the bedroom and the criminalization of homosexual conduct, and
proclaimed its eagerness to overturn the right to abortion as soon as one more
vote can be garnered.;    Certainly, today's majority is no believer in
judicial precedent. Nor does it follow the doctrines of "judicial restraint"
or "strict construction." A far different term from "conservative" is needed
to describe the activist right-wing majority that is rewriting constitutional
law in its own image.;    The judicial and political ideology that drives the
Supreme Court does not portend well for individual rights or fundamental
freedoms in these United States.  </TEXT>

HIGH COURT ACTS TO SPEED ITS REVIEW OF CAPITAL CASES

<P>
Over objections from two justices, the state Supreme Court on Tuesday issued 
new procedural rules designed to speed the review of death-penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
The new standards require defense attorneys to ensure that habeas corpus 
petitions -- in which condemned prisoners raise new issues that go beyond 
claims in their direct appeals to the court -- are filed "without substantial 
delay." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, these secondary appeals, which raise such issues as inadequate trial 
counsel or newly discovered evidence, ordinarily have not been filed until 
after the defendant's direct appeal has been decided by the high court. Under 
the new rules, both such appeals ordinarily will have to be filed at virtually 
the same time, enabling the justices to consolidate their review of the 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The rules, announced in a statement by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, were 
issued in the wake of widespread concern among legal authorities over delay and 
uncertainty in the review of capital appeals. Lucas is co-chairman of an 
American Bar Assn. task force studying the problem in both state and federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard, two liberals on a 
conservative-dominated high court, dissented from the rules "on various 
grounds," Tuesday's cryptically worded statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosk, it said, "particularly opposed" provisions that would impose new time 
standards requiring that, with some exceptions, habeas corpus petitions must be 
filed within 60 days after final briefs are due in the defendant's direct 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard "primarily objected" to applying the new standards to pending cases, 
Lucas' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also drew sharp criticism from Michael D. Laurence, 
director of the Death Penalty Project of American Civil Liberties Union of 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence warned that requiring defense attorneys to investigate cases and 
prepare briefs in direct appeals and habeas appeals at the same time could 
jeopardize the quality of a defendant's legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a risk that innocent people may be rushed through the system because 
an appellate attorney was rushed through the system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Millman, director of the California Appellate Project, a nonprofit 
group that assists lawyers in capital appeals, said the new standards will be 
"helpful in clarifying the expectations" of defense counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But Millman voiced concern about the fairness of applying to pending cases new 
rules that appear to represent "a significant break" from past procedures. 
</P>
<P>
On a different front, state Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane R. Gillette expressed doubt 
that the new rules would weaken the quality of habeas corpus petitions. And he 
welcomed the new policy as one that would improve the speed and efficiency of 
the whole capital appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're enthusiastic about the new rules," Gillette said. "By combining the 
habeas proceedings with the direct appeal, we can get these cases through the 
state system much more expeditiously. . . . Overall, it will benefit the 
criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules say that habeas corpus petitions that are not filed within 60 
days of final briefs in direct appeals can be denied as "untimely." But the 
court will allow exceptions to the limit when defense counsel can show that 
petitions were filed within a "reasonable time" after they became aware of new 
facts or legal issues about a case. 
</P>
<P>
The rules also require court-appointed counsel to represent condemned prisoners 
all the way through direct and secondary appeals in state and federal court 
and, if necessary, to seek clemency from the governor for an inmate who faces 
imminent execution. 
</P>
<P>
The justices will consider replacing such attorneys "only if appropriate 
replacement counsel is ready and willing" to take over the job, Lucas said in 
the statement.

   The Justice Department opposes congressional
proposals aimed at eliminating lengthy delays of death penalty
appeals.
   A House plan would have the reverse effect of stringing out the
appeal process, and a Senate plan has technical defects, Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Paul L. Maloney told a House panel
Wednesday.
   The Senate plan, cosponsored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is designed to shorten death penalty delays
by replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal
court review.
   Habeas corpus proceedings are used by defendants who have been
sentenced to death and are trying to win new trials or sentences.
The Specter-Thurmond amendment was defeated, then passed 12 hours
later on May 24, allowing it to be added to a comprehensive Senate
anti-crime bill.
   The amendment would require federal habeas corpus petitions to be
filed within 60 days after final action by state courts.
   The amendment raises ``interesting possibilities'' for reducing
appeals delays ``through a stronger, more comprehensive system of
time limitation rules,'' Maloney told a House Judiciary subcommittee.
   But he added, ``We do find that there are some defects, some
technical problems if you will.'' Under questioning, he said the
amendment was still under review and that he was not prepared to
specify what the problems were.
   The two proposals are among several under consideration in
Congress to speed up death penalty appeals while ensuring
defendants' rights.
   The House plan, sponsored by Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards.
   The bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple
prisoner petitions, and establishing a one-year limit within for
inmates to file for federal habeas relief.
   But Maloney said the measure ``multiplies the opportunity for
delay and abuse'' in capital cases.
   He quoted retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, who said
recently that a vote for Kastenmeier's bill ``would in practical
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the United
States.''
   The department would recommend that President Bush veto the bill
if it passed Congress in its present form, Maloney said.
   But the bill was backed during Wednesday's hearing by civil
rights leader Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. He said a broader supervisory role by the
federal judiciary was needed to stop the ``inexhaustible litany of
racial discrimination cases in the courts in the rural South.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCorp will sell its interest in MBank Corpus
Christi to the bank's managers, company officials said Friday. It
would be the second such transaction in less than two weeks.
   The deal, which is subject to regulatory and bankruptcy court
approvals, would leave MCorp, once the state's second-largest bank
holding company, with three subsidiaries to sell.
   A group of investors led by Jerry Gates, chairman and chief
executive officer of MBank Corpus Christi, will become the bank's
owner under an agreement with MCorp. The sale is expected to be
complete by July 31.
   The bank had assets of $582 million and deposits of $502 million
on Dec. 31, 1989.
   The bank's name will be changed to Corpus Christi National Bank,
the name under which it was originally chartered 100 years ago.
   ``Over the past few months, as events unfolded which made it
appear that local ownership of the bank was a possibility, we've
received hundreds of comments from customers and community leaders
expressing their support for the return of Corpus Christi National
Bank,'' Gates said.
   Terms of the agreement call for MCorp to receive an undisclosed
amount of assets, mostly loans and real estate, for the bank's
stock. MBank Corpus Christi will simultaneously issue $20 million
in new stock.
   MCorp, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since March
1989, last week said it had reached an agreement to sell MBank El
Paso to its managers.
   The Dallas-based firm is trying to sell its remaining banking
subsidiaries in Brownsville, New Braunfels and Waco.
   ``We are looking to sell those assuming we can get what we view
as adequate or proper value for the benefit of our shareholders,''
said MCorp spokesman Doug Hughes.
   The five banks remained with MCorp after the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. stripped it of 20 banking subsidiaries following
the bankruptcy filing. Those 20 banks were bought by Banc One
Corp., an Ohio banking company, and now operate as Bank One-Texas.
   MCorp's federally assisted bailout was the third largest in
history after those of Continental Illinois in 1984 and First
Republic Corp. of Dallas in 1988.

<LEADPARA>  'THIS is more important than Clarence Thomas," Don Edwards keeps insisting.
And for death row prison inmates, the San Jose Democrat's latest cause is,
literally, a matter of life and death.;   Edwards is trying to block a Bush
administration bid to cut off most state prisoner appeals to federal courts.
The congressman and other members of an "Emergency Committee to Save Habeas
Corpus" say that 40 percent of such appeals are upheld, proving their merit.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ONE LAST CHANCE
PRISONERS' APPEALS TO FEDERAL COURT SHOULD BE
LIMITED, NOT ELIMINATED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Edwards is pushing a more moderate reform endorsed by the American Bar
Association and other legal organizations. Instead of virtually ending federal
habeas corpus proceedings, they would limit prisoners to one petition each and
impose a one-year deadline for filing.;   Latin for "you should have the
body," habeas corpus is a centuries-old defense against illegal imprisonment.
It applies to all inmates, but appeals from those sentenced to death are
especially numerous.;   We have no doubt that such appeals are flooding our
courts, state and federal, and that some prisoners have used them to delay
their executions for years. But for a society that aspires to justice, the
proper response is not to abolish the right of appeal, but to restrict its
abuse.;   Edwards finds himself in this fight for two reasons. He chairs the
civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.
And as a long-time champion of civil liberties -- and dean of the California
delegation -- he's ideologically willing to take on an unpopular cause, and
politically powerful enough to get away with it.;   The Senate, swept along on
get-tough-on-crime sentiments, has passed the Bush version. Let's hope the
House will be wiser, and opt for the more moderate course urged by Edwards.  </TEXT>

   Anti-Crime Bill

   WASHINGTON -- The House passed an anti-crime bill that
would expand the federal death penalty and increase spending
for local law enforcement and state prisons.
   The package, approved 305-118, differs in several aspects
from legislation passed by the Senate in July. Lawmakers must
iron out those differences in a conference before sending a
bill to President Bush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The major point of contention at the conference probably
will be how much to curb state prisoners' rights to file
appeals in federal courts on constitutional grounds. The
House version would limit the availability of these so-called
habeas corpus petitions in many cases. The Senate version, in
contrast, would in effect eliminate these appeals, according
to Democratic lawmakers. President Bush favors the more
stringent approach.
   Last year, both houses passed anti-crime bills, but
conferees were unable to work out compromises; the final
package was stripped of its most controversial provisions,
including those limiting habeas corpus petitions.
   Compromise is somewhat more likely this year. For one
thing, the House passed death-penalty provisions similar to
those approved in the Senate. Both versions would expand the
federal death penalty to cover 50 additional crimes,
including murder of high government officials, espionage and
certain drug crimes. The House, as the Senate did earlier,
struck from its bill language that would have allowed a
defendant to avoid execution if he could prove that capital
punishment had been applied in a racially disproportionate
fashion in that jurisdiction.
   The passage of the death-penalty provisions, stripped of a
"racial justice" defense, is a major victory for President
Bush, who has made capital punishment a centerpiece of his
anti-crime program. Eager to appear just as "tough" as
Republicans, most Democrats supported the death-penalty
provisions.
   Both houses also have passed variations of a weeklong
mandatory waiting period for handgun purchases. Mr. Bush has
said he will sign such a gun-control provision only if
Congress presents him with death-penalty and habeas corpus
measures to his liking. The Senate passed a ban on nine types
of semi-automatic "assault" weapons; the House rejected a
similar provision.
   The House bill includes a broader exception to the
so-called exclusionary rule, under which judges prevent
illegally gathered evidence from being admitted in court. The
Senate version would allow admission of such evidence when
police made a "good faith" mistake but did seek a search
warrant. The House version would apply even when police
didn't get a warrant.

   The Justice Department said Wednesday it
opposes a House plan backed by some federal judges to give death row
inmates more appeal rights than they now have.
   The department said also that it had ``technical problems'' with
a Senate-adopted amendment to shorten death penalty delays by
replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal
court review.
   Defendants sentenced to death sometimes use habeas corpus
hearings in attempts to win new trials or sentences. The Senate
amendment was defeated, then passed 12 hours later on May 24 as part
of a comprehensive anti-crime bill.
   The House and Senate proposals are among several under
consideration in Congress to speed up death penalty appeals while
ensuring defendants' rights.
   Deputy Assistant Attorney General Paul L. Maloney told a House
Judiciary subcommittee that the House plan would cause delays and
repetition in appeals, and that the Senate proposal contained
``defects.''
   The House plan is sponsored by Rep. Paul Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on courts. It
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards.
   The bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple
prisoner petitions, and establishing a one-year limit for inmates to
file for federal habeas relief.
   But Maloney said the measure ``multiplies the opportunity for
delay and abuse'' in capital cases.
   He quoted retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, who said
recently that a vote for Kastenmeier's bill ``would in practical
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the United

   The bill was backed during Thursday's hearing by Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He said a
broader supervisory role by the federal judiciary was needed to stop
the ``inexhaustible litany of racial discrimination cases in the
courts in the rural south.''
   The bill also has the support of several federal judges,
including Gilbert Merritt of Nashville, Tenn., chief judge of the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Maloney said also that the department was not ready to support
the amendment requiring the filing of habeas corpus petitions within
60 days after final action by state courts. The amendment was
authored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   The Specter-Thurmond amendment raises ``interesting
possibilities'' for reducing appeals delays ``through a stronger,
more comprehensive system of time limitation rules,'' Maloney said.
   But he added, ``We do find that there are some defects, some

<TEXT>     Death row prisoner Dennis Wayne Smith won a new trial in Florida because
his jury hadn't been told that the only witness to place Smith at the scene of
the crime had failed to mention Smith at all in his first statement to the
police.;    Constitutional blunders like these -- all of which survived state
court review and were remedied only in the federal courts -- are not
uncommon.;    But correcting them could get much more difficult if the Bush
administration succeeds with new legislation it is pushing, say many experts.;
   The administration bill would drastically curb a legal process known as
federal habeas corpus, designed to protect prisoners against injustices in
state courts.;    Over the past 15 years, federal judges have reversed
convictions, sentences or both in nearly 40 percent of all the death penalty
cases brought before them under this process.;    Critics of the
administration's action, while acknowledging that the complex appeals process
badly needs reform, accuse the administration of making the greatest assault
on habeas corpus since President Lincoln abolished it during the Civil War.;  
 "If the administration bill passes, federal habeas corpus will be legal
history," said American University law Professor Ira Robbins.;   
Administration's proposal; The administration's proposal, contained in its
broader crime bill, would shut federal courthouse doors to all death row
defendants whose claims were "fully and fairly" handled by the state courts.; 
  "That means," Robbins said, "that so long as the state appeals process was
adequate and fair, even if it led to incorrect results, that's good enough."; 
  Bush administration officials, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, his
conservative colleagues on the Supreme Court, most prosecutors, and often the
families of crime victims view habeas corpus as a constitutional guarantee
gone out of whack, an extraordinarily complex maze of repetitive, piecemeal,
chaotic and seemingly endless appeals.;    They see 2,457 convicted murderers
on death row filing 13,000 habeas petitions a year in a convoluted system in
which only 146 killers have been executed since the Supreme Court restored the
death penalty in 1973.;    For inmates executed in 1988, the average elapsed
time from sentence to execution was six years and eight months. For some death
row inmates, the appeals process has dragged out far longer.;    For example,
it has been 13 years since Robert Alton Harris killed two San Diego high
school boys, shooting one of the boys as he prayed for his life.;    Harris
has remained alive on death row while his resourceful lawyers carried various
issues through 75 state and federal court reviews, including four separate
appeals to the Supreme Court.;    Now, after coming within days of execution
at San Quentin, Harris is awaiting word from a federal appeals panel in San
Francisco on two new issues, including alleged perjury by a cellmate.;   
"What we are trying to do," White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said of the
administration's habeas corpus reform, "is to make sure that something that is
a principle of protection does not become a mechanism for unlimited
procrastination. . . . It's where the Supreme Court is headed.";    The
Supreme Court has placed new limits on federal habeas corpus three times in
the past three years.;    Errors still surface; Significant constitutional
errors continue to be uncovered in federal courts. In 1989, when the 9th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overturned a Montana death sentence, Judge
Stephen Reinhardt observed:;    "The mockery of our criminal justice system
lies not in repetitive federal review but in the persistent disregard by our
(state) courts of fundamental constitutional rights.";    "Some inmates have
gone to their deaths despite the existence of clear constitutional errors,"
Robbins said. "We know that, because their co-defendants won reversals. There
are at least three cases like that.";    In one of them, Rebecca Machetti
masterminded the murder plot and her husband, Tony, fired the shots. Both were
convicted and sentenced to death.;    But on appeal in the federal courts,
Rebecca Machetti's lawyers successfully argued that the jury system in Bibb
County, Ga., systematically excluded women. She got a new trial and was
sentenced to life imprisonment.;    Tony Machetti's lawyers could have raised
the same jury issue but did not do so until it was too late, and he was
executed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The Senate today approved President Bush's plan to severely limit legal
maneuvers by death row inmates seeking to delay their executions.;    The
White House proposal, passed 58-40, would block so-called habeas corpus
petitions in federal court unless the judge found that state courts treated
the defendant unfairly, and those petitions would have to be filed within six
months.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BACKING BUSH, SENATE LIMITS DEATH ROW APPEALS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Democrats had proposed a time limit, but without such strict standards for
the initial appeal. After the first petition, subsequent efforts would be
barred unless new facts came to light or if the Supreme Court changed the
law.;    Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., argued the Bush plan would "rid us of
abuse" but "at the very high price of endangering our constitutional rights.";
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the Democratic proposal had too many
loopholes. "There is no reason why the federal courts must hear every claim,
in every case at every time," he said.;    The plan to limit death row appeals
was approved a day after the Senate voted to expand the federal death penalty
to dozens of additional crimes.;    The amendment are part of an overall crime
bill touching on many controversial subjects.;    Senate leaders planned to
finish the bill this week but that was put in doubt Tuesday when Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., an amendment to ban all job preference based on race, national
origin or similar factors -- an issue other lawmakers didn't want to tack on
the crime bill.;    By votes of 73-25 and 68-30 Tuesday, senators affirmed
their support for expanding the federal death penalty to 49 more crimes,
including everything from assassination of the president to the slaying of a
federal poultry inspector.;    Additional crimes might be added before the
Senate finishes the bill. Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, has proposed the death
penalty for drug-related killings in the District of Columbia.;    But before
voting on more capital punishment provisions, the Senate planned to deal with
its frustration that in some cases, by filing multiple petitions, people
sentenced to death have managed to avoid execution for years.;    "Americans
cannot understand why it takes so many years . . . why it takes so much of the
energy of our legal system . . . to have the consequences of truth and justice
executed," said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.;    Graham was sponsoring an amendment
that would put a six-month time limit on the filing of a habeas corpus
petition. After the first, additional attempts would be allowed only if they
went directly to the question of guilt or innocence or, under limited
conditions, to the appropriateness of the death penalty.;    Graham also would
require states to provide qualified lawyers to handle such appeals for
indigent inmates.;    Republicans said the Democrats' plan would attract a
veto by the president because it was not restrictive enough. And providing
lawyers would result in more petitions than currently clog the courts, they
said.;    Democrats contend Bush's version would virtually eliminate habeas
corpus, seriously hurting justice in the interest of expediency.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The House is nearing approval of an anticrime
bill that would expand the use of the death penalty, but it first
must choose between two plans designed to shorten delays in
carrying out executions.
   ``We who are the lawmakers believe that when the death penalty
is meted out, it should be done fairly but it should be done
expeditiously,'' Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., said Wednesday as
debate got under way.
   Conservatives clamoring for tougher death penalty provisions
were blamed by the chief sponsor, Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., for
turning the bill into a ``political football'' a month before
congressional elections.
   Under the bill, federal courts could impose the death penalty
for assassination of a range of government officials. The offenses
of treason and espionage also would be punishable by death.
   The bill also seeks to limit the number of habeas corpus
petitions inmates under death sentence could file and thus postpone
execution, by a decade or more in some case. Such petitions
challenge whether a prisoner is being held legally.
   Other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for
convicted drug offenders to a one-year prison term for illegal
possession of steroids.
   If approved, the bill would go to a conference committee for
resolution of differences with a Senate-passed version.
   President Bush has criticized the House bill, saying some
features are less stringent that current law. He has been critical
of provisions that would allow death row inmates to use racial
statistics to bolster their appeals.
   Bush also has attacked the habeas corpus provision, saying that
far from speeding up the appeals process, it would stretch it to
greater length.
   Conservatives led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., are pushing for
a tightened version and last week succeeded in blocking floor
action until Democrats agreed to a vote on their plan.
   The bill would require those under death sentence to file their
habeas corpus petitions within a year after exhausting their direct
appeals. It would limit them to one petition but provide for a
number of exceptions. Hyde wants to substitute a provision that
would allow state to impose the limits as long as the defendants
were represented by competent lawyers.
   Republicans also have forced sponsors to allow a vote on an
amendment sponsored by Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio, that would
permit confiscation of the homes of those convicted of savings and
loan fraud. ``I'm tired of the lavish lifestyles of the S&amp;L
crooks,'' Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., declared.
   Hughes pleaded with Republicans not to try to pepper the bill
with unconstitutional amendments. He said a tough bill was needed,
but also ``a bill we can all be proud of, a bill we can all go home
and campaign on.''
   GOP lawmakers, however, made it clear they wanted a substantial
reshaping of the legislation.
   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., denounced ``endless appeals and
twisting the rules to prevent the will of the people from being
carried out.''
   ``In its present form, it would not help law enforcement, it
would hinder law enforcement,'' said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.
   ``Some of my Republican colleagues want to play political
football with this issue,'' Hughes finally said. `` ... But the
Republican colleagues in my opinion are wrong in their belief that
the American public will award the moral high ground to whoever
claims to be the most bloodthirsty.''

   A young man pleaded guilty to robbing
an American tourist and in a fit of remorse asked that his 12-year
jail sentence be increased, the government's news agency reported
today.
   The agency said Judge Leonardo B. Canares of Cebu City, 350 miles
south of Manila, immediately obliged Wesley Corpus' request and
slapped one more year onto the jail term.
   The agency said the incident occurred Tuesday after Corpus
pleaded guilty to robbery charges and told the judge he felt the
original 12-year sentence was not enough.
   Corpus was accused of robbing an unidentified American of a gold
necklace worth $250.

GOVERNOR ASSAILS U.S. DELAYS OF DEATH CASES

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday assailed long delays in resolving capital 
cases and urged that federal judges curtail reviews of constitutional 
challenges to death sentences already upheld in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal courts should accept these petitions as seldom as is necessary," said 
Deukmejian, appearing at a hearing on behalf of the National Governors Assn. 
"If there has been a full and fair adjudication of the issues in state courts, 
they should accept that." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said that delay in reviewing appeals prevents capital punishment 
from serving as an effective deterrent to crime and enables criminals to "thumb 
their noses at the law," knowing that even if they are caught, they still can 
avoid paying the full price. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian testified before a special task force of judges and other legal 
authorities that is studying time-consuming delay, repetitive appeals, court 
congestion and other problems that critics say are plaguing federal 
constitutional challenges in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Such challenges are made in federal habeas corpus petitions that are filed 
after a defendant's conviction and sentence have been upheld in state courts. 
The petitions are restricted to claims of violation of federal constitutional 
rights, but the ability to file them has been substantially expanded by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. Currently, about 9,500 federal habeas 
corpus petitions are being filed annually in the United States, an estimated 5% 
of them in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member panel, sponsored by the American Bar Assn. and co-chaired by 
California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, is receiving testimony from 
prosecutors, defense attorneys and officials in a series of nationwide 
hearings. The panel began two days of proceedings here at a time when there is 
growing concern among judges, lawyers and other authorities over the prospect 
of long delays in the review of California capital cases in the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court under Lucas has sharply accelerated its review of 
death-penalty cases, upholding 54 capital sentences in just two years. But the 
death verdicts upheld by the state court are being challenged further in what 
officials expect will be a wave of constitutional appeals in the federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and other witnesses cited as an example of their concern the case of 
Robert Alton Harris, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders 
of two youths in San Diego in 1978. His is the furthest along of any California 
capital case now in the federal court system and has been before federal judges 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' conviction and sentence were upheld in separate appeals by the state 
Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and, last July, by the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. But his subsequent petition for a rehearing before the 
federal appellate court is pending -- nearly a full year later. 
</P>
<P>
The governor urged the panelists to seek reforms in the process that would 
impose new time limits on federal habeas corpus appeals and require federal 
judges to defer to the factual findings made by state courts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. George M. Palmer told the panel there 
could be substantial additional delays when capital cases that have been in the 
state courts for years begin to flow into the federal courts. "When the bulk of 
the California cases hits the federal system, the road to final judgments will 
be long indeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, six habeas corpus petitions from condemned California inmates have 
been filed in federal courts. But the number is expected to increase 
considerably in coming months and a special committee of judges, lawyers and 
officials has been at work preparing new procedures to deal with the influx. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent rebuke to Deukmejian, San Francisco attorney Dennis P. Riordan, 
representing California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a group of defense 
lawyers, said that appeals to the federal courts would present little problem 
if state court judges would act to protect the rights of capital defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan noted that unlike federal judges, state judges do not enjoy lifetime 
tenure and warned that thus they are far more subject to election 
considerations and other political pressures that could influence their rulings 
in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the bitter 1986 California election that saw three high court 
members rejected by the voters, largely because of their reluctance to affirm 
death judgments, Riordan said: 
</P>
<P>
"A state judge who rules in favor of any capital defendant on any issue can be 
assured his ruling, no matter how clearly dictated by controlling 
constitutional precedent, will be publicly attacked by an opportunistic 
politician too dense to understand our system of constitutional rights or too 
cynical to care about its preservation." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan observed that in the seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court 
reinstated capital punishment in 1976, federal appeal courts, reviewing cases 
mainly from the South, found constitutional violations in 73% of the state 
court death rulings they reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as more cases from the Western states are taken to federal courts, there 
is no less reason for careful review of death verdicts, he said.

   A judge ordered doctors to turn off
the life-support system for a comatose 13-year-old girl despite her
mother's wish that she be kept alive until her brother can return
from abroad to say goodbye.
   After an emotional hour-long hearing, state District Judge Jack
E. Hunter ruled Friday that Djahna Iolani Vogler's support system
could be turned off so doctors could recover organs for transplant
operations.
   The girl's father, Tx Paul Delmar Vogler of Houston, had sought
the order.
   Hunter's ruling was sent to the hospital by fax machine and the
system was disconnected. The teen-ager died a short time later and
some of her organs were recovered by an organ bank, officials said.
   The girl was being treated for an overdose of an anti-depressant
she ingested Monday at a home for psychologically disturbed youths.
   The girl had been comatose since being brought to the DeTar
Hospital in Victoria, 50 miles north of Corpus Christi, and doctors
Thursday declared her brain dead.
   ``There's no way to say how long those organs will be viable,''
Dr. Richard Sawyers testified over a telephone speaker in the
Corpus Christi courtroom. ``She could have a heart attack or kidney
failure.''
   Djahna's mother, Terry Sue Vogler of Corpus Christi, had asked
Hunter to keep Djahna on life support until Mrs. Vogler's son,
Steven, stationed with the Army in West Germany, could return.
   ``He said, `Mama, I'm coming home ... don't let them do anything
until I get there,''' Mrs. Vogler told the judge.
   Mrs. Vogler, who didn't oppose the organ donation, wept as
Hunter issued the ruling.
   ``The court must look at the overall picture,'' Hunter said.
``The only reason the child is alive now is because of the
respirator. The heart, liver and kidneys will give life to another
individual.
   ``Mrs. Vogler, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the entire family.''
   Steven Vogler, 22, apparently arrived home to Corpus Christi
Friday night, some hours after the hearing.
   Djahna had overdosed on desipramine, an anti-depressant. She had
been living at the Devereux Foundation, a private psychiatric
treatment facility where she was placed last summer on the
recommendation of a doctor who said she suffered from depression.
   Her parents were divorced almost nine years ago. The teen-ager
was in the legal custody of her father.

   WASHINGTON -- More than any other issue, getting tough
with criminals dominated the Supreme Court term that ended
yesterday.
   Throughout the term, the high court attempted to reverse
what its new conservative majority believes was excessive
expansion of the rights of accused people during the 1960s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pronounced law-and-order turn of the court culminated
yesterday with the justices' 6-3 ruling overturning a 1987
precedent and allowing use of information about victims'
families in death-penalty sentencing. The justices also
ruled, 5-4, that the Constitution doesn't bar mandatory life
imprisonment for a first drug offense.
   "We are really seeing a solid conservative majority emerge
in the criminal-law area, almost across the board," says Alan
Slobodin, a lawyer with the conservative Washington Legal
Foundation. Some say the court has run roughshod over civil
liberties.
   This month marked anniversaries of two of the most
important rulings ever for the rights of defendants. In June
1961, the Supreme Court applied the exclusionary rule to the
states, ruling that evidence obtained in violation of the
Fourth Amendment's protection from improper searches couldn't
be used in a criminal trial. And in 1966, the court issued
the Miranda decision, which said the Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination requires police to warn
suspects of their rights before taking them into custody and
interrogating them.
   This term, the court's concerns ran largely in the other
direction. The justices made it easier for police with no
warrants to search buses for drugs or to open and examine
suitcases or paper bags they find in the trunks of cars. The
court also allowed prosecutors to use some coerced
confessions as evidence against defendants, and it authorized
the jailing of individuals for up to 48 hours without a court
hearing, during which time police could work to see if there
is probable cause for the arrest.
   Yesterday's decision to allow the use of so-called victim
impact information in death-penalty cases culminated a
conservative effort that began almost as soon as the 1987
ruling banning use of such information in capital cases was
announced. The earlier decision was by a 5-4 vote. With
subsequent changes in the makeup of the court, that slim
majority disappeared, but the conservative justices were
unable to muster enough votes in two previous attempts to
overrule the 1987 decision.
   Yesterday, however, in an opinion written by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, the votes were there and the earlier
decision was cast aside, with Justice David Souter joining
the majority. Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and
John Stevens dissented. (Payne vs. Tennessee)
   In yesterday's other ruling, the justices substantially
weakened a 1983 decision that said the Eighth Amendment
prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishment" requires that a
criminal sentence be proportionate to the crime. In an
opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court said a
Michigan law that required a life sentence for possession of
672 grams of cocaine, may be "unusual," but isn't "cruel" and
isn't unconstitutional. (Harmelin vs. Michigan)
   The tough turn in the high court's approach was
foreshadowed 23 years ago, when Richard Nixon campaigned for
president vowing to appoint justices who would show more
support for victims and the police. But even though Mr. Nixon
named four justices, his law-and-order court never fully
materialized. The court of the 1970s tinkered quite a bit,
but fundamentally altered relatively little.
   All that has changed. "The conservative court has the
votes and it's off and running," says Yale Kamisar, a
professor at the University of Michigan Law School. "There
are virtually no constraints on them," says Louis Michael
Seidman, a Georgetown University Law School professor.
   Nowhere has this been more apparent than in death-penalty
cases.
   First, in two major decisions this year, the high court
cut back sharply on the availability to death row inmates of
federal habeas corpus -- a civil lawsuit filed most often by
a convicted prisoner whose appeals have been denied and who
claims that his arrest or trial was unconstitutional. In the
1960s, the Supreme Court vastly expanded federal court review
of state criminal convictions.
   Chief Justice Rehnquist has long argued that the system is
abused by prisoners who file one habeas corpus petition after
another, causing their executions to be deferred for years.
Rather than wait for Congress to curtail the alleged abuses,
the high court took matters in its own hands.
   The justices set tougher standards for inmates who file
second habeas petitions to prove that their claims couldn't
have been raised in their first petition. The justices also
ruled that federal courts shouldn't consider first habeas
petitions if those petitions didn't comply with state court
procedural rules.
   "They've really almost done away with habeas corpus," says
Professor Kamisar.
   The track record isn't all one-sided. The court threw out
a few death sentences and, perhaps in honor of the Miranda
decision's 25th anniversary, ruled that once a suspect has
asked to consult a lawyer, police can't resume questioning
unless the lawyer is present.

<HEAD>Court Will Study Appeal of Convicted Chicago Murderer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study the
appeal of a convicted Chicago murderer sentenced to 50 to 100 years
in prison for his crime.
   The justices said they will use Warren Lee Harris' case to give
federal courts some further guidance in how to handle the appeals
of defendants convicted in state courts.
   Harris was convicted of the July 19, 1977, murder in Chicago of
Earnest Howard.
   After his conviction was upheld by the Illinois courts on direct
appeal, Harris filed a so-called habeas corpus appeal in state
courts. In it, he contended for the first time that he was denied
adequate legal help at his trial.
   State courts ruled that Harris could not raise that issue
because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, but it then
rejected the merits of Harris' ineffective-assistance argument.
   Harris then sought help from the federal courts, in a habeas
corpus petition raising the same issue.
   A federal trial judge ruled that Harris' procedural default,
which usually would preclude federal court review of his claim, had
been waived by the state courts.
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June 12 ruled
that the procedural default blocks federal court review of the
ineffective-assistance argument.
   The case is Harris vs. Reed, 87-5677.

By STEPHEN REINHARDT, Judge Stephen Reinhardt sits on the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. and 
composed exclusively of federal judges from the South has recommended drastic 
limitations on the rights of condemned people awaiting execution. In California 
alone, there are more than 200 who may be affected by these changes in our 
fundamental procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee report, which Chief Justice William Rehnquist submitted 
directly to Congress in a manner that drew unprecedented criticism from most of 
the chief judges of the U.S. Courts of Appeal, would severely restrict the use 
of the writ of habeas corpus in capital cases. Speedy executions, rather than 
fairness and due process, would be the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Are we really so desperate to execute people that we can no longer afford them 
the full rights of review that condemned people have always had? Are we really 
willing to sacrifice certainty for speed where life is at stake? Are we really 
prepared to execute people who have been convicted or sentenced in violation of 
the provisions of the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
If not, someone had better tell the Congress before it enacts the Powell 
committee recommendations. Legislation that would accomplish just that is now 
on a special fast track, which would permit Congress to act before the lessons 
of common sense and history can make their weight felt. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not, as some seem to believe, whether we should turn criminals 
loose simply because courts make technical errors or admit improper evidence. 
It is whether in capital cases we can afford to ignore fundamental 
constitutional violations that may affect the jury's decision to find the 
defendant guilty or to impose a death sentence instead of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
If the error is not of constitutional magnitude or if it does not affect the 
verdict, the federal courts will not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The writ of habeas corpus, no less, is under attack by the chief justice and 
the committee he appointed. One might expect to hear the alarm bells ringing 
throughout the land. Yet only the American Bar Assn. has thus far shown any 
signs of springing into action. Its litigation section has issued a report 
calling for greater, rather than lesser, protections for the rights of those 
facing death at the hands of the state. The Bar Association itself is scheduled 
to consider the matter early next year, shortly before Congress is expected to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the significance of these attempts to limit federal-court review 
of state-imposed death sentences, one need only look back over a recent 
seven-year period. During that time, almost 75% of the orders of execution 
issued by state courts were found to be in violation of the Constitution. But 
for federal review and the writ of habeas corpus, a substantial number of 
people would have been executed in contravention of the fundamental principles 
set forth in our Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the defendant may have been innocent; in others, only the 
fairness of the sentence may have been at issue. Either way, the lesson is 
simple: Courts make mistakes -- even in capital cases. And they make them more 
frequently than we like to admit. This elementary fact should lead us all, 
supporters and opponents of the death penalty alike, to one uncontroversial 
conclusion: We must be absolutely sure that we are right before we drop the 
pellet or pull the switch. We must not deprive any human being of a fair chance 
for judicial review if a reasonable argument exists that reversal of his or her 
death penalty is required by our laws. 
</P>
<P>
This is the very principle that the Powell committee squarely and explicitly 
rejects. The committee's recommendations reflect an understandable public 
frustration over increasing crime, the narcotics threat, the slowness of the 
judicial process and our general inability to control our national and 
individual destinies. We want to strike out -- to act -- to see tangible 
results, at last. 
</P>
<P>
What is more tangible and final than an execution? And what is more difficult 
to understand than why it takes the courts so long to decide that a mass 
murderer should be executed? So, the Powell committee looked for ways to speed 
up the death-penalty process. And it found a simplistic solution. Limit the use 
of the historic writ of habeas corpus in capital cases. Afford condemned 
prisoners fewer rights than persons convicted of lesser offenses. Prohibit 
successive habeas petitions in capital cases, unlike in all other felonies. 
Adopt a rule that if a capital prisoner's lawyer fails to raise an issue in the 
state proceedings, the prisoner is barred from ever raising it in federal 
court. Adopt another rule that any issue not raised the first time the case is 
presented to a federal judge is, except in rare instances, forever waived. 
</P>
<P>
These rules might be helpful and reasonable if all lawyers were perfect. But 
lawyers, like judges, are not. Lawyers make mistakes, too. And the Powell 
committee's view is that it is the condemned man (or woman) who should pay for 
those mistakes -- with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee's report is not entirely without redeeming social value. 
For example, it encourages states to adopt procedures for the appointment of 
counsel for indigents who want to file habeas petitions in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it reaffirms the rule that prohibits condemned prisoners 
from asserting constitutional rights that the Supreme Court had not 
acknowledged as of the time the crime was committed. How much fairer and more 
sensible the view of the bar association committee: "We believe it is 
unacceptable to sanction executions under procedures that have been declared 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee met only six times. It was composed exclusively of judges 
from places in which executions are common. It heard from no witnesses, 
accepting only written comments. Yet it felt sufficiently confident of its 
views to recommend the most radical curtailment of the writ of habeas corpus in 
our history. 
</P>
<P>
It may take years before all the consequences surrounding adoption of the 
Powell committee recommendations become evident. Meanwhile, executions will 
certainly increase -- but at what cost to our Constitution?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNSEL for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, has asked the High Court
to end the five-year legal battle of Mr Lorrain Osman to avoid extradition
to Hong Kong.
Mr Osman, 60, Britain's longest-serving unconvicted prisoner, faces theft
and fraud charges. He is making his ninth application for a writ of habeas
corpus, freeing him from custody at Brixton prison in south London.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the home secretary, said Mr Osman's attempt to
avoid his removal by repeatedly applying for writs of habeas corpus and
judicial review should now end.
He said the court should allow extradition to go ahead, even if Mr Osman
launched a 10th application for a writ. Judgment was reserved.

<HEAD>American in Solitary Confinement, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANTOSH BASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALCUTTA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American member of a mysterious Hindu
cult has been held in virtual solitary confinement since her
detainment last month by the Communist-governed West Bengal state,
her lawyer said Tuesday.
   Patricia Munday, 38, of Vermont, is not receiving the necessary
medical treatment, according to a petition filed in West Bengal
Court by her attorney, Bholanath Sen. Her hometown was not
immediately known.
   ``West Bengal government does not believe in individual
liberty,'' the lawyer said.
   Munday was detained by the West Bengal police Jan. 27,
apparently for her links with a cult called the Anand Marg, or the
Path of Bliss. The governing Communist coalition is opposed to the
cult.
   Munday is being held in a private hospital in Calcutta, the
capital. She is guarded by police and journalists are not allowed
to see her. The petition asks that she be moved to a hospital in
New Delhi.
   The habeas corpus petition was filed after the Indian Supreme
Court on Friday ordered the government not to deport her. She had
appealed to the Supreme Court to secure her release.
   Habeas corpus requires a person in custody be brought before a
court. It places the burden of proof on those detaining the person
to justify the action.
   ``Ms. Munday has been kept in virtual solitary confinement. ...
She needs better medical treatment, her injuries are yet to heal,''
Sen said.
   West Bengal's advocate general, Naranarayan Goopu, said there
was no need for the court to act on the petition because a similar
writ is pending before the Supreme Court and will be heard Friday.
   Gooptu denied Munday is being held in solitary confinement,
telling the court that police ``have only restricted her movement.''
   Munday, a member of the United Nations team that won the 1981
Nobel peace prize for its work with refugees in Somalia, arrived in
India from Katmandu, Nepal, on a private visit. A mob attacked her
and an associate on Jan. 26 when they were traveling on a
motorcycle near the Anand Marg headquarters in West Bengal's
Purulia district.
   Munday suffered head injuries. The Purulia police, instead of
lodging her complaint, detained her the next day. She later was
moved to the hospital in Calcutta.
   The Anand Marg says it aims to create a social, economic and
spiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism. It
claims to have branches worldwide.

<TEXT>
   This partially evacuated city,
spared the worst of Hurricane Gilbert, became a windsurfers'
paradise as crowds turned out to ride the blustery skirts of the
giant storm.
   Boarded-up buildings and empty streets made much of Corpus
Christi seem abandoned, but Ocean Drive was jammed with traffic jam
Friday as residents and tourists flocked to the seawall after word
that Gilbert would hit farther to the south than expected.
   Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road, as
bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of
residents complaining of cabin fever in their boarded-up homes.
   ``This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Nancy Clark, a
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds here
after fleeing Port Isabel.
   Her biggest danger was the parking lot beside the beach.
   ``I was so excited when I got here and saw the waves that I
slipped down on the pavement,'' she said, rolling up her wetsuit to
display a small gash on her shin. ``This is what we wait all year
for.''
   ``This definitely rates a `10'. But it's also a good day for
conservative, positive sailing,'' said Corpus Christi architect
Robert Jones, one of about a half-dozen windsurfers who rode high
tides at 4 feet above normal levels.
   ``I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up,
getting kind of bored,'' said Jones. ``I decided I'd just get out
here and see what the winds were like.''
   Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay had heard
repeated warnings that Gilbert would likely turn toward the north,
striking land near Brownsville and bashing Corpus Christi with
heavy wind and rain.
   But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward Mexico, the
seawall swelled with confident crowds, despite warnings of flash
floods.
   ``Most people probably wouldn't expect to see this many people
down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in Corpus Christi
for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,''
said Russ Roland, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the
seawall.
   For a lot of the natives here it's seen as kind of a sign of
bravado, Roland said.
   ``We don't have this many people out here on an average day
during the summer,'' he said.
   Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the
concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning
water, mugging for cameras.
   Many, including Doug Reiter, said they just grew tired of
sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows.
   ``I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release
from being cooped up,'' he said. ``You can only take that sort of
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Thursday to do away with
``endless, endless, endless delays'' in carrying out death
sentences, handing the Bush administration a major victory in
debate on a wide-ranging anticrime bill.
   The 285-146 vote came as angry words and sarcastic cries of
`kill, kill, kill'' rang out in protest over repeated victories by
supporters of placing harsher death penalty provisions in the bill.
   ``Would it be possible to bring the guillotine directly to the
House floor?'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said with a mordant smile
after lawmakers added 12 more offenses to a growing list of federal
crimes punishable by death.
   The House also voted 257-172 to allow domestic manufacture of
semi-automatic assault rifles, whose importation has been banned by
President Bush, but only if American-made parts are used. The vote
threw out of the bill a section banning domestic manufacture of
semi-automatic weapons whose importation has been banned by the
president.
   Final passage had been expected Thursday evening, but the House
dropped the debate without a final vote in order to take up the
budget compromise.
   The measure calls for the death penalty for assassination of the
president and numerous other government officials. Treason and
espionage also would be punishable by death.
   Other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for
convicted drug offenders to a one-year prison term for illegal
possession of steroids.
   In a victory for Bush, the House voted 285-146 to replace major
provisions requiring Death Row inmates to file their habeas corpus
petitions in federal court no later than a year after exhausting
direct appeals.
   Prisoners use these petitions to claim they were denied their
constitutional rights. Some Death Row inmates have filed repeated
petitions and thus delayed their executions for more than a decade.
   Democratic sponsors of the crime bill had incorporated in the
bill a plan that, besides setting a time limit for filing
petitions, would have guaranteed prisoners competent lawyers in
capital punishment cases. It also would have limited the defendants
to one habeas corpus petition in normal circumstances.
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., a leading critic, said exceptions to
the limit would result in ``endless, endless, endless delays.''
   The House adopted instead a Hyde provision leaving the matter up
to individual state legislatures to limit the time in which their
prisoners could file habeas appeals in federal court. Conservatives
who seek to shorten delays in carrying out executions hailed the
plan while liberals blasted it.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., complained that the plan, drafted by
a commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
actually represented ``a plot ... by the chief justice'' of the
Supreme Court.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist has been pressing for changes in
the habeas corpus law.
   As it came to the floor, the bill prescribed capital punishment
for 10 groups of offenses approved by the Judiciary Committee.
   The House approved 271-159 an amendment sponsored by Rep. George
Gekas, R-Pa., calling for the death penalty for offenses ranging
from genocide to murder by mail bombing. It included murder through
terrorist bombing of an airplane, train wreck and destruction of a
motor vehicle.
   Gekas told the House that the bill needed stiffening and that
his plan was supported by a wide range of Americans ``from the cop
on the beat to the man on the street.''
   Democratic sponsors of the measure said some of its provisions
appeared unconstitutional. ``I hope we never bring up another crime
bill a month before an election,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.,
said. ``Because today we are tearing up a document that has served
us well for many years.''
   Sarcastic cries of ``kill, kill, kill'' wafted briefly from a
knot f lawmakers near a door on the Democratic side of the chamber.
   The Senate already has approved a different bill that, unlike
the House version, would curb nine semiautomatic assault weapons.
Differences will have to be resolved by a House-Senate conference
committee.
   As it became clear that the Gekas plan would be approved
overwhelmingly, tempers started to fray. Rep. Craig Washington,
D-Texas, accused Gekas of not answering his question about how the
amendment would work.
   ``Thank you for not answering my question,'' he said.
   ``Thank you for not quoting a good question,'' Gekas said.
   Washington, who had already left the microphone and taken his
seat, shouted: ``You wouldn't know a good question if you heard
it.''
   The substititute provision on semi-automatic weapons was
sponsored by Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash.
   Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based group that campaigns
for firearms restrictions, released a report to the Federal
Election Commission from Unsoeld's campaign committee, reflecting a
$4,950 contribution from the National Rifle Association shortly
after she introduced the amendment.
   The group issued a statement saying Unsoeld ``sold her political
soul to the assault weapon lobby in the hope it will help her get
reelected.''
   ``Absolute baloney,'' Unsoeld said. She said she had not
discussed the amendment with the NRA before introducing it and had
not known about the campaign contribution at the time.
   She said the amendment was needed ``because there are a lot of
us who support the Second Amendment (right to bear arms) who would
feel compelled to vote against the bill otherwise.''

   Southwest Airlines said it plans to expand the sale of airline tickets through automated teller machines in 7-Eleven stores to four Texas cities. 

   Tickets will be available from today until May 31 through about 500 automated teller machines in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Corpus Christi, according to TransFirst Corp., the operator of the MoneyMaker automated teller network. 

   The airline said it will reevaluate the program after May 31. 
If it proves successful in the new markets, Southwest probably will expand the program to additional cities. 

   Southwest said it decided to expand the program because of a successful test in Corpus Christi. 
As previously reported, Southwest began testing the concept last October. 

   Only one type of ticket -- a $15 standby fare for passengers between the ages of 18 and 21 -- will be available through the automated teller machines. 
The fare will be good for flights between Houston, Dallas and San Antonio and for flights between Houston and Corpus Christi.

   WASHINGTON -- If it's an election year, Congress must be
getting tough on crime.
   Sure enough, the Senate is expected this week to take up
the omnibus crime bill, with some of the usual suspects in
the lineup: new death-penalty provisions, curbs on the
byzantine capital-punishment appeals process, and gun
control, among others.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What's different about this year's sound and fury over
crime is the narrowing of the differences between the
parties. The Democrats have done the moving, and all of it's
to the right.
   Swept up in the martial metaphors of the "war" on drugs,
Democrats will come to the Senate floor with law-and-order
proposals they can call their own. (Electric-chair politics
haven't heated up yet in the House, but will before the end
of the year.)
   After floor speeches today, senators are scheduled to
begin battle over a hydraheaded bill introduced by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.). A blizzard of
amendments and substitutions will follow before a final vote.
Here are some of the possibilities:
   -- Death penalty. Participants across the political
spectrum agree that the final bill is likely to bring
long-dormant federal death statutes into conformity with
current Supreme Court requirements.
   The Biden package, borrowing language from conservative
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), would allow capital
punishment for 23 federal crimes. But in its current form,
the legislation wouldn't actually result in many executions.
For one thing, most of the crimes involved -- killing a
president or a Supreme Court justice, for example, or
deliberately causing a train wreck that results in death --
don't happen much.
   Also, the Biden bill comes with an amendment by Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would provide a defense
against execution in jurisdictions shown to have meted out
death sentences in a racist manner. Conservatives warn that
the amendment would do away with capital punishment, not only
at the federal level but in the 37 states where it's legal.
The reasons are the abundance of studies purporting to show
racial bias and prosecutors' huge burden of proving that
racial considerations didn't affect sentencing.
   As a result, you can expect a strong Republican effort to
strike the Kennedy amendment. In the same attack, GOP forces
are likely to try to add provisions for executing big-time
drug dealers, even in cases where prosecutors can't prove the
"kingpins" killed anybody.
   -- Death penalty appeals. Democrats have come to agree
with Republicans on the need to limit so-called habeas corpus
petitions, by which death-row residents may challenge the
constitutionality of their convictions or sentences --
typically in multiple, piecemeal federal appeals.
   In exchange for new restrictions, the Biden bill would
require states to provide lawyers who meet federal competence
standards at every stage of the criminal process. Republicans
would guarantee counsel -- if at all -- later in the appeals
process, and they wouldn't impose competence standards on the
states. More important, according to conservatives, the Biden
bill would open gaping loopholes, allowing repetitive
appeals. It would also reverse Supreme Court precedent to
allow inmates to take advantage of constitutional-law
decisions announced after their convictions.
   "I'd be surprised if 10 senators actually know the
differences" among the several conflicting habeas corpus
proposals, says one senior Democratic aide who does. The real
negotiations will take place among staff members, and the
danger in this murky area is that many lawmakers won't know
exactly what they're voting for.
   -- Gun control. The Democrats want to ban nine types of
semi-automatic weapons. Police groups and most public opinion
polls back such steps. The National Rifle Association
doesn't. The assault-weapons provision has a perilous future.
   -- Exclusionary rule. This judge-made rule barring use of
unconstitutionally gathered evidence, long an election-year
favorite, so far has been overshadowed by the death penalty
and habeas corpus debates. Part of the reason is that
Democratic protectors of the rule have given so much ground.
   The Biden bill would codify a major exception carved out
by the Supreme Court, which held in 1984 that where police
rely in "good faith" on a faulty search warrant, a judge may
admit the evidence found. Conservatives will try to extend
the exception for good-faith police violations to warrantless
searches, among other circumstances.
   One side-effect of the Biden approach, much appreciated by
otherwise bruised-and-reeling civil libertarians: Turning the
Supreme Court decision into a statute would inhibit the
justices from attempting further erosion of the exclusionary
rule.

<HEAD>Senator Says Girl Scouts' Cookie Crunch Resolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipment of 402 boxes of Girl Scout cookies
will finally reach sailors aboard the USS Midway after being
blocked once by Japanese officials and returned to Corpus Christi,
Texas.
   ``That's good news for our sailors and for the Brownies from
Troop 807,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Monday while
announcing that the dispute with Japanee customs officials had been
resolved.
   Bentsen said the cookies should be on their way sometime today
now that Japanese officials have relented.
   Japanese customs officials initially blocked the shipment of
cookies from the Brownie troop in Corpus Christi and assessed a
$2,000 duty fee, which Brownie officials said was too steep for the
children.
   The cookies were shipped April 26, then spent four days in a
Japanese customs warehouse before being returned to the airport in
Corpus Christi.
   Thirty-five servicemen aboard the aircraft carrier had ordered
cookies from the Brownies, who had sent the men Christmas cards and
a Valentine's Day box of candy.
   The Midway's home port is Atsugi, Japan.

<HL> The Hungry Enemy Within

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   A good half of this society is on a diet at any particular time, or so it would seem from the weekly short ton of advertising for weight-loss programs and spas. 

   Seems a lot of fuss and nonsense, not to mention heavy expense. 
I have an alternative, no-cost dieting plan based on military procedure and a siege mentality. 

   PERSONNEL: The brain, of course, is commander in chief -- all parts of the body report to it anyway. 
All personnel under Gen. Brain have equal status, with the rank of corporeal. 

   ENEMY: The alimentary system. 
Your first surprise, most likely, as you probably thought food was the enemy. 
No, it's mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestines, with their unrelenting demands, that constitute the foe. 
All other personnel -- cells, veins and arteries, blood, muscles, bones, tissue, et al. -- are of the body. 
The alimentary forces are not of the body -- they run right through the body's basically peaceful coalition like a blitzkrieg battalion, causing disruption, pain and ruin. 
However, as they are necessary for the body's nutrition and survival, they are an enemy to be subdued, not destroyed. 

   DAY 1: Begins with reveille, while corpus is still recumbent in barracks. 

   GEN. BRAIN: We have a war to fight. 
We're being surrounded by fat. 
Just what the "alimenies" want -- the more fat, the more food it takes to keep it there, the more the alimenies get to eat. 
Once that fat gets up here to your general, we're done for. 

   Starting today, we're on combat alert. 
We'll be limited to calories necessary to drive the body during the day's activities. 
The alimenies won't react at first, thinking it's the usual empty threat. 

   (Later that night, all personnel are at ease as body prepares for taps. 
Immediately after lights out, alimentary forces react: Stomach sends Gen. Brain an image of tomato-and-cheese pizza slices and a Whopper Junior; mouth adds signals of how great pizzas and Whoppers taste.) 

   GEN. BRAIN: Attention. 
Remain calm. 
This is a reconnaissance action only. 
The pizza had no anchovies and the Whopper was plain. 
Everyone go to sleep. 

   DAY 2: Because of the previous day's performance in the field, orders are not given until after reveille and breakfast of black coffee, juice and plain toast. 

   GEN. BRAIN: Attention all personnel. 
Now the tough get going. 
Casualty figures among tissue cells, especially in subcutaneous units, are expected to be high starting today and to increase daily as the war intensifies. 
Your sacrifice is for the good of all. 
Remember our battle cry: Totum Corpus non Obesitas! 

   (Early in the evening of Day 2, the alimentary forces, suspecting a major offensive, respond in kind: Stomach begins heavy contractions, intestines develop gas, mouth salivates at anything that's not cardboard, metal or wood. 
Body experiences pain and exhaustion; personnel begin to question war's necessity.) 

   GEN. BRAIN: Now hear this. 
Enemy action under way. 
We will respond with heavy ingestion of fruit juice, carrots and celery. 
Following ingestion, lights out. 

   DAY 3: Same breakfast as day before. 
The general has not spoken yet, but there is tension among all units. 

   GEN. BRAIN: Attention. 
This is your general. (Long, silent pause; all personnel, down to the tiniest squamous cells, are alert and anxious.) 
Last night at approximately 2300 hours, two creme-filled Devil Dogs penetrated our defenses and got into the system. 
Weigh-in will indicate previous day's gains were lost . . . or vice-versa. 
Full-force counteroffensive commences immediately. 
All units will receive rations of vegetables, whole grains, dried apricots and three quarts of water. 

   (By 1300 hours, fresh rations restore order to sucrose-intoxicated cells in subcutaneous units. 
But alimenies strike back at 1700 hours with dysentery. 
Body retreats to porcelain as internal battle rages.) 

   GEN. BRAIN: All units remain calm. 
Commence stabilizing maneuver. 

   (Alimenies demand Kentucky Fried Chicken extra crispy; they get pita bread, butter and bananas. 
Calorie count rises slightly, but maneuver stops dysentery.) 

   During the next few days, the corpus becomes battle-hardened as the alimenies shrink and as it realizes it can work and play just as well on 1,800 sensible calories as on 4,000 pleasurable ones. 
Once the alimenies are firmly neutralized, the commander in chief addresses his troops. 

   GEN. BRAIN: Never have so many been reduced to so few. 
But we must be constantly vigilant. 
It is springtime, and from back-yard barbecue pits and sidewalk cafes come the virulent vapors of frying fat. 
Our slender victory is ever weighed in the balance.

   A former employee of R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. who traded on stocks mentioned in Business Week prior to the magazine's publication pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and perjury. 

   The former senior sales representative, Shayne A. Walters, admitted in federal court in New York that he conspired to commit mail and wire fraud and to trade on material non-public information from 1986 to 1988. 
R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons prints Business Week for McGraw-Hill Inc., the magazine's publisher. 

   Mr. Walters also admitted to committing perjury when he testified before the Securities and Exchange Commission in March. 
The SEC's civil suit against Mr. Walters was settled when he agreed to pay $62,000 in restitution and civil penalties -- double his illegal profit. 

   Mr. Walters, 32 years old, said he and his co-conspirators traded on securities mentioned in Business Week's "Inside Wall Street" column prior to the magazine's distribution to the general public. 
He told U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. that he woke up at 3:45 in the morning on Thursdays to make the 45-mile drive to Donnelley's Torrance, Calif., printing plant to pick up a copy of the magazine. 

   He then gave the magazine to a stockbroker, who wasn't identified, who purchased the securities. 
Two of the securities Mr. Walters purchased illegally were TriStar Pictures Inc. in October 1986 and Newmark &amp; Lewis Inc. in July 1988. 

   The government said Mr. Walters has been cooperating with the goverment in its continuing investigation of the trades. 
Mr. Walters is scheduled to be sentenced April 24. 
He faces a maximum sentence of five-years imprisonment and $250,000 fines on each of the two counts. 

   A former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. broker, William Dillon, and a former broadcast editor at Business Week, S.G. Ruderman, previously pleaded guilty to charges involving trading on information gleened from unreleased copies of Business Week. 
They were given six-month sentences.

   PANEL OF FEDERAL JUDGES urges limits on appeals by death-row inmates. 

   But civil-liberties groups say the proposal by a five-judge panel appointed by Chief Justice of the U.S. William Rehnquist is unfair. 

   The current death-penalty system in the states has led to "repetitious" appeals and "years of delay," according to a report by the panel. 
"The resulting lack of finality undermines public confidence in our criminal-justice system." 

   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, who led the panel, said in a briefing: "It just isn't working." 

   The judges recommended the system be streamlined to routinely allow death-row inmates only one trip through state and federal courts in "habeas corpus." 
Habeas corpus is a civil matter in which inmates, who were convicted and whose criminal appeals were denied, claim that their rights were violated during their arrest or prosecution. 
Many death-row inmates currently go through state and federal courts several times before being executed. 

   The panel said a major problem is that death-row inmates don't have good lawyers to handle their cases after conviction. 
The judges suggested a trade-off: States that provide lawyers for death-row inmates would be able to take advantage of the proposed tough limits on the number and amount of time allowed for habeas-corpus appeals, while other states would continue to face multiple appeals. 

   But civil-liberties groups said the proposal is aimed only at speeding up executions, and not at ensuring fairness for inmates. 
Dick Burr of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said the panel failed to propose any standards for the quality of lawyers to be provided by the states. 
"This provides a facade of legal counsel, a travesty that has existed for a long, long time," he said. 

   An American Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman said the proposal means the federal courts would ignore "the extraordinary rate of error" in death-penalty cases, "misconduct of state prosecutors and police" and "attorney incompetence." 
The courts, she said, "will do everything possible to facilitate the rush to the gallows." 

   The panel's report, in the form of proposed legislation for action by Congress, must first be considered next March by the Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal courts. 
The 28-member conference deferred action yesterday so the judges may consult their district- and appeals-court colleagues. 

   Even Justice Powell had mixed feelings. 
"My own very strong view is that if we can't make it work, we ought to abolish capital punishment," he said.

   DRUG PROSECUTIONS mushroom in the federal courts. 

   Statistics for the caseloads of federal district courts show that drug prosecutions increased 15% for the year ended June 30, compared with the previous year. 
The number of drug-law prosecutions increased to 11,855 from 10,291 the previous year. 
The number of drug cases in the past decade has almost quadrupled. 

   The statistics, released by the Administrative Office of the Federal Courts, illustrate how drug cases are consuming federal-court resources. 
If drug cases are excluded from the total, the number of new criminal prosecutions by the federal government declined slightly last year for the second-consecutive year, to 33,036 from 33,212. 

   The number of civil cases in district courts fell 2.6%, to 233,293 from 239,634, largely because of a drop in Social Security claims cases and in government suits to recover overpaid veterans' benefits. 

   Another big jump for the federal courts was in the number of appeals in criminal cases, accounting for virtually the entire increase in the workload of the federal appeals courts. 
The administrative office said much of the increase may be attributed to appeals of criminal sentences, authorized by the tough, new federal sentencing law that took effect in 1987, and was upheld by the Supreme Court in January. 

   The total number of new appeals increased 5.9% to 39,734 from 37,524. 
The number of criminal appeals included in those totals rose 33%, to 8,020 from 6,012. 

   One bright spot: Bankruptcy-court filings by businesses declined 9%. 
But the number of bankruptcy cases filed by individuals rose 10%.

   SUIT SEEKS equal insurance benefits for manic depression. 

   The suit alleges that Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America and the Travelers Insurance Co. of Illinois unit of Travelers Corp. improperly reduced insurance benefits for victims of manic depression by defining it as a mental disorder. 
The complaint says both companies are aware that medical experts consider manic depression to be a physical disorder of the brain. 

   The class-action suit was filed this week by two anonymous plaintiffs and the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association of Chicago in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. 
It is believed to be the first class-action suit of its kind. 

   Edward Kane, general counsel for Guardian, said his company has never before been sued under its mental-illness exclusion. 
A Travelers spokesman said this was the first time his company was sued on this issue. 
Both declined further comment because they hadn't seen the suit. 

   In 1987, an appellate court in Arkansas ruled in favor of an individual who had been denied insurance payments for manic depression by a Blue Cross and Blue Shield office, said Robert Gettleman of D'Ancona &amp; Pflaum, a lawyer for the plaintiff class. 
"Manic depression is a disease of the brain. 
Companies shouldn't view it any differently than a disease of the heart or of the liver," Mr. Gettleman said.

   A LETTER SIGNED by 511 constitutional-law professors arrived in Sen. Joseph Biden's (D., Del.) office yesterday urging the Judiciary Committee he heads to oppose a constitutional amendment banning flag burning. 
His panel sent such an amendment to the Senate floor with the recommendation that it not pass. 
The panel also approved a statute, sponsored by Sen. Biden, that would outlaw flag desecration. 
The professors' letter was silent on the statute, which has become something of a political hot potato among constitutional scholars. 
They are divided into two camps: those who oppose both a constitutional amendment and a statute and those who oppose an amendment, but believe a statute would be held constitutional by the Supreme Court. 
It is an interesting split, particularly at Harvard Law School, where Charles Fried, the Reagan administration solicitor general, is in the former group and Laurence Tribe, a liberal, is in the latter.

   MOTORISTS STOPPED in Texas on suspicion of drunk driving don't have a constitutional right to talk to a lawyer before taking a breathalyzer test, the state's highest criminal court ruled. 
Under Texas law, drivers who refuse the test can lose their licenses for as long as 90 days. 
Lawyers say that in recent years courts in other states have roughly split on the right-to-counsel issue, although historically most have denied the right. 
Such cases often turn on whether the decision to submit to the blood-alcohol test can be considered a "critical" stage in the criminal process. 
In its 7-2 decision, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said the critical stage doesn't begin until formal charges are brought against a suspect.

<LEADPARA>  The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear an appeal from a Virginia death row
prisoner, despite objections from three justices who said he may be innocent.;
  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who usually sides with law enforcement in

sentenced to death, O'Dell's substantial federal claims can, and should,
receive careful consideration from the federal court with . . . jurisdiction
over the case," wrote Justice Harry Blackmun, who was joined by Justices John
Paul Stevens and O'Connor.;   One vote too few;   The appeal fell a vote short
of the four required for a Supreme Court hearing. The majority did not explain
why the petition was spurned.;   Their denial was representative of the
conservative court's continuing efforts to limit federal habeas corpus, a
complex and controversial legal procedure that enables inmates to go to the
federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of their state convictions
and sentences.;   Supporters of strictly limited habeas corpus rights argue
that death row inmates have used repeated appeals to delay their executions
for an average of eight years. Backers of less limited rights cite statistics
showing that federal judges have found serious constitutional errors requiring
reversal of nearly 40 percent of death penalty cases brought before them.;  
Unable to get to court;   So far, O'Dell, 49, of Roanoke, Va., who
consistently has asserted his innocence, has been unable to get into federal
court.;   His lawyer says that, contrary to other tests produced at O'Dell's
trial, DNA tests prove that blood found on his clothing -- a key piece of
evidence against him -- cannot be linked to the blood of the murder victim.
O'Dell claims that his clothing was bloodied in an unrelated barroom brawl.;  
O'Dell argues that he should not have been allowed to represent himself and
that he should have been allowed to try to prove that a fellow inmate, who
testified that O'Dell had confessed in prison, had offered to manufacture
evidence in other trials to avoid imprisonment.;   O'Dell made headlines last
summer when he asked that his sperm be frozen and used to inseminate his
girlfriend.  </TEXT>

  [Excerpts] We are going to start by repeating what we have 
time and again said here over the past few days: We are going 
through a tense social situation, which is marked by not 
entirely successful attempts to set up roadblocks. There is, 
above all, an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. Workers 
have clashed with government forces on the streets using the 
technique of organizing in cell-style picketing groups. There 
are talks under way aimed at starting negotiations between the 
government and the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB], but no 
progress has yet been made in addressing substantive issues. 
While the situation is not new, it is worrisome just the same. 
  Violence took hold on the streets of La Paz this afternoon. 
Union leaders, policemen, and even common criminals participated 
in acts of violence. 
  The COB rally scheduled for this afternoon in San Francisco 
Square was not held. Police took positions over the entire city 
of La Paz, and prevented every form of street protest. As soon 
as a group of workers began to convene, police were already 
dispersing them. 
  Demonstrators moved toward the northern part of the city, 
where they continued to fight police personnel. Dozens of 
people were arrested. 
  The situation was altogether different at the Lima police 
precinct. There the ones who were surrounded were the 
policemen. The actions there were in no way related to the COB 
social struggle, let alone with the struggle waged by the unions 
of rural and urban teachers, who in recent times have often 
taken to the streets of La Paz. In this case, common criminals 
surrounded the Lima precinct to release their fellow criminals 
who were being held at the precinct. [passage omitted] 
  The criminals managed to open the cell, but there was only 
one prisoner there. Their next move was to try to hang the 
policemen, who locked themselves up in the precinct office. 
[passage omitted] 
  Finally, reinforcements managed to rescue the Lima precinct 
police personnel. 
  Disturbances in La Paz continued until very late. The 
demonstrators damaged several buses. You are now watching a 
clip of (Higuino Square), where the police dispersed one of the 
many groups of demonstrators and cleared the street for traffic. 
  No one was spared from the acts of violence on Peru Avenue, 
not even reporters. Three journalists and a press car were 
attacked this afternoon by rural teachers on Peru Avenue, where 
window panes were shattered and the windshields of cars and 
buses were broken. [passage omitted] 
  This time the demonstrators acted in small groups, giving no 
quarter to police. The clip you are watching took place near 
the court house, where the air was filled with tear gas. In the 
meantime, the last eight people still under arrest for breaking 
windshields and windows during the rural teachers demonstration 
on 22 April requested that the Fourth Criminal Court judge set 
them free during a habeas corpus hearing. Judge Lidia Molina 
upheld their request, and ordered that they all be released. 
[passage omitted] 
  The rural teachers have announced that they will file 
another 
habeas corpus petition to obtain the release of those arrested 
this afternoon.

   Three people were missing from a
private, single-engine plane that crashed into the Gulf of Mexico
Wednesday night, Coast Guard officials said.
   The Cessna 210 with four people aboard went down about 30 miles
south of Palacios at 8:27 p.m. while en route from Brownsville to
Houston, said Petty Officer Steve Guy at Coast Guard district
headquarters in New Orleans.
   A man who was in the plane swam to a nearby oil platform and was
talking by cellular telephone to a Coast Guard duty officer in
Galveston, said Petty Officer Clifton Vigus in Corpus Christi. The
Coast Guard was trying to pinpoint the location of the platform and
rescue craft had been dispatched.
   The other three people were unaccounted for, Vigus said.
   Palacios is a coastal community about halfway between Corpus
Christi and Galveston.

<F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves, Second Edition" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] 
has discovered links between drug-trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera and subversive organizations in Alto Huallaga. 
  Chavez, alias El Vaticano, was presented to the local and 
foreign media a few minutes ago wearing the characteristic 
striped attire in which terrorists are presented. Chavez' shirt 
had the number 1891 and he appeared very briefly -- 10 seconds 
-- before the media. 
  Dincote Commander Hugo Sayers Calderon illustrated the links 
between the drug trafficker and the subversive organizations. 
He reported that Chavez had provided weapons to the terrorists 
and had built a rural road at Campanilla. 
  Juan Lazarte Luna, who was Chavez's lawyer until noon today, 
formally announced that he would not defend the drug trafficker 
because, he said, he has too much work. He declared, however, 
that he will continue to defend Demetrio Chavez' sister, Berta 
Chavez, who is scheduled to be released tomorrow. Lazarte also 
reported that Fausto Parra will continue the drug terrorist's 
defense for all pending charges against him. 
  Television host Susan Leon, who is being held at the police 
station women's section for her alleged involvement in the El 
Vaticano case, will be released in the coming hours. Her 
lawyer, Mario Rodriguez Hurtado, presented a habeas corpus 
appeal, which the 5th Arraignment Court has to respond to within 
24 hours. Upon receiving the habeas corpus, 5th Arraignment 
Court Judge Carmen Rojari visited Susan Leon in jail where she 
has been held for the last four days. 
  Also, hair stylist Segundo Gonzales, alias Chocco, who has 
been held at the Dirandro [General Narcotics Directorate] 
headquarters for the last five days, will be released today or 
tomorrow. His lawyer, Rosa del Corral, reported that El 
Vaticano himself had testified that his friendship with the hair 
stylist was only based on the latter's profession. 
  Former Miss World Lucila Boggiano de Zoeger's situation, 
however, is still unknown. She is currently at the Estela Maris 
Clinic where she had to be admitted last Monday. Comedian 
Andres Hurtado, alias Chibolin, and his wife, Marilu Montiel, 
are also under arrest on charges of alleged links to the El 
Vaticano case.

   Healthcare International Inc., an Austin, Texas, hospital
management company operating under bankruptcy-court
protection, said two of its units filed bankruptcy petitions
after a landlord tried to terminate two leases in Corpus
Christi, Texas.
   The company said that Safecare Co., the landlord at its
Bayview psychiatric hospital, notified it that Safecare had
terminated the leases for the hospital and a medical office
building, and had arranged for a Columbia Hospital Corp.
affiliate to take over the facilities effective Feb. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Healthcare said it refused to relinquish possession of the
68-bed hospital and adjoining office building and sought
Chapter 11 protection for its Healthcare Corpus Christi Inc.
and Bayview Management Co. units. Healthcare, which said it
didn't receive prior notice of the terminations, said its
rents are current and that it intends to contest Safecare's
move.
   Healthcare and certain nonoperating subsidiaries filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in
Austin last November.

<HEAD>Conservative Rebellion Derails Crime Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders are trying to revive a
major crime bill that conservatives derailed in a protest over
death penalty provisions they said are too weak.
   ``This is a travesty,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
said Tuesday as he and other conservatives fought the measure on
the House floor. They said it needed stricter provisions to end
excessive delays in carrying out death sentences.
   The conservatives, who usually lack enough support to win such
fights in Democratic-controlled House, managed to defeat, 258-166,
a rule that would have barred the House from considering a tighter
version of the death penalty provision.
   The vote forced Democratic leaders to pull the bill from the
floor after only brief debate and search for a new procedure that
would withstand any such attack.
   It was a bad day on the anti-crime issue for House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash. He also came under fire from police lobbying
groups over a separate provision barring consideration of an
amendment to increase controls on handguns.
   The overall anti-crime package calls for the death penalty for
10 federal crimes, ranging from assassination of the president to
espionage. It would allow courts to consider evidence gathered with
flawed search warrants if police had acted ``in good faith.''
   A major controversy is brewing over ``habeas corpus'' provisions
designed to end delays of a decade or more in carrying out
executions while the condemned file repeated appeals claiming they
were treated in an unconstitutional manner.
   The bill is designed to limit death row inmates to one such
petition in many cases to be filed no later than one year after
their other appeals are exhausted. The Bush administration and
conservatives led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., say however that
it needs to be far stronger.
   As it stands, the bill would ``reduce the degree of finality of
convictions by weakening procedures relating to habeas corpus,''
the administration said in a statement Tuesday.
   The administration also called for approval of warrantless
searches if police acted in good faith and it attacked a provision
of the House bill that would enable convicts to use racial
statistics as a basis for appealing death sentences.
   Defenders of the bill said it could be improved but that it did
provide not only powerful weapons for police in the war against
crime but ones that could win approval on Capitol Hill.
   ``It puts more arrows in the quiver of law enforcement,'' said
Rep. Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky. But there were many Democratic
defectors.
   Meanwhile, police groups said at a news conference that controls
on semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns are needed if police
are to be effective in fighting crime.
   ``Should we wait until the blood of law enforcement officers and
peaceful citizens is running in the halls of Congress before we
pass sensible gun legislation?'' asked Fraternal Order of Police
leader Dewey Stokes.
   The police groups criticized a Rules Committee decision Monday
barring consideration of an amendment that would require a
seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
   ``Right now, Speaker Foley is not permitting the (amendment) to
come to a vote on the floor of the House, so who else can we
blame?'' Stokes said.
   Foley's spokesman, Jeff Biggs, noted the House Judiciary
Committee had approved the anti-crime package and the handgun bill
as separate measures and said the speaker often goes along with the
wishes of committee chairmen. He also said that Foley had not ruled
out consideration of the gun bill as a separate item.

newscast] 
  [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] 
has discovered links between drug-trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera and subversive organizations in Alto Huallaga. 
  Chavez, alias El Vaticano, was presented to the local and 
foreign media a few minutes ago wearing the characteristic 
striped attire in which terrorists are presented. Chavez' shirt 
had the number 1891 and he appeared very briefly--10 
seconds--before the media. 
  Dincote Commander Hugo Sayers Calderon illustrated the links 
between the drug trafficker and the subversive organizations. 
He reported that Chavez had provided weapons to the terrorists 
and had built a rural road at Campanilla. 
  Juan Lazarte Luna, who was Chavez's lawyer until noon today, 
formally announced that he would not defend the drug trafficker 
because, he said, he has too much work. He declared, however, 
that he will continue to defend Demetrio Chavez' sister, Berta 
Chavez, who is scheduled to be released tomorrow. Lazarte also 
reported that Fausto Parra will continue the drug terrorist's 
defense for all pending charges against him. 
  Television host Susan Leon, who is being held at the police 
station women's section for her alleged involvement in the El 
Vaticano case, will be released in the coming hours. Her 
lawyer, Mario Rodriguez Hurtado, presented a habeas corpus 
appeal, which the 5th Arraignment Court has to respond to within 
24 hours. Upon receiving the habeas corpus, 5th Arraignment 
Court Judge Carmen Rojari visited Susan Leon in jail where she 
has been held for the last four days. 
  Also, hair stylist Segundo Gonzales, alias Chocco, who has 
been held at the Dirandro [General Narcotics Directorate] 
headquarters for the last five days, will be released today or 
tomorrow. His lawyer, Rosa del Corral, reported that El 
Vaticano himself had testified that his friendship with the hair 
stylist was only based on the latter's profession. 
  Former Miss World Lucila Boggiano de Zoeger's situation, 
however, is still unknown. She is currently at the Estela Maris 
Clinic where she had to be admitted last Monday. Comedian 
Andres Hurtado, alias Chibolin, and his wife, Marilu Montiel, 
are also under arrest on charges of alleged links to the El 
Vaticano case.

FT  12 AUG 93 / Clinton gun-control plan: Anti-crime proposals would limit
appeals against execution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a broad set of proposals to combat
crime, with measures to control gun sales, hire more policemen and limit
appeals against the death penalty.
Mr Clinton promised to introduce a crime bill into Congress next month
offering Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to put up to 50,000 more police
officers on the beat, and called the proposals a 'major down payment' on his
campaign promise to use the power of the White House to prevent and punish
crime.
The package would also bring tighter controls on gun sales, including a new
drive to pass the Brady bill, which would require a five-day waiting period
before the purchase of a handgun.
'We must end the insanity of being able to buy or sell a handgun more easily
than obtaining a driver's licence,' Mr Clinton said.
The Brady bill, named after a former White House press secretary who was
shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, is now
widely supported by police chiefs, although few of them believe it would do
much to stem the availability of illegal weapons to criminals.
Mr Clinton ordered immediate executive action to ban the import of
assault-style handguns, and to tighten controls on the issue of licences for
gun dealers.
Current rules allow 280,000 people to sell guns under scant government
supervision, most of them working from home, in exchange for a fee of
Dollars 10 a year.
The proposed crime package also contains measures to extend the death
penalty, mostly applied at the state level, to a number of federal crimes,
and to limit prisoners sentenced to death by a state court to a single
habeas corpus appeal to the federal courts.
Although capital punishment was reauthorised by the Supreme Court in 1976,
and is widely supported in US public opinion, 15 times as many prisoners are
sentenced to death each year as are in fact executed.
The Supreme Court has become less and less receptive to appeals from death
row prisoners, but some state law enforcement officials still complain that
the appeals process can drag on for years.
Many of the measures proposed by Mr Clinton yesterday were contained in
crime legislation passed in 1991 and 1992 by both chambers of Congress, but
eventually blocked by Senate Republicans who wanted much tougher curbs on
habeas corpus rights.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Sidesteps Jury Issue in Illinois Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today sidestepped deciding
whether a criminal defendant's right to be tried by his peers is
violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their
race.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices ruled against Frank D. Teague,
sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago
supermarket and for the attempted murder of police officers shot
after the robbery.
   Four justices _ one vote short of the majority needed to set
binding legal precedent _ said Teague should not be allowed to raise
the representative-jury issue.
   The four, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said federal courts
should not establish new constitutional guidelines when ruling on
so-called habeas corpus appeals by criminal defendants.
   Such appeals attack a defendant's state court conviction or
sentence on grounds that federal constitutional rights were
violated. The appeals always follow unsuccessful state court appeals
by the defendants.
   The justices in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may disqualify
potential jurors based on their race. The court said such tactics
violate equal-protection rights.
   But a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive effect
of the 1986 ruling. The court said previously that the 1986 ruling
does not apply to convicted criminals who, like Teague, had
exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to when the 1986
ruling was announced.
   Teague's habeas corpus appeal did not raise the equal-protection
issue, but instead attacked a prosecutor's exclusion of 10 potential
black jurors on grounds that it violated Teague's right to a jury
selected from a cross-section of the community.
   Teague, who is black, was convicted in 1978 by an all-white jury.
   If Teague were to win on the fair cross-section challenge, he
would be entitled to a new trial even though the high court's 1986
ruling came too late to help him.
   Past Supreme Court rulings have applied the Sixth Amendment's
fair cross-section requirement to pools of potential jurors but not
to juries actually selected.
   O'Connor said the court should not decide whether the fair
cross-section requirement applies to selected juries as well because
that ruling could not apply to Teague.
   Her opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens
also voted to uphold Teague's conviction but for differing reasons.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   The case is Teague vs. Lane, 87-5259.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court upheld Labor Department
regulations that make it tougher for several thousand coal
miners or their families to be eligible for black-lung
disability benefits.
   The 7-1 decision, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, will
make it easier for coal companies to defend themselves
against as many as 3,500 miners' disability claims, valued at
as much as $650 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling resolved a dispute over claims filed between
1973 and 1980 by workers who said they were disabled by lung
disease resulting from prolonged exposure to coal dust, or by
the families of workers who died after such exposure. These
disability claims, to be paid by coal companies, are reviewed
by the Labor Department.
   The legal issue was whether coal companies may avoid
paying disability claims only by proving that miners were or
are still capable of doing their mine work, or whether
companies may present other evidence, such as medical
problems that aren't mine-related.
   The federal appeals courts were divided over how many
defenses Congress allowed to the coal companies. The high
court yesterday deferred to the Labor Department's assertion
that Congress meant for the coal companies to have some
flexibility in fending off black-lung claims, which are
generally easier to prove than more-traditional disability
claims.
   The court ruled in two separate appeals. In one, the high
court affirmed the ruling of a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia, and in the other, it reversed the ruling of a
federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. Justice Antonin Scalia
dissented, saying the Labor Department regulations weren't a
plausible interpretation of federal benefits law. Justice
Anthony Kennedy didn't vote in the case.
   The companies involved in the high court decision were:
BethEnergy Mines Inc., a Bethlehem Steel Corp. unit;
Clinchfield Coal Co., a unit of Pittston Cos.; and
Consolidation Coal Co., a Du Pont Co. unit. (Pauley vs.
BethEnergy Mines Inc.; Clinchfield Coal Co. vs. Director,
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs; Consolidation Coal
Co. vs. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs)
                                                                                                       

   Nuclear Plants
                                                                                                       

   The justices left intact a Maine state court ruling that
federal, not state, law governs the cost and process of
decommissioning a nuclear power plant to take it out of
service.
   The Maine Supreme Court ruled in October 1990 that federal
law pre-empts a 1982 state law regulating the conditions for
decommissioning nuclear plants when their licenses have
expired. Federal law gives federal agencies authority to be
certain that nuclear plants have reserve funds to pay for
taking plants out of active service when their licenses
expire and that their nuclear material must be removed.
   The Maine Public Utilities Commission objected to a plan
submitted by Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission for charging customers the
estimated future costs of decommissioning the Maine Yankee.
The Maine Yankee plan, approved by the FERC, calls for a
reserve fund of $167 million, in annual payments of
$9,070,000. The state regulators said the fund should be $178
million, in annual payments of $9,790,000.
   But the state supreme court ruled that the Maine
regulators couldn't interfere with the funds set by federal
officials. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal
by state regulators.
   Other utilities, including Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire and New England Power Co., own Maine Yankee. (Maine
Public Utilities Commission vs. Maine Yankee Atomic Power
Co.)
                                                                                                       

   Criminal Appeals
                                                                                                       

   The high court further curtailed the ability of people
convicted of murder or other crimes in state court to
challenge the constitutionality of their convictions in
federal court.
   The case involved habeas corpus, a civil lawsuit most
often filed by a convict whose appeals have been rejected. A
habeas corpus petition typically argues that the inmate's
rights were violated during the arrest or trial. The Supreme
Court in the past few years has expressed concern at abuse of
the system by inmates who file one habeas petition after
another, and the justices have tried to limit the number of
such petitions and time in which they can be filed.
   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the high
court, by a 6-3 vote, erected new procedural obstacles to
federal courts' consideration of inmates' first habeas
petitions. The decision makes it tougher for inmates who
violate state court habeas procedures to then file in federal
court.
   The decision appeared to overrule finally a 1963 ruling
that markedly opened up federal court review of state
criminal convictions. The 1963 ruling has been eroded by the
high court in the past 15 years, but never overruled.
   Justice Blackmun dissented, joined by Justices Thurgood
Marshall and John Stevens. (Coleman vs. Thompson)

FT  22 APR 92 / California action may prompt rise in US executions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA carried out its first execution for 25 years yesterday, raising
fears among opponents of capital punishment of a wave of executions across
the US.
Robert Alton Harris was gassed to death in front of 49 witnesses at San
Quentin prison after a series of reversals in which a federal appeals court
four times stayed his execution, and was four times overruled by the Supreme
Court in Washington.
The Supreme Court overturned the fourth and final stay, which was issued
after Harris had been strapped in the gas chamber, and ordered the lower
courts not to file any more stays without the high court's permission.
After this ruling, Harris was hastily returned to the chamber for the last
time, looking sombre but winking at one guard. Harris was executed for
murdering two teenagers in 1978.
The state of California has often set political and social trends for the
US. It not only has the second-largest number of convicted prisoners facing
death - 328 after Harris's execution - but has also been the scene of a
vigorous public debate, as conservative politicians attacked the liberal
state judges appointed by Mr Jerry Brown, a contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination, when he was governor in the late 1970s.
Popular support for the death penalty as a punishment for murder has almost
doubled since the mid-1960s, when it fell to about 40 per cent. Nine
executions in 10 have taken place in the southern states. Black prisoners
have received a disproportionate number of death sentences.
Although the death penalty has been brandished by politicians as a weapon
against rising crime, it is rarely carried out.
Only 169 executions have been carried out since 1976. At the current rate,
15 times this number of new prisoners arrive on 'death row' each year.
The Bush administration last year tried to pass legislation making it easier
to carry out a death sentence by weakening the habeas corpus protections
which enable prisoners to delay execution with seemingly endless appeals.
The Democratic-controlled Congress responded by proposing to extend the
death penalty to 50 federal crimes - a largely irrelevant gesture which
covered such offences as the murder of a federal egg inspector. However, the
extension was also intended to curb indiscriminate sale of guns.
President George Bush then threatened to veto the entire bill, partly
because he claimed it would tie the hands of policemen and prosecutors by
further extending habeas corpus protection, but also partly because of his
opposition to gun controls.
The resulting stalemate has blocked any federal crime legislation, leaving
states to press ahead with their own solutions.

<HEAD>Four Roman Catholic Bishops Meet With Married, Former Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Roman Catholic bishops held a
cordial but noncommittal meeting with a delegation of former
priests who were stripped of their duties because they married and
who want to return to work.
   The hour-long exchange came Saturday during a retreat for about
200 members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   ``They listened and took notes,'' said Terry Dosh, one of five
former priests at the meeting. ``None of us got our hopes up that
anything could happen immediately. We're realists.''
   The four bishops, including Pierre Dumaine of the San Jose
Diocese, agreed to take the request to their national committees
for further discussion. At least one bishop appeared to support the
former priests' cause.
   ``Within the framework of the discipline of the church, which
has served the church well over the centuries, these men should be
encouraged to put their life experience at the church's service,''
Bishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh said in a prepared statement.
   The former priests are members of a Minneapolis-based group
called CORPUS, or the Corps of Reserve Priests United for Service,
which held an annual meeting over the weekend at San Jose State
University.
   The group claims about 10,000 members, about half of them
priests who married and are no longer allowed to serve.
   The meeting with the bishops was the first since the 1978
election of Pope John Paul II, who opposes letting married priests
or women celebrate Mass or perform other priestly duties.
   CORPUS President Anthony Padovano said the group tried before to
meet with bishops without success. CORPUS hopes the church will
reconsider the ban on married priests this fall at an international
meeting of bishops in Rome.
   Despite its insistence on a celibate clergy, the church in
recent years has allowed married Episcopal priests to convert to
Roman Catholicism, remain married and celebrate Mass, hear
confessions and perform other priestly duties.
   ``That's a double standard,'' said Guy Murning, who was ordained
as a Roman Catholic priest in 1970 but left eight years later to
get married.

<TEXT>
   Vacationers fled Gulf Coast beaches
Thursday, property owners boarded up homes and businesses, and
emergenc workers filled sandbags and readied shelters as powerful
Hurricane Gilbert took aim at the southern tip of Texas.
   Tens of thousands of schoolchildren from Brownsville to Corpus
Christi were given an unexpected holiday so families would have
time to evacuate, and northbound highways were jammed Thursday
afternoon.
   By 11 p.m., the center of Gilbert was about 275 miles southeast
of Brownsville and a torrential rain was falling. The storm, with
maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, was expected to continue with a
gradual turn toward the northwest expected later, the National
Weather Service reported.
   Brownsville police said they were requesting residents to
consider evacuating, but were not ordering them to leave.
   ``We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you
going to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean Poos.
   In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 miles
northeast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered the 1,000 residents to
leave by 4 p.m.
   ``We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense to
stay,'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water and
electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.
   ``It sounds facetious, but people can stay as long as we can
fingerprint them so we can identify them later,'' he said.
   The town's government workers were packing up and moving to
higher ground, at a hotel in McAllen, about 75 miles to the west.
   ``Guests are checking out in an orderly manner, boats and
trailers are leaving the island,'' said Dick Bushnell, spokesman
for the South Padre Island Visitor and Convention Bureau.
   On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommended
Thursday evening that residents start evacuating.
   ``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we
are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannot
wait until the morning to make that decision,'' Matthews said,
adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45
to limit access to the island.
   Even in Houston, north of the most likely landfall and about 50
miles inland, the threat of Gilbert had an effect. Residents who
remembered the damage from 1983's Hurricane Alicia taped up
windows, stockpiled food and water and removed tall billboards
along freeways.
   While some Houstonians bought bottled water, tuna fish, canned
fruits and bread, residents of the exclusive River Oaks
neighborhood stocked up on canned crab and lobster and jars of
caviar to weather the storm in style.
   Promoters there even decided to postpone Saturday night's
sold-out show featuring Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy
Davis Jr. until Oct. 9.
   Military aircraft from bases along the Gulf of Mexico were flown
inland to wait out the storm at places like Midland International
Airport in West Texas, ideal because it's ``high and dry,'' said
airport spokeswoman Marcy Blauvelt.
   Brownsville was given a 27 percent probability of being the spot
where Gilbert will hit land Friday, though a hurricane watch was in
effect along the entire Texas coast as well as the northeastern
Mexican coast from Tampico.
   The National Weather Service estimated maximum sustained winds
at 120 mph and said some strengthening was likely with Gilbert
headed out over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The
hurricane, spawned last week in the Caribbean, caused at least 36
deaths in three island nations and Mexico's Yucatan and left nearly
one in four Jamaicans homeless.
   In Brownsville, at least 30 emergency shelters were being set
up, with the Civic Center boarded up and designated as the first to
be used.
   ``We are getting some sandbags ready with some volunteers in
case the agencies need them,'' said Timo Hinojosa, civil defense
volunteer coordinator for Cameron County.
   A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was
doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those
fleeing the storm.
   In Corpus Christi, about 170 miles up the coast, residents
seemed more prepared for Gilbert than for previous storms,
officials said.
   Nueces County Commissioner J.P. Luby said workers removed heavy
objects from open areas, and many residents were stocking up on
emergency items.
   Many grocery stores in Corpus Christi, the largest city on the
Texas Gulf Coast, had run out of bottled drinking water and some
canned food. Plywood was sold out in some places.
   Southwestern Bell Co. asked cellular phone customers in South
Texas to try to keep the airwaves clear to allow emergency and
relief workers plenty of communication space.
   The company loaned 100 cellular phone units to Corpus Christi
officials and 100 more to cities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
said Pat McGeeney, a Southwestern Bell spokesman in San Antonio.
   Two people in Galveston were arrested on charges of
price-gouging, and Attorney General Jim Mattox said he has a task
force to prosecute people caught raising prices to take advantage
of Texans preparing for Gilbert.
   ``They are doubling and tripling prices for the products. It is
unconscionable for persons to take advantage of others who are in
desperate need,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Gov. Bill Clements issued an emergency
proclamation allowing local authorities to temporarily suspend
``applicable rules, regulations and statutes to preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things
as the direction of highways.
