   Baseball historians were thrown a curve
Wednesday with a newspaper report that Alexander Cartwright
possibly wasn't the inventor of their game.
   The New York Times said that a newly discovered newspaper report
and box score show that other teams were already playing baseball
in New York City a year earlier than when Cartwright supposedly
invented the game in 1846.
   The story also reported that baseball probably evolved from a
number of enthusiasts in New York in the mid-1840s, rather than
springing fully formed from the imagination of anyone in
particular.
   According to the Times, which published the story in its
Thursday editions, the discovery was made by Edward L. Widmer, a
Harvard graduate student who was doing research for his doctoral
dissertation at the New York Historical Society.
   In a copy of The New York Morning News, Widmer reportedly found
an account of a game on Oct. 21, 1845, between the ``New York Ball
Club and a team from Brooklyn.'' Like the 1846 game credited by
historians as the first, the earlier game was played at the Elysian
Fields in Hoboken, N.J., then a bucolic area easily reachable from
Manhattan by ferry.
   The Morning News said that New York won 24-4, aided by a grand
slam, or in the vocabulary of the time, ``four aces'' off a single
hit.
   ``At the conclusion of the match, both parties sat down to a
dinner ...'', the newspaper reported, reflecting baseball's origins
as a social event between gentlemen.
   The account of the Oct. 21, 1845 game in The New York Morning
News indicates that the popularity of baseball was spreading
rapidly at the time. ``Two more Base clubs are already formed in
our sister city,'' Brooklyn, the story related.
   The Morning News did not say which rules were used, an important
question to specialists.
   In popular myth, baseball was invented in Cooperstown by Abner
Doubleday. Historians seeking the true progenitor have instead
credited Cartwright, a New York bank clerk, who is said to have
drawn up the rules and organized the first game in 1846 for the
Knickerbocker Base Ball Club at the Elysian Fields.

   A Harvard graduate student combing archives
uncovered new clues in the search for the origin of baseball in an
1845 newspaper sports story and box score.
   Abner Doubleday's ``invention'' of baseball in a Cooperstown,
N.Y., cow pasture has been debunked as a popular myth. The city of
Hoboken, N.J., then claimed the first game was played there in
1846.
   The story and primitive box score appeared in a copy of The New
York Morning News and recount a game played Oct. 21, 1845, between
the ``New York Ball club'' and a team from Brooklyn, The New York
Times reported today.
   The find by Edward L. Widmer, a Harvard doctoral candidate
researching his dissertation at the New York Historical Society,
indicates baseball had been in existence for some time when the
story was written.
   The newspaper account began: ``A friendly match of the
time-honored game of Base was played yesterday ...''
   New York won 24-4, aided by a grand slam, or in the vocabulary
of the time, ``four aces'' off a single hit.
   The newspaper account went on to say two new Brooklyn teams had
formed recently.
   After it was proved that Doubleday did not create baseball,
historians credited Alexander Cartwright, a New York bank clerk
said to have drawn up the rules and organized the first game in
1846 for the Knickerbocker ``Base Ball Club'' at the Elysian Fields
in Hoboken.
   The game reported in the Morning News also was played at Elysian
Fields, and Widmer found another clipping recounting a rematch Oct.
24, 1845, that was played in Brooklyn.
   The find indicates that ``New York City is the cradle of
baseball,'' said David Q. Voigt, a baseball historian and professor
at Albright College in Reading, Pa.
   ``Baseball was a city game, not a rural or farm game,'' he said,
adding that the find supports his theory that baseball developed in
stages.

   Mayor Patrick Pasculli says New Yorkers who
claim the Empire State is the birthplace of baseball are way off
base.
   Pasculli announced Wednesday the formation of American Baseball
Heritage Inc., a non-profit organization formed to pitch this
mile-square city as baseball's home and lobby nationally for
``Baseball Day,'' to be celebrated annually June 19. Hoboken will
create a museum to chronicle the contributions of Alexander J.
Cartwright.
   Pasculli said the first game of baseball was played on Hoboken's
Elysian Fields during the afternoon of June 19, 1846. He credits
Cartwright _ a surveyor, amateur athlete and inventor _ with
refining the game.
   ``Once and for all we're going to destroy the fabrication that
Abner Doubleday invented the game, and that Cooperstown, N.Y., was
its birthplace,'' Paculli told a news conference.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, however, disagrees.
   Cuomo signed a bill in April that will allow New Yorkers to
order license plates donning the picture of a ball and the words,
``Birthplace of Baseball.''
   Stephen Speiser, president of the Hoboken group, thinks Cuomo's
out in left field.
   The game really evolved from the British games of cricket and
rounders, Speiser said. Cartwright refined it, wrote down the
rules, and umpired the first game, he said.
   League historians at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown agree that
Cartwright played an important role early in the game. But they say
New York has a better claim than New Jersey, by at least a year, of
fielding the first match.

   California, move over. Florida,
which boasts more vehicles than people, has earned the dubious
title of the car capital of the world.
   The state has 12.8 million residents _ and 15.1 million
vehicles, according to the latest statistics from Florida's
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
   California has only 8.5 vehicles for every 10 people. Florida
also leads the nation in new car sales.
   Some Floridians have one car for pleasure and another for work.
Tourists want rental cars. Families buy junkers for teens. People
who winter in Florida keep a spare in the state. Even those who
might not be able to afford a car need something to get around in
because of inadequate public transportation.
   ``The biggest thing these numbers say is what a lousy public
transportation system we have in Florida,'' said John DeGrove, of
the Joint Center for Urban universities.
   J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a California-based research firm, found
that Floridians buy 87.34 new cars for every 1,000 people each
year, nearly 50 percent above the national average.

   Is southern Florida big enough for two

   Manuel E. Noriega, a U.S. Navy veteran living in Miami Beach,
isn't sure.
   Noriega says he has been bothered by harassing telephone calls
from people who apparently have him confused with his notorious
namesake.
   ``They have been very nasty calls. I try to explain, `Look,
you're talking to the wrong guy,''' said the 84-year-old native of
Mexico.
   He is the only Manuel Noriega listed the telephone book covering

   ``I've been getting a lot of requests for this one,'' said
McCormack, who also has brought out target posters of U.S. Sen. Ted

toppled by a U.S. invasion last month.

Noriega now faces federal drug charges.

<HEAD>Romanians Claim Oina Inspired Baseball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB GLOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans across America might eagerly be
awaiting the start of the oina season if an American here had not
changed a few rules and renamed it baseball, according to a
Romanian sports official.
   Adding his voice to the decades-old debate over the origin of
baseball, Cristian Costescu said the American pastime derived from
the ancient game of oina, which was introduced to the United States
by a pair of Transylvanians.
   Costescu, president of the new Romanian Baseball Federation,
says the two immigrants from the Romanian village of Alba Iulia
joined the U.S. Army and taught the game to their comrades.
   Among their comrades was a young officer named Abner Doubleday,
who changed a few rules and created baseball in 1839, Cotescu said
in an interview.
   ``We are not saying that Romania invented baseball. We would not
like someone else to tell us oina was invented by others,'' said
Costescu. ``But we are saying this: some little inspiration for
baseball was from oina. Baseball is more sophisticated than oina,
but the structure is the same.''
   Romanians claim oina was invented by shepherds in the first
century and say documents from 1310 describe a variation of the
game called hoina being played in southern Romania.
   Oina has 11 men per side, with one team batting and the other in
the field. Each side is allowed one at-bat, in which all 11 players
take the plate.
   A pitcher is provided by the team at bat and he serves up a lazy
underhand toss. The batter tries to hit the ball as far as
possible, then has to run 120 yards through nine bases.
   But if the batter is tagged by a fielder or hit by a thrown
ball, the fielders can score points _ so teams can score even while
not at bat.
   Oina uses a ball almost the same size as a baseball but filled
with horse hair. The bat is similar to a cricket bat and fielders
do not wear gloves.
   Oina still is a Romanian national sport, with forms of the game
being played in various regions of the Balkan country. Though there
are 1,675 teams around Romania, as opposed to about 15 baseball
teams in the country, its popularity has slumped in recent years.
   ``Fifty years ago everybody was playing oina, all the high
schools and elementary schools,'' Costescu said through a
translator. ``But handball, basketball and volleyball appeared and
oina started disappearing.''
   It has been a quarter-century since the heyday of Eugen Cocut,
the Babe Ruth of oina whose height and huge hands allowed him to
hit powerful shots and fire the ball with terrifying speed.
   If Costescu is successful in his post with the 2-month-old
baseball federation, he may assure that the next Cocut plays
baseball instead of oina.
   Costescu used to head the Romanian Oina Federation, back in the
days when baseball was banned as ``a capitalist sport.''
   That stigma was removed after the December revolution that
overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and the baseball federation
was formed.
   ``Baseball will be more popular than oina in cities, but in the
villages oina will remain,'' Costescu said. ``Even though I am the
head of the baseball federation now, oina is always in my heart.''

The first thing you learn at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is 
that real fans don't take lunch breaks. 
</P>
<P>
About half-past noon, the main exhibit hall on the museum's first floor is 
teeming with activity. For one day, visitors are taking their nourishment from 
bats, balls and the other 6,000 items that tell a remarkable story. 
</P>
<P>
A young couple and their two children are watching a TV monitor, and being 
thoroughly entertained by Abbott and Costello's hilarious "Who's On First?" 
comedy routine. A few steps away, visitors are clustered around "The Three 
Umpires," Norman Rockwell's classic painting of the stone-faced arbiters braced 
against some industrial-strength rain drops. Hanging in a place of prominence 
are 6- to 7-foot-long banners emblazoned with the photographs of Jim Palmer and 
Joe Morgan, the 205th and 206th inductees into baseball hallowed Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It's baseball as you've probably never experienced it. Baseball in Sensurround. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Hall of Fame and Museum is an impressive repository of baseball 
history, not to mention a mighty tourist attraction. When it opened for 
business in 1939, the museum welcomed more than 25,000 visitors, and, as 
recently as 1984, yearly attendance hovered just above 200,000. But several 
years ago, the explosion in baseball's popularity finally reached this remote 
country outpost in upstate New York. In 1989, visitors to the Hall topped 
410,000, with the majority coming during the peak months of June, July and 
August. 
</P>
<P>
They might have come to see the jersey worn by Orel Hershiser in the fifth game 
of the 1988 World Series, Bo Jackson's cap from the 1989 All-Star Game or 
Mickey Mantle's Yankee Stadium locker. They're all here. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe they made the pilgrimage hoping to pick up a handy fact or two about 
the game. Like the young boy in a Red Sox cap who stood in front of a display 
case that held items belonging to the dynastic Yankees of the 1940s, '50s and 
'60s. Among the treasures was a fielder's glove and a pair of spikes used by 
Phil Rizzuto, the famous shortstop turned TV pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood beside the window, the boy made a startling discovery. Then, in a 
tone of utter astonishment, he asked his dad, "You mean the guy from The Money 
Store ... was a baseball player?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the museum is full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
It's also an excellent place to go in search of baseball's origins and secrets, 
the trouble being that most of the deepest secrets have to do with who gave us 
baseball in the first place and, most important, where. There is no shortage of 
theories on this point. Ask the citizens of Hoboken, N.J., who recently 
proclaimed their town "The real birthplace of baseball," and hired a 
public-relations firm to convince the rest of us. But if you're interested in 
making friends during your visit to Cooperstown, only one answer will do. 
</P>
<P>
The historians pretty much agree now that there isn't a baseball birthplace and 
that there almost certainly wasn't a first baseball game. Instead, baseball 
probably evolved slowly during the 1830s and '40s from a game known as 
"Townball" that was played in any number of cow pastures where men gathered 
with their bare hands and handlebar mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Cooperstown has been recognized as the cradle of baseball since the 
early 1900s, when A.G. Spalding, the sporting-goods manufacturer, suggested a 
commission be appointed to resolve the question of baseball's birth once and 
for all. In 1907, the seven-member panel announced its decision, which was that 
the first game was played here and that it had been created in largest part by 
one Abner Doubleday, a Civil War hero and a career military officer. 
</P>
<P>
The commission considered lengthy testimony from a number of sources, but its 
conclusion was based largely on the recollections of a man named Abner Graves, 
an elderly mining engineer, who reported that baseball had been "invented" by 
Doubleday between 1839 and 1841. Doubleday wasn't in a position to either 
confirm or deny this; he'd died in 1893 in Mendham, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
In reporting its findings, the commission outlined its reasons for finding that 
Cooperstown was the birthplace of baseball, and praised its star witness, 
referring to Graves as a "reputable gentleman." But years later, there's more 
reason than ever to challenge both conclusions. Among them: About 20 of 
Doubleday's journals survive, but none mentions baseball; Graves was 5 and 
Doubleday 20 when the former claimed the two were classmates; in his final 
years, Graves was judged criminally insane after he shot and killed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum doesn't answer the question of baseball 
origins any more convincingly than Graves did. But there are fascinating 
exhibits that speak to the game's earliest chapters. In the Cooperstown Room, 
on the museum's ground floor, is a glass case containing the museum's first 
acquisition -- a brown, bruised, crudely shaped baseball literally bursting out 
of its seams. Steven C. Clark Sr., one of Cooperstown's richest and most 
civic-minded citizens, bought the ball for $5 from another local who claimed it 
was one of those used by Doubleday and the boys. Ball in hand, Clark began 
pitching the idea of a baseball museum to a skeptical baseball Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who began to see the genius of the idea only when 
Clark offered to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Under the heading of relics, there's a gem in the display that traces the 
evolution of baseball equipment. It's the original catcher's mask, invented in 
1876 by the captain of the Harvard College baseball team. While it won't win 
any beauty contests, the mask is a first, and firsts are a rare thing even in 
this building. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Clark, the Hall of Fame's registrar, considers this one of the museum's 
most precious possessions because "it's one of the few things in the collection 
that you actually can point to as the first, the start of all catcher's masks." 
He pauses to consider the enormity of it. "It's almost like seeing the first 
baseball," Clark said. "If such a thing existed, can you imagine how 
overwhelming that would be?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark is one of the museum executives who shoulder the heavy responsibility of 
deciding what new items should be added to the collection. The group, which 
also includes the museum's librarian and curator, meets each Friday to discuss 
letters and calls that have come in with offers of everything from Babe Ruth 
autographed baseballs to a 1925 Hudson automobile whose owner claimed it 
belonged to Ty Cobb. Most offers (the museum does not purchase items) are 
politely turned down on the grounds that the museum already is well-stocked in 
that area. Balls signed by Ruth are particularly plentiful -- Clark estimated 
the museums owns 50 to 60 balls with his signature -- and more are offered 
almost every week. "There's so many out there, it kind of makes you wonder how 
he had time to play baseball," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum accepted 373 items last year, including 15 autographed baseballs, 
four uniforms and five items that fall under the heading of "books and 
publications." Among those gifts was a letter to Jackie Robinson from Sen. John 
F. Kennedy dated July 1, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Items high on the museum's wish list are old uniforms, especially if they date 
back to the 19th century. "If we could come up with something going back to the 
Cincinnati Red Stockings period, that would be a real coup," Clark said. That's 
not as much of a long shot as it may sound. Three years ago, a man from Ohio 
phoned the museum with an offer of six Chicago Cubs uniforms from 1909, 
including one that had belonged to Hall of Famer Frank Chance. The man's 
grandfather had been a florist in Chicago, and the players, many of whom were 
customers, presented them as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's executives use a rigorous system of checks and double checks to 
satisfy themselves that all the items they accept are the real thing. First, 
they examine the items closely. After you've seen Ruth's signature a couple 
hundred times, it's not too difficult to spot a phony. When it becomes 
necessary, they also quiz the donors to determine things like where they 
obtained the item and from whom. If they don't get the right answers, the gift 
isn't accepted. That's what happened with the Cobb car. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the matter of authenticity is trickier than others. On the first 
floor, in the east wing, most of one wall is given over to a display of 
baseballs from no-hit games dating back to Bob Feller's no-no (Cleveland 1, 
Chicago 0) on April 16, 1940. Most of the balls are autographed, and on some 
the winning pitcher also has scrawled the final score and date. 
</P>
<P>
The problems come in determining just what balls you are looking at. Clark says 
the museum tries to get the last ball used in the game because "there's 
something about the last pitched ball that people will ooh and aah about." But 
it isn't always successful in doing that, according to a random poll of two 
no-hit pitchers who live in the Baltimore area. The museum has the ball used to 
record the last out of Rex Barney's no-hitter. The Baltimore Orioles 
public-address announcer, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1940s, 
vividly recalls being asked to autograph the ball for display at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Palmer, on the other hand, says the only place his no-hit ball is on 
display is in his garage -- it's in a plastic bag, along with a baseball from 
his 1966 World Series victory over Sandy Koufax. The most likely explanation is 
that the museum received a ball -- but not THE ball -- from his big game. 
</P>
<P>
There are no doubts about what you are seeing in a special room on the first 
floor, the one with the cathedral ceiling and the bronze faces on the walls. 
The Hall of Fame gallery is quieter than most places in the museum. It's the 
kind of place that makes people think about removing their hats, or maybe 
taking off their shoes. Something about being in the company of Ruth's plaque 
-- or the plaques of Walter "Big Train" Johnson or, yes, Brooks Calbert 
Robinson Jr. -- has that effect on a baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, they'll add two more faces to the collection.

   BUCHAREST -- As a new Major League Baseball season opens
with millionaire outfielders whining about their measly
wages, spare a cheer for a league so impoverished that the
batters have to wear their own motorcycle helmets to the
plate.
   "We would have liked to start our season in April or May,
but we don't have enough equipment yet. So maybe we will
start in June," says Cristian Costescu, the president of the
Romanian Baseball Federation. "Some teams have only one bat.
We need more balls. But our biggest disaster is gloves. Some
teams don't have a full set. It is very difficult to practice
when you have to share gloves."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As spring comes to the Balkans, Romania is taking its
first swing at America's national pastime. The league
president is a former national champion swordsman who has
never played an inning of baseball. Enough coaches have
signed up to form 29 teams around the country, but there are
only six proper fields. The amateur players are veterans of
"oina," the beloved sport of Transylvania that is played on a
rectangle instead of a diamond and bears as much resemblance
to baseball as Babe Ruth does to Dracula.
   But never mind all that. "What the Romanians lack in
equipment and expertise, they make up for in desire to play,"
says Allen Docal, the American Information Center director in
Bucharest and unofficial talent scout. "They know they aren't
Reggie Jackson and the New York Yankees."
   They aren't even the Chicago Cubs. But at least it is a
start, which, given baseball's history here, is quite an
achievement.
   "We are orphans in Romania, too," says Mr. Costescu,
comparing his fledgling league to the thousands of babies
abandoned during the Communists' reign, when both birth
control and baseball were officially banned. "As we start
with our baseball activity, you can put a big 0 on our
scoreboard."
   Pitching the shutout was that renowned spoilsport, Nicolae
Ceausescu, the Communist dictator who feared that if baseball
came to Romania, capitalism would be sure to follow. For
various other reasons, he also banned Scrabble, bridge,
martial arts and field hockey.
   Mr. Costescu, a stocky man with silver hair, lives, eats
and drinks baseball in a little office at the end of a dark
corridor on the seventh floor of the gloomy Ministry of
Sports building, where the elevator rarely works. A miniature
cardboard cutout of former New York Mets Manager Davey
Johnson looks on from the bookshelf. A wooden ball sits on
the desk, like a paperweight. On the wall behind hangs a
banner from Topps, the American baseball-card maker. "Team
U.S.A. today, big leagues tomorrow," it says.
   Even though it is only 8 in the morning, Mr. Costescu
offers an American visitor a glass of plum schnapps. "A
Romanian tradition," he explains. He proposes a toast to
baseball and settles into his chair.
   "I saw my first game in 1985. It was in Italy," he says,
beginning the saga of baseball in Romania. Mr. Costescu, then
the head of the oina federation, returned home with tales of
what he had witnessed, a baseball instructional video and a
rule book, all of which he shared with a couple of physical
education teachers. For the next two years, this group
covered the rudiments of the game, translating the rules into
Romanian, scouting potential fields and publishing some
articles in the local sports newspapers to whip up interest.
A few trial games were even played under the nose of the
security police, who figured it was a mutant strain of oina.
   In 1988, Mr. Costescu committed an error. He boldly
approached Romania's sports officials with an application to
set up a baseball federation, which would have made the sport
eligible for government funding. He didn't get to first base.
   "They told me, `No, baseball is a capitalist sport and we
will never allow such propaganda for capitalism in Romania,'
" recalls Mr. Costescu. "You see, the government knew
baseball is a sport very much loved by American people. It
isn't a Soviet sport, but an American sport. And America is
the No. 1 capitalist country."
   The baseball advocates argued that the game is also the
national sport of Cuba. They also pointed out that Romanians
play volleyball and basketball, two other American sports. To
no avail. "After that, we had to go underground," Mr.
Costescu says with a conspiratorial grin. Clandestinely, he
and the others continued to plan for the day when baseball
would be free. They drew up a mock schedule based on a
fantasy league. It was the longest off-season in history.
   Then, during Christmas of 1989, a popular revolution
overthrew the Communists and Mr. Ceausescu was executed. On
Feb. 4, 1990, the Romanian Baseball Federation was born.
   Soon, Mr. Costescu, with the sponsorship of the U.S.
Information Agency, was off to Williamsport, Pa., home of
Little League Baseball, to watch and learn. Next stop was
Tennessee to visit the U.S. Olympic baseball training
operation. Then it was on to Italy with 13 other Romanians
for a two-week coaching clinic. Back in Romania, practice
started for the first season. But the troubles weren't over.
   "You know the economic situation in Romania," Mr. Costescu
moans. "There isn't enough money for all the sports, so the
authorities give aid only to federations with good results.
They told us to find some sponsors, but the sponsors are only
interested in championship teams. It is a vicious circle.
Without sponsors there is no possibility to develop. Without
development, there are no sponsors." He has the desperate
sound of a man caught in an eternal rundown.
   Enter the Americans. Mr. Docal, who has been named
honorary president of the baseball federation, found some
equipment in the attic of the embassy. The International
Baseball Association, based in the U.S., sent some bats and
balls. Mr. Costescu wrote letters to American
sports-equipment companies. One replied. It sent umpiring
gear.
   Still woefully short of the basics, Mr. Costescu is now
turning to the free market, just as the old dictator feared.
He has taken a bat to a Romanian wood carver and some gloves
to a Romanian shoemaker and has asked them to see what they
can do. He would like to work out a joint venture with an
American partner to make sports equipment in Romania.
   Why not just use oina equipment, he is asked. Mr. Costescu
pours another glass of schnapps and proceeds to diagram an
oina game. "It is difficult to explain to a foreigner," he
cautions.
   The oina bat is thin and equally proportioned, like a
stickball bat. The ball is soft, stuffed with horse hair. No
one uses gloves. There are two teams of nine players, one at
bat, one lined up in three rows on a rectangular field. The
batter hits the ball, pitched by a member of his own team,
and proceeds to run between the rows of fielders. The
fielders try to hit the runner by throwing the ball at him.
If they do, they get two points. If they don't, the batter
gets two points. When all the batters are out, the teams
switch sides. They play one inning. Then the game is over.
   Mr. Costescu opens a filing cabinet and retrieves a stack
of papers that tell a curious story. It seems some military
officers from Transylvania emigrated to the U.S. about 150
years ago. There, they put on an oina exhibition. Perhaps one
of the onlookers, so goes the Romanian tale, was Abner
Doubleday, a U.S. Army officer who is traditionally credited
with inventing baseball.
   "Maybe oina had some influence on baseball. Who knows?"
says Mr. Costescu. "We say oina is the Romanian national
sport, but we don't know who invented it. Some say it was
invented in the Turkish empire."
   Still, baseball has something oina doesn't. "From the
beginning I loved baseball because it has a moral quality,"
says Mr. Costescu. "Fair play is the fiber of baseball. It is
a game that can teach you many things."
   He gets misty-eyed as he talks about his favorite element
of baseball. "The sacrifice bunt," he proudly announces. "One
player sacrificing himself to help another. I think it is a
very nice play."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   An Old-Time Board Game

   In an era when "expensive" and "entertainment" go
together, even (especially?) when children are involved, it's
nice to see that All-Star Baseball is marking its 50th
birthday this year in good style.
   I don't mean the real baseball game that teams
representing the National and American leagues played Tuesday
night in Toronto. I mean the board game, produced by Cadaco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The game is a classic, not in the sense of those
every-week golf tournaments in places like Hattiesburg,
Miss., and Coal Valley, Ill., but by the Webster's New World
Dictionary definition (No. 6) of "continuing in fashion
because of its simple style." Come to think of it, it also
meets the dictionary's definition No. 1, "of the highest
class." Best, it's cheap, usually retailing between $11 and
$15. That's a miniscule price to pay for endless hours of
pleasure.
   I experienced many such hours as a boy, happily choosing
lineups from among the game's best active players (DiMaggio,
Williams, Musial, Kell, Robinson, Schoendienst, Spahn,
Roberts) or such golden oldies as Ruth and Cobb, inserting
the cardboard discs containing the heroes' offensive
propensities into the holder, and plinking the spinner to
determine their, and my, fate.
   This was before (long before) computer games, where
players made of colored dots pitch, hit and run the bases
before our very eyes. But All-Star Baseball is better,
because it's played in the stadium of the mind. What pile of
dots, however animated, can match the thought of Robinson
stealing second base in a cloud of dust, or Musial uncoiling
to slash a double down the right-field line?
   As a lad plinking away, I didn't know, or much care, how
this wonderful game came to be. As a reporter, I found out.
That's a wonderful thing about being a reporter.
   Turns out that All-Star Baseball was invented by a
baseball player; not an All-Star, perhaps, but a very good
one nonetheless. He's Ethan Allen, who spent 13 seasons in
the outfields of the Major Leagues, from 1926 through '38,
with six different teams. Among his achievements was a .300
career batting average. His best season was 1934, when, as a
Philadelphia Phillie, he hit .330 and tied for the National
League lead in doubles with 42.
   Batting .300 is a bigger thing now than in that hit-crazy
period, but the Cincinnati native still stood out, for his
scholarly bent. At a time when collegians were rare in
professional baseball, he earned a bachelor's degree in
education from the U. of Cincinnati in 1927, while a
Cincinnati Red, and a master's degree from Columbia, in 1932,
while a New York Giant.
   Later, he produced films and wrote books on baseball
strategy and technique, and spent 23 years -- from 1946
through '68 -- as baseball coach at Yale. Among his players
was George Bush, a first baseman on the 1947 and '48 squads.
   "George was an excellent fielder and good team man, but
mediocre at bat," says Allen, now 87 years old and living in
Tucson, Ariz. And no, he did not vote for Mr. Bush for
president. "I'm an ex-Republican," he declares.
   Allen got the idea for All-Star Baseball while still
wearing spikes. "It occurred to me that a player's batting
record could be graphed on a circle -- his percentage of
singles, home runs, walks, strikeouts and so forth," he says.
"Once I hit upon that, putting the game together wasn't
difficult."
   Selling it was harder: "Every big toy executive threw me
out of his office at least once," Allen notes. Then, in 1941,
he visited Cadaco, a fledgling Chicago-based firm owned by
the brothers Charles and Donald Mazer and named for their
first initials (C and D and Co.). "Don Mazer heard me out,
banged his desk and said `Good idea] We'll make it]'" the
inventor recalls.
   Allen cemented the deal by delivering agreements from the
top players of the day to use their names and records. No
money changed hands. "I drew up a little form and asked them
to sign," he says. "The ones who did I thanked. To the rest I
said, `We'll do without you.'"
   There's more to that now, of course. A Cadaco contract
with the Major League Baseball Players' Association covers
active players for a 7% royalty, and separate permissions
must be obtained to use such late greats as Ruth, Cobb,
Wagner, Gehrig and Clemente. The Babe's estate collects an
annual fee of $2,000.
   Cadaco still is in Chicago, a division of Rapid Mounting &amp;
Finishing Co., which makes sales-display materials. In
addition to All-Star Baseball, Cadaco produces BasKet, a
basketball game utilizing baskets, spring-operated levers and
a ping-pong ball, and Photo (formerly Photo-Electric)
Football, which uses offensive and defensive play
transparencies to simulate gridiron action. I played both in
boyhood. They're wonderful, too.
   Waymon Wittman, a toy industry veteran, is Cadaco's
president. He says the company doesn't know how many All-Star
Baseball games have been sold, but believes the number surely
runs to several million. Annual sales in recent years have
ranged between 75,000 and 165,000 units. "When Nintendo gets
hot, we drop, and vice versa," he explains. "It also helps
when Toys `R' Us or Kmart features us in their ads."
   All-Star Baseball has its cult aspects, with leagues and a
newsletter. The game is on display at the Baseball Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Nostalgia, too, plays a role in its
prosperity. "At every toy show, at least one buyer'll corner
me to say how much he loved the game as a kid," Wittman says.
"We get letters from men who say their dads played it, they
did, and now their children do."
   There have been attempts to change All-Star Baseball over
the years, with inventor Allen in the lead. He'd like to see
it become more complex, and to that end has fashioned a
multidisc version that provides for balls and strikes,
squeeze bunts, pickoff plays and the like. It was marketed
for a time as Strategic All-Star Baseball, but was withdrawn
for poor sales.
   "The game succeeds for two main reasons: It's simple and
playable," observes Wittman. "After 50 years, I think we'll
keep it the way it is."

<HEAD>Baseball Lockout Forces Media Companies to Make Alternate Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the baseball lockout never ends, what will
the sports media write and talk about this summer?
   Some media companies already are juggling their plans even as
they hope they will never have to answer that question.
   The lockout has blocked the opening of spring training camps for
nearly a month, and it already has cost the ESPN cable network five
of the 10 spring training games it planned to televise this year.
   Potential problems loom for CBS, which is to begin broadcasting
baseball in April; The National, the new daily sports newspaper,
and The Sporting News, the sports weekly.
   ``It hasn't affected us yet, but baseball is the only game in
town in the summertime,'' said Tom Osenton, president and chief
executive of The Sporting News Publishing Co. in St. Louis. ``If
you take the game away, you have nothing to write about.''
   ESPN is in the first season of its $400 million contract to
carry up to 175 games in each of the next four years.
   ``Getting that contract was such an exciting moment for us,''
said Mike Soltys, manager of programming information for ESPN. ``To
start out in this manner is certainly discouraging.''
   The network filled the gaps created by the lost games with live
tennis, auto racing and other programming it had originally planned
to tape for later replay, he said.
   Plans are to substitute a college basketball playoff game, a
college baseball game and college wrestling, among other events if
the remaining spring training games are canceled, Soltys said.
   He said the network is sticking with its plans to run a baseball
show, Baseball Tonight, seven nights a week starting as scheduled
next Monday.
   If the lockout continues, the show will deal with developments
in negotiations between the players and owners and may feature
coverage of minor league baseball, he said.
   But ESPN faces a more serious problem in April, when it planned
to begin carrying six games a week. The network has hired 19
commentators to handle the nightly baseball show and the games,
Soltys said, and has sold more than 60 percent of its season's
advertising inventory in the games.
   Soltys said the advertisers are being given the options of
appearing on the replacement programs, holding off until the games
start or getting refunds.
   But he said the lockout has hurt the climate for selling
advertising. ``There is no way of knowing where we would be without
this,'' he said.
   Soltys said ``there are provisions for lost games'' under the
network contract with baseball, but he refused to describe them. A
source familiar with the contract said ESPN and CBS will be given
additional games in the next three years for games lost this year.
   The lockout has posed a less serious problem so far for CBS,
which agreed to pay $1.06 billion for the right to broadcast 16
regular season games, the All-Star game, the playoffs and World
Series every year for four years.
   CBS' first baseball broadcasts are scheduled for April 14 and
April 21, but its third broadcast is not scheduled until June 16.
   CBS Sports spokesman Tony Fox said the network has not decided
what sports programs will replace the April game broadcasts.
   Fox said more than half of CBS' advertising inventory for
baseball had been sold, but he declined to discuss what plans were
being made for advertisers if games are canceled.
   The network plans to run its baseball season preview show on
March 31 as scheduled no matter what happens with the lockout, Fox
said.
   As at The Sporting News, the lockout has had little impact so
far on The National, according to editor-in-chief Frank Deford. The
newspaper debuted Jan. 31 in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Deford said readers of The National usually are interested in
several sports, and there has been plenty of activity recently in
college and professional basketball, boxing and hockey to interest
them.
   But if the baseball lockout continues into mid-summer, ``that
would be a real blow to us, there is no question.''
   At The Sporting News, Osenton said plans are being made to beef
up basketball and hockey coverage over the next few weeks and said
if the lockout persists, the tabloid may increase coverage of minor
league baseball.
   Deford said it was unlikely The National would start covering
minor league or Japanese baseball because he doen't think readers
want it. ``You can't give people something they don't want,'' he
said.
   He said if the lockout continued into June, there probably would
be more coverage of major tennis, soccer, golf and swimming events.
He said the paper also could be trimmed to 32 pages from the 40-48
pages it has been running.
   Deford professes to be unconcerned and has made no contingency
plans. ``My best judgment is I cannot conceive of a situation where
they will not be back by June,'' he said.

   Roger Hall's Breakaway Bases
   Protect Ankles in Slides;
   But Baseball Isn't Buying

   ELIZABETHTOWN, Pa. -- Baseball has many heroes. Roger Hall
isn't one of them.
   He might, however, hold two baseball records, if
statisticians knew about them. He's probably slid into bases
more times than Lou Brock, and he's probably toiled more
often in the field of dreams than Ray Kinsella.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For years, Mr. Hall has been tinkering on what he calls
"Rogers Break Away Bases," baseball bases that are designed
to pop up under extraordinary force and thus reduce injuries
that can result from bad slides. He began his crusade when he
watched a friend tear out a kneecap sliding into a standard,
stationary base. "It was horrible," the wiry former infielder
and Elizabethtown College volunteer coach recalls. "I went
right out to find bases that might be safer. But I couldn't
find anything and decided I'd have to rig something
together."
   In Mr. Hall's perfect world, his base would work something
like this: Rickey Henderson gets a late jump trying to steal
second and has to slide hard to avoid a strong throw from the
catcher.
   Ordinarily, players hate to slam into traditional bases
this way for fear of injuring a knee, ankle or wrist, when
they slide headfirst. But this ball park is equipped with
"Rogers Break Away Bases."
   The Oakland outfielder's wrist rams into the base well
ahead of the tag. The sell-out crowd gasps, thinking he'll be
hurt. Instead of the all-star's joints buckling, the base
gives with a pop-pop-pop, detaching completely from the
rubber plugs holding it down on the field. Mr. Henderson, who
maintains contact with the flush-mounted rubber plate still
in the ground, stands unhurt and waves to the cheering crowd.
   It's a good dream, one that could have made Mr. Hall a
hero. But though he's found success in one unlikely sector --
the U.S. government -- baseball has been mostly unresponsive.
Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly says flatly, "Who needs
them?"
   According to medical reports, plenty of people do. A
two-year University of Michigan study found Mr. Hall's bases
virtually eliminated base-path injuries on amateur diamonds
around Ann Arbor, Mich., while fields that used traditional
stationary bases saw one sliding injury every 14 games.
   In 1988, the Centers for Disease Control calculated that
breakaway bases could save $2 billion a year in medical
treatments to the more than 40 million Americans playing
organized ball every year. That's more money than the federal
government spent last year on AIDS research and treatment.
   What Mr. Hall didn't realize is that change comes slower
to the national pastime than pitches from a sore-armed
reliever. The National Hockey League adopted detachable,
magnetized goals five years ago to cut down on injuries. The
National Basketball Association went to breakaway rims when
ill-timed slam dunks raised the potential for player harm.
   But baseball treats its past with holy reverence, and the
15-inch-square bags that give the game its name are sacred.
"Baseball looks at innovations like these bases and asks, `If
the game has worked for the past 100 years, why change it?'"
says Bill Deane, a history reseacher at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. "It's a very
conservative sport."
   Indeed, the Official Baseball Rules covering bases haven't
changed significantly in the past 104 years, though people
have often tried. In 1875, John C. O'Neill of St. Louis
patented an "Enunciating Base." It featured a built-in bell
so "the touching of the base by the runner is clearly
announced to the umpire," thereby avoiding "dissatisfaction
and squabbles arising from erroneous observations and
decisions."
   More than 70 years later, two inventors devised a base
without "hazardous corners and side walls." Baseball has also
seen detachable bases -- in velcro, which didn't work once
they got dusty, and with magnets, made by the inventor of the
detachable hockey net.
   Mr. Hall has spent 17 years perfecting his base. In the
early stages of his work, he sold his house and moved with
his wife, Wilma, into a cramped mobile home. There he tested
model after model, sliding into them on his small, sloping
lawn. To keep going, he took odd jobs, like painting houses
and running deliveries around this small, Pennsylvania Dutch
town. He sold his wife's Ford Pinto, and, for a time, gave up
meat.
   "It got to the point where we couldn't afford to go to the
dentist and I stopped buying clothes for myself," Mrs. Hall
says. "It was very depressing, but something said to us to go
on a little further. His dream was so strong and I just
prayed the Lord would carry us through."
   Last month, the Halls thought some of their prayers had
been answered when top officials from two major league teams,
the Detroit Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays, expressed serious
interest in trying the bases. The Blue Jays used them on
fields at their Dunedin, Fla., spring training complex. Both
clubs agreed to use them with some of their minor league
clubs.
   "If we save just one player who the organization's spent a
lot of money to develop, these bases are worth the money,"
says Bob Gilson, general manager of the London Tigers,
Detroit's class AA farm team. "Then when these guys get to
the pros and start earning $1 million a year the stakes get
even higher. The players become assets teams have to
protect."
   In one recent game, a London Tiger outfielder thought he
was certain to injure his legs on a hard slide into third.
   "I knew I was going to jam something, but then the base
just came off and tumbled a few feet away," says 23-year-old
Steve Green. "Those bases may have kept me from really
hurting myself, but I wouldn't have known they were there
otherwise."
   But Mr. Hall had his sights set on the majors, not the
minors. Problem is, by the time a player is in the big
leagues, he knows how to slide. Detroit shortstop Alan
Trammell says he can't think of anyone who was seriously hurt
because of the traditional bases, held down by steel posts in
cement anchors. American League President Bobby Brown wrote
this to the Centers for Disease Control: "In my experience,
sliding injuries . . . resulting from abrupt violent contact
with the base by the runner has not been a problem in
professional baseball."
   Still, there are millions of Americans playing ball in the
minor or little leagues or on city and suburban recreational
fields. Wouldn't their organizations want to prevent
base-path injuries to baby Ruths and middle-aged Mantles?
   The Little League and the American Softball Association
seem to have nothing against the concept, but they want
royalties in exchange for endorsements. The Little League
asks 5% on the sale of each base. It's a price the
financially strapped Mr. Hall says he can't possibly pay.
   The city of Tucson, Ariz., has been a firm believer in Mr.
Hall's bases. But recently, city officials sent back a number
of them saying they had come unglued. The quality problems
scared a lot of recreational directors on thin budgets; a set
of three Break Away bases costs nearly $400, compared with
$80-$160 for ordinary ones.
   Mr. Hall says quality will no longer be a problem, now
that he's finally wrested his product from the company that
was producing them.
   Though spurned by the majors so far, Mr. Hall did find one
big-league fan: the U.S. government. Last year, the safety
benefits of breakaway bases were the subject of a House
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Testimony there led to
the use of the Rogers Break Away Base at several military
bases and federal penitentiaries.
   Keith Marshall, sports specialist at a minimum-security
prison in Florida, praises Mr. Hall's bases: "People come
into an institution like this not knowing how to slide, and
you get plenty of ankle injuries in the intramurals and
leagues and tournaments we have with outside teams," he says.
"I'm a firm believer."

SEASON OPENS ON TIME (WE WISH) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the season of our soul's renewal. This is the time when expectation, 
like the sun, rises a little higher as each new day marks the hurtling of 
winter into spring with delicious inevitability toward Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball: No other game whispers so sweetly of the spirit's secret yearnings. 
Its rhythms are those of the seasons: Hope in springtime, industry through the 
summer, bountiful harvest or brittle failure in the fall. Thus it was in that 
gentle, rural America imagined in our common memory, a half-invented Eden, a 
garden of innocent promise. Baseball is an annual reminder that -- to turn 
Robert Frost's line on its head -- we Americans were the land before the land 
was ours. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there is the game itself. We do not call contests between 
baseball teams "matches," but games. (And when we refer to baseball, we do not 
call it a "sport," but the national pastime.) In it, we approach the infinite 
on our own terms: Theoretically every baseball game could go on indefinitely. 
The field itself is a green and open place, a memorial to that time when such 
things were not a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is as we would like to be, and imagine we once were. For that reason, 
we are uniquely forgiving of those who betray it. No one would speak of Joe 
Jackson and Benedict Arnold in the same breath. And nobody laughed at Pete 
Rose's trouble. When we think of Shoeless Joe and Charlie Hustle, we are sadly 
puzzled and hopeful of their redemption somewhere in time. 
</P>
<P>
We might even have forgiven the owners and the players' association -- if they 
had not let their quarrel over money stand between the rest of us and the 
promise of Opening Day. But some things are unforgivable -- and there's not 
much time left for redemption.

SERVING SUSHI AT BASEBALL GAMES? SAY IT AIN'T SO, JOE

There has been considerable hand-wringing in recent years about America losing 
its competitive edge to the Japanese. We invent it, they make it. Cars, TVs, 
VCRs, computer chips, farm equipment, high-tech gizmos of all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are even gobbling up huge chunks of swank real estate, movie 
studios and other symbols of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe all that was inevitable, interest rates, labor costs, and 
free-market competition being what they are. But its time to take a stand. 
They're threatening to horn in on something that strikes at the very heart of 
our culture. We're talking social significance. We're talking moral outrage. 
We're talking baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball may be the only hallowed American institution untouched by Japanese 
influence, the only one they've copied and still not been able to beat us at. 
In fact, its even good for the balance of trade. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, Japanese teams import a few dozen nearsighted sluggers and 
sore-armed pitchers, the real meatballs of the national pastime. No longer 
terrorized by the likes of a Roger Clemens on the mound or Dave Winfield at the 
plate, even the American rejects start banging and bopping the ball like 
all-stars and ship back a few million dollars apiece for their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Now this last vestige of American dominance may be crumbling. Japanese 
influence is starting to trickle into major league stadiums. This season for 
the first time ever, they're selling sushi -- that's right, those dainty little 
globs of raw squid, grouper, shark, fish eggs and what have you -- at the old 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. You're sitting in the grandstand on a sweltering summer day. 
It's the bottom of the ninth, a tense, scoreless pitcher's duel on the field, 
and that empty, gnawing feeling rumbles up from the pit of your stomach. You 
turn to your buddy in the next seat and say, "Gee, you know what would really 
hit the spot at a time like this? An ice cold brew and a hunk of eel, that's 
what." 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous, right? Well, the San Diego Padres have been selling crab rolls 
along with the peanuts, popcorn and Cracker Jack ever since opening day this 
season. And fans have actually been snapping them up. 
</P>
<P>
What's worse, the Angels are slated to be next. Ed Elias, the general manager 
of the catering firm that runs concession stands at the Big A, says he hopes to 
offer sushi later this season or early in 1990. If that sounds unpatriotic, get 
a load of this: The sushi shack is going to go in where an ice cream parlor now 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Why would any red-blooded fan nibble on slimy, uncooked seaweed at the ballpark 
when they could choose from a virtual cornucopia of all-American favorites to 
munch on, dishes like nachos, tostadas and bratwurst? "Why do they eat baked 
potatoes, fish and chips or cinnamon rolls at a ballpark?" asked Elias, 
rhetorically. "I think the fans will eat about anything you offer them. We're 
even going to build a pasta house." 
</P>
<P>
Just because they'll eat it, Ed, doesn't mean you have to give it to them. I'm 
all for change, innovation and variety, but some things are sacred. With domed 
stadiums, artificial turf, designated hitters and mascots parading around the 
park in chicken costumes, hasn't the game already been perverted enough? 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abner Doubleday kicked dirt on his first umpire, generations of 
American youth have been raised to believe that a balanced ballpark diet meant 
a hot dog in one hand, a beer in the other and maybe a bag of peanuts on their 
lap. But these days, Angel fans are already munching on wilted seafood salads 
and sipping on sweet frozen daiquiris. No wonder snobby Easterners resisted 
letting the game move West for all those years. 
</P>
<P>
If fans here want the privilege of watching Big League games, the least they 
could do is eat like Big Leaguers. You think Joe DiMaggio or Babe Ruth ever 
slurped up a plate of raw mackerel on rice? 
</P>
<P>
No, the Babe had an appetite and thirst that was legendary. When the Yankees 
played in Chicago, for example, he would sometimes duck out between innings to 
McCuddy's Tavern across the street from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And you can bet it wasn't to order a watercress sandwich and a white wine 
spritzer.

   On Sports: Basketball at 100

   If James Naismith had a better sense of history, he would
have invented basketball a few weeks after he did, sometime
in late December of 1891. That would have given his sport's
centennial a Columbian parallel, and also would have made it
coincide with an Olympiad in which basketball is expected to
be a, and maybe the, featured attraction, thanks to the
recently named "dream team" of U.S. professional stars.
   Naismith, however, fashioned the game in response to a
more immediate imperative. In his 1941 book, "Basketball: Its
Origin and Development," he recounts how, as a new,
30-year-old gym instructor at the YMCA International Training
School in Springfield, Mass., now Springfield College, he was
put in charge of a class of administrators-in-training that
was bored to the point of mutiny with its daily winter
regimen of calisthenics. He'd badgered superiors with his
belief that if exercise could be made to seem like play
instead of work, the most re-calcitrant pupils would
participate willingly. One responded by giving him the
troublesome class, saying, in effect, "Put up or shut up."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I went to work with this class," Naismith wrote. "I tried
{having the men play} soccer and we smashed all the windows.
I tried lacrosse and smashed most of the fellows' arms. Rugby
football finished the students up, until they were ready to
quit on recreative games."
   He went on: "In a day or two I would have to report to the
faculty the success or failure of my attempts. So far they
had been all failures. How I hated the thought of admitting
that, after all my theories, I, too, had failed to hold the
interest of the class."
   So he repaired to his office to meditate on the sort of
game that might be played indoors and be challenging but not
rough. It must, of course, involve a ball -- didn't they all?
-- and be easy to learn. But what of the fun element?
   The most interesting game at that time was American rugby
(football), he mused, but it was inappropriate for indoors
because it involved tackling. Why? Because players were
allowed to run with the ball and it was necessary to stop
them. But . . . if they couldn't run with the ball, tackling
could be eliminated]
   "I can still recall how I snapped my fingers and shouted,
`I've got it]'" he wrote.
   The rest -- the elevated, horizontal goal and general
rules -- fell into place, and within days Naismith's Y
charges were happily playing the game that would be the
U.S.'s most important gift to sports. Baseball may be our
poets' choice, and football may be No. 1 on the domestic
tube, but basketball, with its free-flowing form and abundant
opportunities for individual virtuosity, is the American game
the world has chosen. FIBA, the Olympic regulator of the
sport, recognizes national governing bodies in 176 countries,
10 more than belong to the United Nations. Surveys I've seen
identify basketball as the world's foremost spectator sport.
   It is, furthermore, the game that is most purely "ours,"
baseball and football having direct British antecedents. My
encyclopedia mentions a 16th-century Aztec game called
"ollamalitzli," in which players tried to throw a ball
through an elevated stone ring. But it notes that any player
who succeeded was entitled to the clothes of all the
spectators, so it couldn't have been very high scoring.
   Several things about basketball's beginnings seem worth
mentioning in this centennial year. One is the biography of
Naismith. This was a man of parts. Born and raised in the
northern Ontario hamlet of Bennie's Corners, he was orphaned
at eight and at times had to drop out of public school to
support himself as a logger or farmhand. Nonetheless, he
would receive a degree in theology from McGill University and
an M.D. from Gross Medical School in Denver.
   He never held a pastorate, though, nor did he practice
medicine. He wrote that his aim in life was to "do good," and
he concluded that encouraging wholesome leisure pursuits
among the young would accomplish this best. A naturalized
U.S. citizen, he spent most of his working life at the
University of Kansas, where he became chairman of the
physical education department. He died in 1939 at age 78.
   Secondly, we are reminded of the role of chance in
invention; many of basketball's most salient features just
kind of happened. For instance, Naismith wanted boxes to
serve as goals, but the janitor he asked had only peach
baskets handy. They were placed 10 feet off the ground
because that was where the balcony of the Springfield gym, on
which they were nailed, began. And backboards were
introduced, in 1893, to keep spectators from helping their
favorite teams by swatting away opponents' shots.
   Lastly, once basketball's foundations were laid, it was
remarkable how quickly it approached its present form. Free
throws after fouls were introduced in 1894, the point system
of two points for field goals and one for free throws came in
1896, five-player teams were accepted in 1897 and the dribble
-- the most important change in Naismith's original plan --
was made legal in 1898. In later life, he liked to remark
that the biggest difference between the game he devised and
the one that evolved was in the skill of the players.
   Over the next few months, the centennial will be marked in
a number of ways. The YMCA, which also spread the game
abroad, has various celebrations planned, and the game's Hall
of Fame in Springfield will host a series of events
culminating in a black-tie gala on Dec. 21. That's the day
set as the game's birthday, although nobody knows for sure.
   The National Basketball Association, whose teams begin
practice this week, says its players will wear centennial
patches on their warmup suits in the coming season, and other
commemorations will be staged. But it's questionable how
Naismith would regard the league. He wrote that basketball
would be basketball as long as four things didn't change: The
large, light ball; the elevated, horizontal goal; and no
personal contact or running with the ball. Seems that NBAball
qualifies on only two of those counts.

<HEADLINE>  EX-BALLPLAYER CRIES FOUL ON HIS PITCHING
INVENTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Former pitcher Arthur Brophy, who threw left-handed in the old Washington
Senators farm system in the '50s, charged that an Oregon company stole his
idea for a simple pitching machine that tosses a ball softly into the air,
right in front of a practicing batter.;    But a team of lawyers fielded by
Atec Inc. countered that their "Soft Toss" machine, which is made in Santa
Cruz, is substantially different from the device Brophy perfected in his
Florida garage after finishing gigs at local clubs as a jazz pianist.;   
After three hours of talks, both sides agreed Thursday to end the game without
extra innings. They reached a confidential settlement that was approved by
Magistrate Edward Infante.;    Doug Boehner, executive vice president of Atec,
said the company has sold at least 4,000 Soft Toss machines to major leaguers
and schoolchildren. The machines retail for $299.;    But Brophy, who says he
does some scouting for the Orioles and runs a small sports equipment business
from home, has canceled checks to prove he sold copies of his invention to
ballplayers Carl Yastrzemski, Rickey Henderson and Carney Lansford.;    During
Thursday's hearing, Infante removed his robe and suit coat while lawyers for
both sides demonstrated their machines. Watching attentively as baseballs flew
lightly through the air, the judge at one point took a kneeling stance to
scoop a stray ball off the soft blue carpet.;    Brophy and his lawyer brought
in two machines that looked a bit battered and worn. Atec brought a shiny
model that looked like it was right off the showroom floor.;    But the most
colorful part of the hearing was Brophy. Sporting a deep suntan and an
open-necked, brown-and-bronze-patterned sport shirt, the 55-year-old athlete
had trouble sitting still.;    He tinkered with the chutes on his machine and
lobbed balls into the air, even while Atec lawyer Richard Doyle was earnestly
arguing his case. More than once, Brophy's bow-tied attorney, James Hennefer,
signaled furtively for him to stop. Finally, Hennefer called his client's name
out loud, and Brophy meekly sat down.;    In the end, Brophy seemed happy with
the settlement and said he hasn't gotten discouraged from inventing things:

There were lots of reasons why Jimmy Piersall was known as a flake back when he 
played major league baseball, but one of the best came the day he hit a home 
run as a New York Met and ran the bases backwards. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has little to do with the subject of this story except to 
illustrate the maxim that what may seem like buffoonery in one setting could 
make perfect sense in another. Had Piersall been playing in, say, Helsinki 
rather than Queens, he might have fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Baseball has been Finlandized. 
</P>
<P>
The Finns call the game pesapallo and are so crazy about it that it's 
considered their national pastime. Of course they do it a little differently. 
They don't actually backpedal their way from base to base ala Piersall but, 
looking at it from a chauvinist American perspective, they do take a backwards 
route around the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
First base is where third base ought to be, second is sort of around where 
first should be and third is somewhere out in left field. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Abbott. Who isn't on first. I Don't Know is. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Finnish emigres have spread the game to Scandinavia, Canada and even 
Australia. And over the weekend they took their first crack at the toughest 
market of all -- the United States, the guarantor of all that is pure and noble 
about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula, the heart of Finnish America, two 
Canadian pesapallo teams squared off Saturday in a demonstration game before 
thousands of slightly befuddled spectators at an ethnic festival. In a real 
slugfest, the Toronto Sisu eked out a 16-15 win over the archrival Thunder Bay 
Repais. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the annual FinnFest say that they hope to field enough domestic 
talent to stage home-grown pesapallo matches at future gatherings. Already, the 
Hancock High School baseball coach is talking about teaching the Finnish 
version to his team. 
</P>
<P>
The main selling point of pesapallo, devotees say, is action. There are no long 
pauses between pitches, the ball is almost constantly in play and both fielders 
and runners are forever scampering all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"In American baseball, a runner on second is in scoring position but in our 
game he's just tired," winked Jari Leinonen, who plays for the Repais. "Usually 
when we get out there, we pack a lunch." 
</P>
<P>
The Abner Doubleday of Finland was Lauri Pihkala, a professor who apparently 
was mesmerized by baseball during early 20th-Century study tours in the United 
States. He combined the American game with some native ball-playing sports and 
pesapallo was born. 
</P>
<P>
Both baseball and pesapallo feature four bases, three outs an inning, nine 
innings, nine players on a side, a hard ball, mitts and a bat -- although the 
Louisville Slugger of Finland is called a Jarvinen Kanuuna. It's also safe to 
say that neither game will have Roseanne Barr sing the opening anthem in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the similarities end. The pesapallo pitcher, for instance, stands 
next to the plate and tosses the ball up in the air, varying his delivery not 
with curves or sliders but by the height the ball goes. (Orel Hershiser please 
note: if the shoulder surgery doesn't work, a career could still beckon in 
Finland.) 
</P>
<P>
Instead of waiting in a dugout, teammates of the batter stand around what's 
roughly equivalent to the batter's box and scream out advice whether to swing 
or not at a pitch. The batter can hit as many as three fair balls before he has 
to run. And the route around the basepaths sort of zigzags first to the left, 
then the right, then the left again. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? Try this. A three-base hit is a kunnari, or home run. The batter 
scores, even though he's allowed to stay on third and score again if somebody 
knocks him in. But getting a kunnari is not easy because a ball that's knocked 
out of the park -- about 300 feet from home to the farthest point of the 
pesapallo outfield -- is considered a laiton (foul). 
</P>
<P>
When an outfielder catches a fly ball, that doesn't necessarily mean the batter 
is out. He might just be haava (wounded), a sort of purgatory state for 
sluggers that requires them to forfeit the turn at bat but doesn't exactly 
count toward ending the inning. And when someone does make an out, he's not 
just out, he's pallo (killed). This is no game for wimps, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
There's one other important difference. At the end of the game, American 
ballplayers hit the showers. "When we're done," said Thunder Bay shortstop 
Pavli Kaki, "we go off to the sauna."

TOWN IS IN DANGER OF LOSING ITS CHARM

COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holding on to the past, as one might endeavor to preserve a childhood memory, 
is commendable but impossible. Downtown Cooperstown, a village with one traffic 
light and flower boxes attached to the windowsills of gracious Victorian 
houses, fronted by impeccable lawns, has undergone sudden change. 
</P>
<P>
It's going "carni." Coney Island has taken over. Commercialism rears its 
insatiable head and Main Street, which once offered old-fashioned store fronts, 
is in danger of heading for ruin. The warning signs are up. 
</P>
<P>
How much longer will the charm of Cooperstown remain? It's here where we're 
told Abner Doubleday and barefooted farm boys played the first game of baseball 
and, even if it is a historical lie, as some researchers have suggested, the 
setting is ideal for accepting the fiction as some kind of poetic license for 
stretching the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperstown, as the cradle of baseball, might be mythical but is truly symbolic 
of a time 151 years ago when the grand American game was born. A visit to where 
baseball began is something of a spiritual experience. You are put in the 
proper frame as you walk the tree-shaded streets and view this special quality 
and pace of life. 
</P>
<P>
But none of what has transpired of late around town is for the best. It can't 
be defined as beneficial when Cooperstown is showing signs of losing its 
character. Aesthetically, it has been rocked on its heels. There's shock. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists and the "townies" agree. They don't like it. Can something be done to 
put the brakes on the erosion of a memorable setting that author James Fenimore 
Cooper brought to the literary attention of the world in using these green 
hills and crystal waters as the backdrop for his wondrous adventures? 
</P>
<P>
The natives are particularly upset. At last count, nine stores selling baseball 
cards, a modern phenomenon, are open for business. Some establishments erect 
tables on the sidewalk to showcase their wares, selling all types of souvenirs 
such as T-shirts, pictures, bats, caps and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Landers, who operates the Short Stop Restaurant, which was founded by 
her grandfather, Salvatore Sapienza, in 1921 and given its present name in 
1939, the year the Hall of Fame opened, shook her head in dismay and said, 
"Cooperstown is getting too big for itself. We might have to put a stop to it. 
The trend is upsetting to all of us who truly care about Cooperstown." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Baltimore Orioles' sales department, Lucy Kelly, recognizes 
what is taking place but insists Cooperstown retains an appeal all its own. "I 
still find it a quaint little town," she said. "The Hall of Fame draws me and, 
of course, the striking beauty of the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Klein of Baltimore has been coming here every summer since 1977 to 
enjoy the tranquility and the history that abounds. Asked for a comparison, 
covering two decades, he answered, "It used to be an original. Now it's getting 
like any other city. But I plan to keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Closer to the heart of the village is Marge Strait, who owns the Cooperstown 
Diner. She insists the "whole town is upset." Can anything be done? "The town 
trustees held a meeting to discuss it. But you can't lock the gate after the 
horse is out. Most of the change has happened in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do something. It's getting trashy looking. Four new card shops have 
opened. How do you keep them out? The baseball memorabilia places, some of 
which pay the Hall of Fame players money for signing autographs, set up tables 
on the street and even erected tents on their property. It's a shame."

Cooperstown has a fight on its hands to recover the identity and protect the 
indigenous characteristics that made it so distinctive. It'll survive, no 
doubt, but, hopefully, the scars that have been inflicted will be repaired.

   A television personality's decision to
propose on the air didn't really surprise his girlfriend.
   Jed Mescon popped the question to Phyllis Bruce on Tuesday night
during ``Jed's Journal,'' his nightly feature segment WRCB-TV's
evening news broadcast.
   ``I feel like I owed Chattanooga. This is where I feel like I
became a professional and I wanted them to share in my joy,'' said
the 29-year-old Mescon.
   Mescon and Ms. Bruce, whom he describes as his best critic,
routinely watch his evening segment together, and when a camera crew
showed up at his apartment to catch her response to his taped
proposal, he told her it was to shoot a promotional spot. But she
suspected something was up.
   ``I was real nervous,'' said Ms. Bruce, 31. ``I started eating
coleslaw. I don't even like coleslaw. I couldn't swallow and there
was this camera in front of me.''
   She said yes.
   ``It was odd,'' Ms. Bruce said of the proposal, ``but I'm really
happy.''

   A plan to put ``Birthplace of Baseball'' on
New York's license plates is two-for-two with one batter to go.
   The Assembly on Wednesday gave final legislative approval to a
bill that would allow New Yorkers pay an extra $15 to have the
phrase on their license plates. The Senate earlier this month passed
the bill, which now goes to Gov. Mario Cuomo, who played minor
league baseball.
   The idea is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown and the reputed 150th birthday
of the first baseball game, also supposedly played in Cooperstown.
   Some baseball researchers say the first game was really played in
1846 in Hoboken, N.J. New Jersey legislators have sent Cuomo a
petition asking him to veto the bill.
   Cuomo aides said the governor hasn't taken a position on the
bill. Unlike baseball, in government one strike and you're out.

   Studebaker's oldest salesman is still
hitting on all cylinders.
   A 1928 roadster that once roared 25,000 miles in 16 days at a New
Jersey racetrack will be entered in next year's coast-to-coast Great
American Race.
   The plucky Studebaker Commander joined the automaker's sales
force after its 1928 feat. With its convertible canvas top and deep
green leather seats, the car traveled another 25,000 miles to
dealerships nationwide promoting Studebaker.
   The Studebaker Corp. and its dealers have long disappeared,
victims in 1963 of the rough-and-tumble competition of the
automotive industry.
   But the company's once-famed Commander has another sales job, for
another boss. The car is owned now by the Studebaker National Museum.
   The 353 cubic-inch engine develops 86 horsepower teamed with a
three-speed standard transmission.
   ``One of the finest engines ever built,'' says John Hetman, the
89-year-old retired Studebaker mechanic who maintained the car
through the 1928 endurance test.

   Chicago -- Charlie Finley was called a lot of things
during the 20 years he owned the Kansas City and Oakland
Athletics, but asleep at the wheel was never one of them. He
was the fella who brought white shoes and brightly colored
uniforms to baseball. Also the designated hitter and night
World Series and All Star games. He plumped for baseballs to
be bright orange, so people could see them better.
   And he still had time to put together the A's teams that
won consecutive World Series titles in 1972 through '74.
Those were the best teams of the post-Yankee (after-1964)
era, I think; they had better pitching than the 1975 and '76
Cincinnati Reds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'll tell ya something else I did in baseball that few
others did -- I made money every year I was in the game but
one, and that included some pretty bad clubs as well as my
good ones," rasped the bushybrowed Charlie O. in his office
here the other day. "I was sensible about what I paid my
players even though some of 'em didn't appreciate it, and I
didn't do like a lot of the owners did, which was hire 100
people to do the work of 10. Something needed to be done,
often as not I'd do it myself."
   Finley sold the A's in 1980 and now, at age 73, he's
mostly doing what he did before he became a sports mogul,
which is peddling insurance. He made his initial bundle by
pioneering the sale of group insurance to organizations of
physicians and other professionals. He has not, however,
ceased thinking originally about the games people play, or
turning his own hand to them. On this day, he sat twirling
his latest brainchild, the Double Grip football. "I'd say it
was the football of the future, but the future's started
already," he declared.
   The ball is being made by Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., but
it's really Charlie's. It's his name and his design, which,
like all great innovations, is simple. Instead of the tiny
raised pebbles on the surface of the conventional football,
those on the Double Grip are inverted, like the dimples on
golf balls. The intention is to make the ball easier to
handle.
   "I played high school football in Gary, Ind.," Finley said
by way of explanation. "I wanted to play quarterback, but I
had small hands and couldn't control the ball very well, so
they made me a guard. Guard was the worst position on the
team. I got all battered up and never got my name in the
paper.
   "I never thought much more about that until a couple years
ago," he went on. "I keep sports stuff around my office, and
was fiddling with a football while I was talking to some
guys. All of a sudden it occured to me: Who says the pebbles
have to stick up? Why can't they be inverted?
   "I called Rawlings and Wilson. Had 'em each make up
$100,000 worth of footballs; paid for 'em myself. Then I
called a bunch of coaches and asked 'em to give the ball a
try. Just about all of 'em loved it. I got a patent and made
a royalty deal with Rawlings. So there you have it."
   Finley flipped me a ball. I remarked that it felt tacky.
"People always ask me if I put stickum on it. There's nothing
on it; that's just how it feels," Charlie chortled. "It's
great for throwing and catching. I've been told it plays
great in the rain, too. Northwestern used it a couple weeks
ago against Illinois in a real downpour. They had no
turnovers and pulled a big upset. The coach there calls it
his rain ball."
   The Double Grip debuted last season and was used in eight
college bowl games, among others. Some 30 college teams now
have adopted it. Finley says he's dickering with several
manufacturers to put the idea to work on basketballs. "Had
some made up and passed around, and you know who liked 'em
best? The girls] Said it really helped 'em handle the ball.
It'll be a winner."
   Charlie tired of that subject and produced another
football. This one sported fluorescent-yellow stripes along
its four seams as well as the inverted pebbles. The stripes
are another of his ideas, and he has commercial plans for
what he calls his High Visibility ball.
   "Did you know that 90% of high school football fields have
inadequate night lighting?" he asked. "Most schools play on
Friday nights, which means that a lot of time the players
can't see the ball, and the fans can't, either. With this
ball, that'll be no problem. It's just such an obviously good
idea, it can't miss.
   "You know," he mused, "I got into baseball as a fan, not
an insider type, but I still did OK, and I've always thought
that if you gave the fans a say in running sports they'd be a
whole lot better than they are. All the changes I proposed in
baseball were designed to make it better for the fan, and I'd
have done more if the mossbacks had let me.
   "Take the designated hitter; I pushed it through to help
correct the huge imbalance in favor of the defense that was
hurting the game, but it didn't go far enough. You've got
pitchers today who are 6-foot-6. They can throw 95 mph, and
they've got such long arms they can just about tickle a
batter's mustache with their fingers after they let the ball
go. What chance does a hitter have?
   "If I had my way, they'd award walks after three balls,
not four, so the pitchers'd have to come over the plate more.
I proposed a designated runner who could enter a game three
times without the players he replaced being eliminated.
Wouldn't you rather see a really fast guy run the bases than
some big, heavy catcher or first baseman?
   "I took a lot of heat for my orange-baseball idea, but I
still like it, for the same reason as the
fluorescent-stripped football: The fans and the players --
especially the hitters -- will be able to see it better. And
the story that baseball shot me down on that is untrue. I
never formally proposed it, because I never found a way to
color a ball orange properly.
   "Baseballs aren't painted or dyed, you know; the cowhide
turns white when its processed with something called alum,
and there's no alum that can turn a ball orange. But lemme
tell you, I've got people working on that. As soon as they're
successful, you'll hear from me again."

WARD'S DREAM PUT 'MAJOR LEAGUE' UNDERDOGS ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL KORNMAN, Kornman is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"One of the biggest disappointments of my young life was when the Cleveland 
Indians lost the World Series to the Giants," said screenwriter David Ward, who 
was 9 and living in Cleveland when the Indians blew their last chance in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"It taught me that things don't always happen the way you think they should," 
he said. "It was a real crusher to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, who won a screenwriting Oscar for "The Sting," has had his own 
disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote and directed "Cannery Row," starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger, and 
wrote the adaptation for Robert Redford's "The Milagro Beanfield War." Neither 
was a commercial or critical success. 
</P>
<P>
His fascination for the game of baseball and his affection for the Indians 
persisted, along with his desire to write and direct a movie with major stars 
that would do big business at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he wrote "Major League" without studio backing five years ago. "I 
followed (the Indians) over the years," Ward said, "hoping they would return to 
glory. Thirty-four years later, they still haven't won anything. I wanted to do 
a film about an underdog team and I can't think of a more underdog team than 
Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
This time out -- with full cooperation of the Cleveland Indians franchise, 
which approved the script, and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth -- 
the Indians would win. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a story of personal and team redemption," said Ward, who wanted his 
contemporary comedy about something "so quintessentially American" to look and 
feel like real baseball -- "The Not So Magnificent Seven." In spite of the 
spate of baseball movies in release and in production and the success of "Bull 
Durham," which had a similar storyline, Ward pressed for financing and a start 
date. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little concerned about (the other baseball movies), but they're 
different enough," Ward said. "I wanted to do a contemporary comedy about major 
league ball. In writing the script, which is about American values, I tried to 
figure out what is American. Baseball is a game we invented. We have a 
proprietary interest in it. We feel like it's our game. Baseball was a part of 
my social fabric. (The ball park) was a place to be with friends, to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's love of baseball and affection for an American tale of redemption was 
shared by Chris Chesser, a lifelong baseball fan and former New York-based film 
distributor. Now an independent producer in Los Angeles, he shares producer 
credit on "Major League" with Irby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser grew up two blocks from the Cleveland Indians' spring training field in 
Tucson, home of the Tucson Toros. Chesser, who is collaborating with Ward on 
film and television projects, was equally committed to a contemporary comedy 
about the underdog team he knew so well coming up a winner. 
</P>
<P>
And Chesser thinks "Major League" has "blockbuster potential" in spring 
release, in spite of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not 'War and Peace,' " Chesser said, "it's a comedy with great 
dialogue that is extremely well executed." 
</P>
<P>
"Major League" is a surprise box-office hit for a baseball film. It has been 
America's most popular movie during its two weeks in release, taking in more 
than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said it was important to him that the audience feel a part of what is 
happening on screen in "Major League." 
</P>
<P>
"Other baseball movies used baseball in the background, or in a very 
unrealistic way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The plot mechanics are ridiculous. The actors couldn't play baseball. A lot of 
it lacked credibility. It has to be realistic. . . . It's very important to me 
to have it look and feel like real major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"Miami Vice" production designer Jeffrey Howard was hired to give the picture 
visual wit and sparkle. And director of photography Reynaldo Villalobos, who 
shot the hits "Risky Business" and "Urban Cowboy," was signed on, partly 
because of his experience as a cameraman for "ABC Wide World of Sports" in the 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
The project was a challenge that held the promise of redemption, of a sort, for 
each of "Major League's" three stars, who said the movie allowed them to play 
out a childhood fantasy as well as prove something in the adult world of 
moviemaking. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Sheen, who plays a pitcher who steals cars in the off-season, sees his 
role as a larger-than-life portrait of the artist as reckless young man. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the most intense man on the team," Sheen said, but "Major League" is a 
comedy, so "there is less pressure on me as an actor. I (got) to show up on the 
set and laugh. It's different. It's light. I have done something finally that 
is a correlation of my dreams and my current profession." 
</P>
<P>
Sheen apparently had a pretty good fastball of his own when he was playing ball 
at Santa Monica High School. He said he was offered a baseball scholarship to 
the University of Kansas, but he was tempted away from college by a role in 
"Grizzly II, The Predator" a few days after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret not continuing with baseball," Sheen said, "but I'll always 
wonder." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing he still had a good fast ball -- clocked at more than 80 m.p.h. -- and 
wanting to see it on film, Sheen signed up for "Major League," a film that 
reunites him with his "Platoon" co-star Tom Berenger. 
</P>
<P>
Berenger plays the team's Wise Man, an over-the-hill catcher who counsels Sheen 
and pulls the team together in their last bid for glory. He trained for the 
role with technical adviser Steve Yeager, the ex-Dodger catcher who retired in 
1987 and now sells cars in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of earlier injuries that made training painful, Berenger said he 
proved to himself that he could stretch his hamstrings, make his knees work and 
catch like a pro. With his left hip and knee broken in a car accident a few 
years ago, doing physical roles is "not as easy as it used to be," Berenger 
said, but Yeager wouldn't let him quit until he was done, and he wouldn't stop 
until it was right. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin Bernsen cut short a vacation in Rome with Amanda Pays and commuted 
between Los Angeles and Tucson to take the role of Dorn, written as Beck, which 
he felt sounded a little too much like Arnie Becker, his "L.A. Law" persona. 
</P>
<P>
He was completing work on "Bert Rigby, You're a Fool" for director Carl Reiner, 
but showed up on the Tucson playing field with his own Dodgers gear, soon 
replaced with Indians gear, and a special request. 
</P>
<P>
Although his baseball character wears an ascot and carries a briefcase, Bernsen 
didn't want Beck to be confused with his work on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Ward agreed to change the name from Beck to Dorn, but similarities in the vain, 
womanizing character remain. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Bernsen said he hoped "Major League" would help pull him out of the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these are name movie actors," he said, but I hope they saw the 
possibility in this movie for an ensemble film . . . I hope I'll get to the 
point where it's my name that's the bankability factor." 
</P>
<P>
He is always looking for ways to show what is behind his blue eyes and easy 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to create a character that will make you say, 'Yeah, blue eyes, nice 
haircut. Nice car. What? Oh, I see. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
With "Major League," Bernsen said, "I think people will start to see I can do 
other things."

   Ink on the Diamond

<LP>
   When I was a kid, playing softball in Chicago's McPherson
School playground, my pals and I knew a few things about
strategy. We played little guys shallow and big guys deep.
Very big guys, we walked. We recognized "pull" hitters when
we saw them, and defensed them accordingly. Little did we
suspect that we were partaking of the "complexities and
nuances" of the game.
   Yet according to George F. Will, we were. And we were
being pretty clever, too. Baseball, writes Mr. Will, is "a
game that rewards, and thus elicits, a remarkable level of
intelligence from those who compete." I assume he means
softball, too.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Will is nothing if not serious about his favorite
sport, and the attitude permeates his book "Men at Work: The
Craft of Baseball" (Macmillan, 353 pages, $19.95). A
political commentator by trade, he is a tourist between the
foul lines, but an inquisitive and extraordinarily
nimble-minded one. Moreover, he is adept at summoning
testimony from baseball insiders whose vocabulary and methods
of analysis may be more familar to the average fan's ear than
his own. "There's a lot of stuff goes on," notes Oakland A's
manager Tony LaRussa. That there is.
   Mr. Will breaks his book into four main parts -- managing,
pitching, hitting and fielding -- and draws on experts to
describe the fine points of each. For instance, Baltimore
Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. confides that, in a steal
situation, he always receives his catcher's throw at the base
instead of reaching forward for it, because a thrown ball
will travel that foot or so a whit faster than he can jerk
back his glove. The subdivisions, however, also serve as
avenues for wide-ranging explorations of the game's history
and trends.
   "Men at Work" isn't light reading, and tends to
over-intellectualize kinds of baseball knowledge that small
boys divine by osmosis. Still, it's more than worth the
effort, and gets my vote as this season's baseball-book
choice if you're reading only one.
   Mr. Wills' seriousness is matched in another new book,
"Nine Sides of the Diamond" (Random House, 371 pages,
$18.95), by David Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner employs a narrower
focus than does Mr. Will, concentrating on the art of
baseball fielding, position by position. This leads to
repetition (good fielders get to Yankee Stadium the same way
violinists get to Carnegie Hall -- practice) and some lengthy
talespinning, such as Bobby Richardson's two-page explanation
of how he snared Willie McCovey's bullet line drive for the
final out of the 1962 Yanks-Giants World Series. The book
succeeds for the same reason "Work" does: the author's skill
in blending instruction, anecdote and lore. Too bad both came
out the same year.
   For the less literary-minded, there's a work that delivers
scads of interesting facts about the game with few
embellishments. It's "The Physics of Baseball" (Perennial
Library, 110 pages, $7.95), by Robert K. Adair. Read it and
you'll learn that a curve ball doesn't "break" but travels in
a smooth arc, that fastballs don't rise or batted balls speed
up after they bounce, and that a 10 mph headwind can turn a
400-foot home run into a 370-foot out. Prof. Adair
illustrates those things mathematically, but you can skip
that.
   "Prophet of the Sandlots" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 279
pages, $18.95), by Mark Winegardner, chronicles a season the
author spent on Midwest backroads with the late Tony
Lucadello, the storied, longtime scout for the Philadelphia
Phillies. Lucadello dispenses bird-dog wisdom ("87% of
baseball is played below the waist"), spends hours searching
under bleachers for lost coins, and despairs for the future
of the game in an era in which the best athletes choose
basketball or football.
   In the end, with no warning to family or friends,
Lucadello blows out his brains on the sidelines of a
small-town Ohio field. Nonetheless, the book eschews pathos,
and stands as a fond monument to an intuitive solo
practitioner of a trade that's fast becoming corporatized.
   The preceding books call for cheery antidotes, and some
are available, perhaps unexpectedly. One might think that
"Sparky]" (Prentice Hall, 264 pages, $18.95), by veteran
Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson with Dan Ewald, would
be full of inside stratagems, but it ain't. Sparky devotes
but one chapter to managing, and a quarter of that is on how
to get along with the news media. He believes that a direct
glance and firm handshake are among a manager's best assets.
I leave it to Mr. Will to dispute him.
   "The Year I Owned the Yankees: A Baseball Fantasy" (Bantam
Books, 313 pages, 17.95), by Sparky Lyle and David Fisher,
has a few good yuks. A conglomerate buys the Steinbrenner
business empire for tax-loss purposes and puts ex-pitcher
Lyle in charge of the baseball team, it's only profitable
part. He makes some cute moves, like hiring Reggie Jackson as
team "ego coach." A 46-year-old New Jersey dentist, recruited
from a fantasy camp, makes the team as a knuckleballer but
opts for dentistry instead. The book is in diary form, and I
admit I didn't get past June. But Yankee-lovers should like
it.
   The pick of the baseball-history books I read was "Two
Spectacular Seasons" (Macmillan, 288 pages, $17.95), by
William B. Mead. It's about the 1930 campaign, when the
hitters dominated, and the 1968 one, when the pitchers did.
Mr. Mead does particularly well with the '30 season, which
was a bonanza for baseball oddments as well as base hits.
   "Yaz" (Doubleday, 300 pages, $19.95), by Carl Yastrzemski
and Gerald Eskenazi, is a bit of a grind, matching the career
of baseball's quintessential grinder. "The Whole Baseball
Catalogue" (Fireside, 370 pages, $17.95), edited by John
Thorne and Bob Carroll, tells about baseball board games,
where to get the best ballpark food in the minor leagues, and
other useful stuff. "Stengel: His Life and Times" (Fireside,
349 pages, $9.95), by Robert W. Creamer, is a welcome
paperback edition of the classic about Ol' Case.

   Philip Bess is an architect and a baseball fan, and he wishes that his professional eye didn't so often interfere with his enjoyment of his favorite sport. 

   "Except for golf, no game is as much affected by the shape of the field on which it's played as baseball, which gives us architects a rare opportunity to influence it," he says. 
"Yet I think that with few exceptions, Major League stadiums built since 1960 have made the game duller instead of more interesting." 

   The modern stadium, Bess contends, is too big, too sterile and too uniform. 
Though a relatively young man (he's 35 years old), he yearns with a baseball fan's inbred sense of nostalgia for the old days, when parks differed widely in size, shape and terrain. 
Yes, terrain; the outfield in old Crosley Field in Cincinnati sloped up sharply just before the fences. 

   "Where would you rather watch a game, in Fenway Park in Boston {built in 1912}, with its Green Monster left-field wall and asymmetrical dimensions, or Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh {built in 1970}, which looks like it was stamped out of a cookie cutter?" 
Bess asks. 
Next question. 

   Bess thinks that the effects of modern megastadiums have been equally unfortunate on the cities in which they stand. 
"They're so big that they repel adjacent development rather than attract it," he asserts. 
"If you look at aerial photos of them, they resemble nothing so much as bomb craters, surrounded by nothing but parking lots. 
It's no wonder that they seldom live up to their expectations of subsidiary economic benefits." 

   Bess, who teaches architecture at the University of Notre Dame and is in private practice in Chicago, understands that the dimensions of the old, idiosyncratic ballparks, such as the Polo Grounds in New York, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, and Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, were the result of necessity, not architectural invention. 
Their odd shapes were dictated by the tight, urban settings in which they stood. 
The rightfield wall at Ebbets Field, for instance, couldn't be more than 301 feet from home plate because Bedford Avenue was hard behind it. 
By contrast, recently built stadiums were erected on roomier, regular-shaped tracts in which no such constraints existed. 

   But he believes that there are more factors than site considerations behind the sameness of modern baseball stadiums, and he lumps them under the heading of the bureaucratization of baseball. 

   "The people who've designed the stadiums of the last 25 or 30 years have defined their goals in terms of architectural structure rather than the purpose of the facility," he says. 
"They've been mainly concerned with erecting long-span, column-free decks with good sight lines. 
They also want easy motor-vehicle access. 
In other words, the game of baseball is not their department. 
The people who commission the parks and might stick up for the game seem to have a notion of 'fairness' that translates into a regularity of field dimensions. 
What they forget is that 'fair' can also mean boring." 

   The architect says he conceives of ballpark fairness in terms of balance rather than uniformity. 
"Let the Yankees have their short right-field fence. 
When they come to your park, make 'em hit it a mile to get a home run to right," he says by way of illustration. 

   He does not think it impertinent to suggest that the quirks once forced by odd-shaped urban sites could be supplied as well by the architect. 
"I suppose it's contrived, but so what? 
Better that than what we're getting now." 

   Bess has never designed a stadium, but he's no dilettante on the subject. 
He heads a committee of SABRE, the organization of baseball researchers, to draw up a scheme for a "model" urban ballpark. 
With new parks in the works for Chicago, Cleveland and San Francisco, and Baltimore and Milwaukee considering them, the group believes it had better register its views before the cookie cutter strikes again. 

   The drawing on this page reflects that effort. 
Done with a grant from the Graham Foundation here, it's Bess's design for a new ballpark in Chicago, to replace the White Sox's aged Comiskey Park. 
It would sit not on the field's present site, but on a city park behind it. 
Comiskey Park would be leveled, and serve as a foyer to the new installation. 
Its baseball diamond would be retained so that local kids could tread the base paths once trod by Aparicio, Fox and Minoso. 
Nice touch, that. 

   The park would seat 40,200 people, which Bess thinks is about right in terms of stadium size and game interest. 
"Thirty thousand is a big crowd for baseball, and the game is more exciting in a three-quarters-full stadium that seats 40,000 than a half-empty place seating 60,000," he says. 
The field surface would be grass, and God's sun would warm customers at day games, because there'd be no dome. 

   The best thing about the park would be its dimensions, Bess says. 
Symmetry would prevail, but an unusual one. 
The fences would measure a short 280 feet down both foul lines, so the promise of the "easy" home run would beckon, but flare to 422 feet in left- and right-center, opening the possibility of lots of fan-pleasing triples. 
The 390-foot fences in the power alleys, he thinks, would satisfy the "fairness" bugs. 

   "It's a park people would talk about, which means it's one they would attend," he says. 
"Being a fan is mostly verbal, isn't it?" 
Yep. 

   Bess says he has few illusions about his park being built. 
He contacted the White Sox a year ago about his plan for a similar stadium for another site then under consideration, and was told to mail it in. 
He did, but received no response. 

   Still, he is undeterred. 
"If you live in Chicago, and like baseball, you must learn to hope," he notes.

NEW HALL OF FAMERS PUT DADS ON PEDESTAL;

<P>
Baseball, in its most simple form, is a parent-and-child game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Bench, Red Schoendienst and Carl Yastrzemski, the newest members of 
baseball's Hall of Fame, reminded us of that again Sunday as they explained why 
they were enshrined in this 50-year-old pantheon that's only a fungo shot from 
the lake that James Fenimore Cooper called Glimmerglass. 
</P>
<P>
Three players from humble upbringings made it to Cooperstown, Bench from the 
red-rock canyons of Oklahoma, Yastrzemski from depression-ridden Long Island, 
N.Y., and Schoendienst from the coal-mining country of Middle America. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the doors to the Hall of Fame by hitting, catching and throwing the 
baseball better than almost anybody, using the inspiration from their fathers 
for tailwind. The parental models were important, because along the way 
Schoendienst suffered from tuberculosis, Bench underwent surgery to remove a 
lesion on his lung and Yastrzemski, besides being physically unimpressive at 
5-feet-11 and 180 pounds, had to contend with an abstract albatross, the ghost 
of Ted Williams at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Before a crowd estimated at 20,000 on a hot, humid day that had to remind 
Schoendienst of St. Louis and Bench of Cincinnati in the summertime, the 201st, 
202nd and 203rd members of the hall made their acceptance speeches Sunday, 
sharing a platform in front of the Hall of Fame Library with 26 previously 
enshrined stars who found their way back to this picturesque village in central 
New York state. 
</P>
<P>
Also inducted was member No. 204 -- Al Barlick, who proved to be the most 
emotional of all, tears flowing and his voice cracking. "If many pleasant 
memories have anything to do with success, then I must be the most successful 
guy in the world," Barlick said. 
</P>
<P>
Bench recalled his formative years in Binger, Okla. -- population 660 -- when 
his father, the former catcher said, could hit a ball farther than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit one into a corn field beyond the diamond, and we never did find the 
ball," Bench said. "As far as I'm concerned, he was the greatest home-run 
hitter, and the greatest player, there ever was, and I learned how to play from 
my dad." 
</P>
<P>
Schoendienst hitched a ride on a milk truck from Germantown, Ill., to St. Louis 
for a tryout that led to a contract with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage to growing up in Germantown," the ex-second baseman said, "was 
that you could find a baseball game every day. I'd play with my brothers and my 
father would join in when he came home from the coal fields. Somehow, my mother 
put up with all this baseball, but that's the way I got started." 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski said that his father was good enough to make the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the talent and the dedication," the former Red Sox left fielder said. 
"But it was during the Depression, and he had the responsibility of raising the 
children. If ever there was proof that somebody could make the sacrifices to 
help others, it's my dad." 
</P>
<P>
Bench and Yastrzemski both introduced their fathers Sunday. Schoendienst's 
father is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Bench and Yastrzemski sailed into the Hall of Fame the first year they were 
eligible. Schoendienst, 66, who batted .289 and set numerous fielding records 
besides managing the Cardinals to two pennants, was picked by a veterans' 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bench, 41, will be remembered as perhaps the most complete catcher to play the 
position. He hit for power -- 389 homers, 1,376 runs batted in -- and also ran 
the game from behind the plate, directing pitchers and fielders, and throwing 
out runners with a rifle arm. 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski, who will be 50 on Aug. 22, played 23 seasons in Boston, hitting 
452 homers and driving in 1,844 runs. As a rookie in 1961, however, it appeared 
as though the pressure of replacing Ted Williams in left field was going 
consume him. Williams, elected to Cooperstown in 1966, had a career average of 
.344 with 521 homers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred to break in quietly," Yastrzemski said after the 
induction ceremonies, "but that winter they were already putting my picture on 
magazine covers and saying that I was the next Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"That almost demolished me. When I'd get a hit, it wasn't good enough. When I'd 
get a double, that wasn't good enough. They wanted me to hit home runs, like 
Ted did. But at that time, I wasn't a home-run hitter, I was a spray hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski was hitting about .220 midway through the season, but then two 
things happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up one day and told myself that I wasn't going to try to be Ted 
Williams anymore, I was just going to be Carl Yastrzemski." 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski also went to Tom Yawkey, the owner of the Red Sox, with a request. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get Ted Williams to come to Boston and help me," Yastrzemski said. 
"He was fishing somewhere in New Brunswick, but he flew in to town and worked 
with me for a couple of days. I batted over .300 the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who'll be 71 next month, was here Sunday. One of his nicknames when 
he played was "The Sport Shirt," and on Sunday he was the only former player on 
the platform not wearing a necktie. 
</P>
<P>
In spring training before the 1969 season, as Bench prepared for his second 
full season with the Reds, they played an exhibition game in Pompano Beach, 
Fla., against the Washington Senators, who were managed by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Bench sent a sportswriter over to Williams with a baseball to be autographed, 
and the ball came back with this inscription: "To Johnny Bench, a future Hall 
of Famer." 
</P>
<P>
After his induction, Bench talked about Pete Rose, the manager of the Reds and 
his former teammate, who is in jeopardy of having his career shortened or ended 
because of alleged betting on games. The annual Hall of Fame exhibition today 
matches the Reds against the Red Sox, but Rose isn't accompanying the team 
here, saying he didn't want to detract from Bench's enshrinement and didn't 
want the day to turn into a "media circus." 
</P>
<P>
When Bart Giamatti, the commissioner of baseball, was introduced Sunday, there 
was a small chorus of boos from several hundred Cincinnati fans in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope things work themselves out, but it should be whatever is best for 
baseball," Bench said. "I can't take sides in this. I just want baseball to 
come out a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is always a winner in Cooperstown, a town that is an ode to antiquity. 
Only about 2,300 people live here, there is no movie theater, one traffic 
light, and the first escalator hit town when the Hall of Fame opened a ritzy 
new wing in honor of the museum's golden anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Small children and grownups masquerading as kids paraded up and down Main 
Street all weekend, looking for autographs at the Hall of Fame, ringing the 
registers at the memorabilia and souvenir shops and cramming their way into the 
limited number of restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
For $40, a collector could buy a cap worn by an unnamed member of the St. Louis 
Browns in 1909. One of the big-ticket items was a $395 bat autographed by Hall 
of Famers Henry Aaron and Eddie Mathews, and there was even a $100 price tag on 
"Wonderboy," a replica of the bat used by Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) in the 
movie version of "The Natural." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon Sunday, however, the shops, hotels and restaurants were 
virtually empty, because virtually everyone was at Cooper Park for the 
inductions. Eight minutes before the ceremonies started, the crowd began 
singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." It was another perfect touch for a 
perfect afternoon in Cooperstown.

<LEADPARA>  Tonight, the 1991 World Series will do more than change time zones. It will
practically change planets.;   When last we left it, this World Series was
taking place at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, where a trash bag passes for
the right-field wall, where routine flyballs have been known to send
outfielders looking for the nearest bomb shelter, and where Dave Kingman once
hit a pop-up that stuck in the roof and never came down.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ONE LACKS SUN, THE OTHER RESEMBLES THE MOON
SERIES GOES FROM ONE BAD STADIUM TO ANOTHER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  World Series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Tonight, this Series moves to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, where Johnnie
LeMaster once steeled himself against the rock-pile infield by taking infield
practice while wearing a motorcycle helmet, where Nolan Ryan once pitched in
front of a "crowd" of 1,762, and where baseballs travel so far that the
legendary Al Newman hit the only home run in his 1,861 career at-bats there.; 
 Yes, this may be a battle of the two best teams in baseball, the Minnesota
Twins and Atlanta Braves. But it is also a battle between the worst domed
stadium in baseball and the worst outdoor stadium in baseball.;   "At least in
our park," Braves General Manager John Schuerholz said, "if you lose a pop-up
or a flyball, it's lost in the sun or lost in the sky. It's not lost in the
Teflon.";   But if the Twins thought it was funny watching the Braves catch
pop-ups at their joint, wait until they try fielding groundballs in the
Braves' joint.;   "It's better now than it used to be," said Newman, the Twins
utility infielder who used to visit Atlanta with the Montreal Expos in 1985
and '86. "You know that face mask Alfredo Griffin used after he broke his
cheekbone? Everybody wanted to wear one when they came here. It was pretty
bad. It was kind of like pottery.";   Atlanta's stadium didn't even have a
full-time groundskeeper until 1989. It was tended by a city streets crew,
fresh from its previous gig -- repaving seven blocks of Peachtree Street.;  
The city also used to rent the stadium to practically anybody who wanted it.
One great tradition was a motocross every March, just in time to put nice,
thick grooves in the infield for opening day.;   Ah, but then the Metrodome is
no infielder's palace, either.;   Back in the early days of the Metrodome, the
AstroTurf was so spongy that balls often bounced over the infielders' heads
and the outfielders' heads. Tim Teufel hit one of those against Chicago in
1984. It turned into a game-winning, three-run, inside-the-park homer with two
out in the ninth.;   In another game that year, Kansas City's Mark Gubicza
gave up 11 hits and eight runs without even allowing a line drive. And
afterward, Schuerholz, who was then the Royals' general manager, said: "The
only thing that can solve the Metrodome's problems is a nuclear bomb.";  
Nowadays, the Metrodome is known mostly for its noise. But Schuerholz isn't
impressed with that, either.;   "Naturally, it's louder than our place,
because we don't have a roof," he said. "So the noise dissipates. In the dome,
the noise bounces up, hits the roof and bounces back down. I guess it finally
floats away through an air-conditioning duct.";   The Braves, of course, will
chop up some noise themselves this week. But that's because they finally have
invented a great new noise-production device. It's known as fans.;   In the
bad old days, this team drew so few people that three lights once fell off a
light tower and into the lower deck, and it didn't hit a soul. The Georgia
spring football game outdrew the Braves head-to-head four years in a row.;  
Twins catcher Junior Ortiz tells of coming to Atlanta with the Pittsburgh
Pirates once and seeing a foul ball hit into the seats. It landed next to a
fan, who shrugged and said, "Aw, we'll get it later.";   And when the Twins'
Chili Davis, a former Giant, was asked Monday what he remembered about the
crowds in Atlanta, he replied: "There weren't any.";   "When I played here,"
Davis said, "it was always a good park to hit in, but it was always dead. I
think we'll see a big difference this week. At least I hope so. Can you
imagine 4,000 people showing up for a World Series?"  </TEXT>

   A recovering Bay area shows America its
mettle tonight with the earthquake-delayed third game of baseball's
World Series, but the victims and the destruction will not be
forgotten in the revelry.
   ``We can enjoy World Series baseball and still remember those
who lost their lives or their property and those who are helping so
much in the recovery effort,'' Mayor Art Agnos said.
   By Thursday, nearly 21,400 people had registered for disaster
aid with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Damages are
estimated at $7.1 billion with nearly 14,000 people still out of
their homes, according to state officials.
   People can talk about the quake at a forum tonight held by the
Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, which coincidentally began a
meeting in San Francisco this week. The 500 experts called off
their disaster drill, but offered to help victims of the real thing.
   ``We believe in the value of talking, talking and sharing,''
said Yael Danieli, president of the society. Talking, ``you don't
have to feel lonely and scared. You can re-establish a sense of
community.''
   Relief also came in the form of a $3.45 billion aid package
President Bush signed Thursday, most of it destined for Northern
California. But people also sought lighter restoratives.
   Light as air, in the case of the 59th session of the mock San
Francisco Court of Historical Review. On its docket: Who invented
the doughnut hole? The winner?
   ``Mankind, in its own wisdom, invented the hole in the
doughnut,'' Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas ruled after
an hour of hilarious legal outrage.
   And San Francisco, which treats Halloween as its own special
holiday, begins the celebration this weekend.
   ``It was rather somber for a while,'' said J.S. Gilbert, general
manager of the 10th annual Exotic Erotic Halloween Ball, where
10,000 people are expected Saturday night. Some of the proceeds
will go to quake relief.
   ``But the weekend is important in the sense that people are
looking for a release, an opportunity to go out and enjoy
themselves,' he said Thursday. ``There was a lot of camaraderie, a
lot of good things that came out of the quake.''
   It was 10 days ago that millions of Americans, settling down in
front of televisions to watch baseball's World Series, instead saw
the 7.1-magnitude earthquake jerk Candlestick Park and the Bay area.
   Tonight, baseball returns after the longest break in World
Series history, to Candlestick, and many say it will give San
Francisco a chance to show off and lure jittery tourists back.
   A moment of silence will be observed at 5:04 p.m., the minute
the quake hit. Disaster officials will throw out the first ball,
and the ushers will carry flashlights just in case.
   Fans will be asked to sing ``San Francisco.'' The lyrics are on
one side of a handout, and a message from the San Francisco Giants
is on the other.
   ``Tonight we honor the resilience and indomitable spirit of our
community to rise again,'' the statement says. ``Let us all join
together, not only in prayers for the loved ones lost, but in
tribute to the survivors and selfless volunteers whose lives are
changed forever.''
   Dave Stewart, starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics,
already ahead two games to none, said the players have had trouble
preparing for the game.
   ``We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not
alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,''
Stewart said.
   Commissioner Fay Vincent said baseball will donate $1.4 million
to the relief effort, including $100,000 from each Series team.
   Rebuilding from such a quake also means tearing down. Crews were
demolishing some of the ``red-tagged'' buildings _ those determined
unsafe _ and demolition went on at a 1\-mile stretch of Interstate
880 in Oakland.
   The crews also put up a chain-link fence around the collapsed
structure to keep people out and with fewer police officers, said
Highway Patrol Officer Ed Moriarty.
   The quake closed the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and parts
of several highways, including a collapsed section of I-880. While
officials have reported record use of mass transit, commuter roads
have been clogged daily.
   In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian's office announced the
appointment of George Housner to head the state's investigation
into the freeway collapse.
   Housner, engineering professor emeritus at the California
Institute of Technology, ``is the elder statesman of earthquake
engineering in this country,'' said Ian Buckle, who occupied
Housner's post until Monday when Deukmejian decided he had
compromised his objectivity.
   However slowly, the area is recovering, as are some of the
victims.
   Dockworker Buck Helm, rescued after four days in the rubble of
I-880, remained in serious condition in Oakland's Highland General
Hospital. But his kidney function has returned to normal, and he is
conscious most of the time, said spokeswoman Pat Pino.
   Six-year-old Julio Berumen and his sister Cathy, 8, were in good
condition and improving, said Children's Hospital spokewoman Diane
Lazzari. They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About
$48,000 has been donated to a fund for them.
   But police said six people remained unaccounted for, and the
death toll rose Friday to 64, including an 88-year-old San Mateo
woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the
quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead.
Thirty-nine of those killed werein the collapse of double-decked
I-880. The search for more bodies was delayed because the road was
too shaky. On Friday,
   The Bay area's trauma has touched hearts and opened pocketbooks
the world over.
   More than $8 million has been pledged from outside the country,
$7 million from Japan. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias sent 2,500
pounds of coffee Thursday.

<HEAD>James Fenimore Cooper Is All But Forgotton on 200th Anniversary</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Fenimore Cooper would be alive
today, at least in hearts and minds, if Mark Twain hadn't hammered a
stake through the heart of Natty Bumppo.
   Cooper's demise as the quintessential author of the American
frontier stems from a quirky essay written 44 years after his death,
Dan Porter, director of the New York State Historical Association,
said.
   Mark Twain's ``Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper'' put
Deerslayer, Leatherstocking and Natty's other incarnations out to
pasture somewhere on the prairie of forgotten adventure tales. Natty
Bumppo was the frontiersman who appeared in Cooper's stories found
in the ``The Leatherstocking Tales,'' including ``The Last of the
Mohicans,'' ``The Pathfinder,'' ``The Deerslayer'' and others.
   ``Mark really did him in,'' Porter said.
   The Historical Association is celebrating the 200th anniversary
of Cooper's birth. This summer, Porter hopes to shepherd 150,000
visitors to Cooperstown's Fenimore House and the Farmer's Museum,
both devoted to pioneer life.
   Even so, that turnout will be just half the average summer gate
for the other game in town, the Baseball Hall of Fame, which
celebrated its 50th anniversary this year.
   Porter wants Cooperstown pilgrims to know that Cooper put the
town on the map a decade before reputed baseball inventor Abner
Doubleday created the sport in Cooperstown.
   Unlike Twain, who remains popular, Cooper has been ``relegated to
the status of having written adventure books for kids and shoved on
the shelves of schoolchildren who would be just as happy to shove
him back,'' said Cooper aficionado Hugh MacDougall.
   Even without Twain, the wordiness and sermonizing of ``The Last
of the Mohicans'' and ``The Deerslayer'' probably would have eroded
Cooper's popularity. Cooper had no editor, so his books were printed
the way he wrote them. He considered revising a chore.
   Twain's scorecard credits Cooper with 114 literary offenses in
just two-thirds of a page. Readers couldn't tell Cooper's living
characters from his corpses, and neither showed ``sufficient excuse
for being there,'' Twain wrote.
   Cooper's characters also made the most of dialogue, wrote Twain,
complaining that a Cooper character's mouth ``was a rolling-mill,
and busied itself all day long in turning 4-foot pigs of thought
into 30-foot bars of conversational railroad iron.''
   ``Cooper characterizations may leave something to be desired,''
his great-great-grandson Henry S.F. Cooper Jr. said. ``But he did
create one well-rounded and extraordinary character with Deerslayer.
He has the same strength and immortality as Sherlock Holmes.''
   Early America's most popular writer, Cooper was the first to
break the snob barrier and gain acclaim in Europe.
   ``In Europe his characters came to represent the typical American
of the last century,'' said MacDougall, who has written a guidebook
_ ``Cooper's Otsego County'' _ to local sites important to the
author's works. Cooper drew on the Cooperstown wilderness for many
of his settings.
   Cooper was the first novelist of the American frontier, the first
to write sea novels and the first American author to earn his living
solely as a man of letters.
   His vivid descriptions of landscapes inspired the artworks of his
friends, Thomas Cole and Samuel Morse, and other Hudson River school
painters. Nineteenth century travel books lifted entire Cooper
passages to describe the American frontier.
   ``His place in American literature is unassailable,'' said Henry
Cooper, who writes on space issues for The New Yorker. ``He really
put the American novel on the map. He created the tradition of the
lonely hero, which transcends the Western novel. You can find it in
the novels of Theodore Dreiser and others.''
   Europeans remain fascinated by Cooper's writing. A German film
crew shot a documentary about Cooper last year, and many Europeans
visit Fenimore House each year, Porter said.
   ``The harder (critics) knock him, the more he stands, like one of
those clown balloons with a weight in the bottom that keeps popping
back,'' Henry Cooper said.
   Born Sept. 15, 1789 in Burlington, N.J., Cooper was an infant
when his father moved the family to Otsego Lake, called Glimmerglass
in Cooper's novels. A land speculator, William Cooper had picked up
100,000 acres there in a bankruptcy sale, founding the village that
bears his name.
   Before he started writing in 1819, Cooper was kicked out of Yale
College because of his pranks, went to sea as a common sailor and
served in the Navy.
   His sailing years were grist for such forgotten sea novels as
``The Pilot'' and ``The Red Rover,'' works that influenced Herman
Melville and Joseph Conrad.
   Besides the five Leatherstocking novels, works of social
criticism were among Cooper's 50 books, including a novel about
totalitarianism predating George Orwell's ``1984'' by more than a
century.
   William Eastman, director of the State University of New York
Press, which is publishing Cooper works that have been out of print
for decades, thinks the new Cooper editions will take the bite out
of Twain's essay.
   ``His earlier manuscripts and books were so corrupt, full of
typos and errors, that people sometimes didn't know what he was
writing about,'' Eastman said. ``All those funny things Twain wrote
about were caused by typos. Those things are no longer relevant with
these new editions.''
   ``We're going back to his original manuscripts and correcting the
errors,'' said James Beard, a Cooper specialist at Clark University
in Worcester, Mass., who is working on the new editions. ``Each time
they were reprinted they made new errors.''
   Bypassed by railroads and canals, Cooperstown retains many of its
19th century landmarks. Businesses along the village's narrow
streets also help remind visitors of Cooper's legacy _ Glimmerglass
Restaurant, Mohican Motel, Leatherstocking Travel.
   Cooper lived most of his life in Cooperstown and is buried in his
family's private cemetery there, 100 miles northeast of Twain's
grave in Elmira. Cooper died in 1851.
   Otsego Lake has largely escaped the 20th century, as well. With
no large industries and much of the lakeshore acreage owned by large
landowners, the lake remains pristine compared to those in the
Adirondacks to the north. Credited as the first conservation writer,
Cooper urged preservation of natural resources in many of his books.
   ``Would Cooper be pleased at the condition of his lake? Compared
with other lakes today, yes. Compared with the lake he remembers,
probably no,'' said biologist Bill Harman. Harman heads Oneonta
State College's Biological Field Station on Otsego Lake.
   Cooper became irascible and wrote little in his last years,
instead suing critics for libel and neighbors for trespassing. It
would have been time better spent writing, Porter said.
   Cooper never endeared himself to his public in the way that
turned Alcott, Hawthorne and Thoreau into tourism industries in New
England, he said.
   ``New York has not treated its literary lights well, not as well
as New England has,'' Porter said. ``Had Cooper been less of a
curmudgeon and more in tune with public relations, his fate would
have been better today.''

BROTHERS FIND WAY TO KEEP CAPS CAPTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

In his younger years, Bill Zamboni demonstrated the family penchant for 
invention by designing a pressurized wineskin. He developed a prototype with a 
hose to squirt the wine into his mouth, then abandoned the idea after 
concluding "the market would be a little too small." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he gave up too easily, for more recently he has cultivated a market for 
an invention that at first blush seems even more obscure: a hat leash. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 10-inch-long strip of nylon cord with a badge clip attached to one end 
and a loop at the other. Bill has taken out a patent on it. Last year, he and 
his younger brother, Don, sold more than 10,000 of them. It will keep your 
baseball cap attached to your collar, if not your head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Following Footsteps 
</P>
<P>
With such an unlikely product, the Zamboni brothers are following in the 
creative footsteps of their grandfather, Frank J. Zamboni, who invented the 
Zamboni ice resurfacing machine that has become a fixture at intermissions of 
hockey games, as well as a standing gag in the "Peanuts" cartoon strip. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Frank Zamboni designed the resurfacing machine because he wanted a 
quicker way to groom the ice in his Paramount skating rink in the 1940s, Bill 
Zamboni dreamed up his hat leash because he tired of losing his favorite 
baseball caps to the ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed it myself," said Bill, 30, who lives in Long Beach. "I used to 
work at a ski resort. I love to ski with a baseball hat, I always have." But 
when he whizzed down the ski slope, the hat would whiz off his head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Grew 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1985, he took action: He got a piece of string and a couple of 
alligator clips, attaching the back of his cap to the back of his collar. From 
such humble tinkering came what is now officially known as the Kap Keeper. 
</P>
<P>
His friends asked him to make some for them. Then a buyer from Mammoth 
Mountain, a ski resort in the Sierra Nevada, inquired about them. He and his 
brother started assembling them in his brother's Bellflower garage. They were 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
At a suggested retail price of $3, the Kap Keeper is perhaps the cheapest thing 
to be found on a skier. But it's not just an inexpensive gadget, Bill stresses, 
"It's a functional product" that can save untold heartache along with your cap. 
He recounts the tale of the man who lost his cap this winter while on the 
slopes. "He went to get it and skied into a tree and broke his leg." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marketing Dreams 
</P>
<P>
If only he'd had a Kap Keeper. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers work part-time on their hat leash enterprise, while holding jobs 
elsewhere: Bill with a liquor distribution firm in Hollywood, and Don with a 
company that manufactures machines that wash airplanes. They also have a 
part-time employee who handles marketing, and they pay someone in Bellflower to 
make the hat leashes on a piecework basis. 
</P>
<P>
They have dreams of getting bigger, of going beyond the skier market to rein in 
the other wandering caps of this world. They are introducing the leash to 
boaters and fishermen, and they have approached professional baseball players, 
but there seems to be some concern that a $3 hat leash may get in the way of a 
multimillion-dollar home run swing. 
</P>
<P>
But there's always the Little League.

SAY 'BYE TO CHARLIE HUSTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It must be remembered that in last August's binding agreement between baseball 
commissioner Bart Giamatti and Pete Rose it was never spelled out that Rose bet 
on baseball games, the sin for which he was banished from the game. 
</P>
<P>
He was not accused of it, and his hot denials figured in the daily dairy of the 
case that lingered for six months. Why, then, did Rose agree to accept 
baseball's maximum punishment -- exile forever? Because they were dancing 
around all the implicits of the agreement: that Rose had been caught betting on 
ball games and was getting baseball's life sentence. It was to gain his end 
that Giamatti agreed to make no definite charges, and additionally specified 
that Rose could apply for reinstatement in a year. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Rose, who recognized the weight of evidence against him, knew he was 
a dead duck, and grasped at the face-saving factor of the right to reapply, 
which would give his case a better light. 
</P>
<P>
But that last condition was merely part of the charades. Fifteen men have been 
barred from baseball, and none was reinstated. After his pact with Rose, 
Giamatti the next day said of Rose, "Yes, I have concluded he bet on baseball 
games, including those of the Reds." 
</P>
<P>
The reapply-in-a-year stuff was put in best perspective by a high source in the 
commissioner's office who said "we won't quibble about the language if Rose is 
agreeing to accept the electric chair." Rose's chances of being reinstated in a 
year, or ever, it must be concluded, are about as rosy as Pete's next five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
That prison sentence he drew for filing false tax returns immediately raised 
the question of Rose's prospect of ever being voted into baseball's Hall of 
Fame, for which he would be eligible in 1992. Is he so tarnished that 
Cooperstown would be diminished by Pete Rose's induction? There are all shades 
of opinion, voiced immediatedly in the newspapers, on television, on talk 
shows, all of which started the Pete Rose thing as an intriguing topic. 
</P>
<P>
The case is made, of course, that Cooperstown is populated by heroes who were 
no models of deportment. Babe Ruth and some others were known to be egregious 
womanizers; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker were accused of betting on ball games 
(they were cleared). But no convicted felon was ever honored with enshrinement 
at Cooperstown. That line against Rose may have been drawn long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has made election to Cooperstown a passion, saying his glorious baseball 
record, including the 4,256 hits that surpassed Cobb's record, should be a 
consideration (some spoilsports would note that it took Rose more than 2,000 
more times at bat than Cobb needed to set the record). But there can be no 
gainsaying what Rose did on the diamond. He was a great ballplayer. The 
opinions on Rose have been coming in from everywhere. Even former president 
Nixon chipped in with the belief that Rose should be in the Hall of Fame, which 
may or may not be a plus; many writers with the ballot would vote against Rose 
now, but say they would be willing to reconsider his case in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
A most poignant opinion was voiced by the Houston Chronicle's Harry Shattuck: 
"I'm still inclined to vote for him because he has Hall of Fame credentials as 
a player. But I hope the good people at Cooperstown put his statue and 
memorabilia in a dark corner of the museum with a sign that says 'Off Limits To 
Children' because he is no role model." 
</P>
<P>
It is to be remembered that the Hall of Fame voting must be based, in a large 
measure, on "a player's integrity, sportsmanship and character." In addition to 
the commissioner's office, Uncle Sam would also be a hostile witness in those 
important matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame is for heroes. Pete Rose is no hero. He was a great 
ballplayer, but hardly a person to evoke admiration and appoint to the game's 
highest honor. Who now, would want to elevate Pete Rose? He will not get my 
vote.

<LEADPARA>  Two of the biggest names in American business reported losses today,
spotlighting the economy's weakness.;   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. said it lost $72.3
million in its fourth quarter despite efforts to trim inventories and lure
customers, and the giant retailer predicted a less-than-buoyant Christmas
season.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MACY, CBS POST LOSSES IN QUARTER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Meanwhile, CBS Inc. said today it lost $169.1 million in the third quarter,
reflecting an enormous decline in the value of the media company's contracts
to televise baseball and football.;   Macy's loss for the final fiscal quarter
ended Aug. 3 narrowed 10 percent from an $80 million shortfall in the year-ago
period, but was still weaker than expected.;   Sales totaled $1.63 billion,
roughly equivalent to the 1990 period.;   Macy is one of the biggest and
best-known American merchants, and its performance is considered an important
indicator not only of the company's own health but the state of the U.S.
retailing industry. The company doesn't report per-share results because it is
privately owned.;   For the fiscal year, the retailer lost $150.2 million on
sales of $6.76 billion. That compares with a loss of $215.3 million on sales
of $7.27 billion for the previous fiscal year.;   In a letter to investors,
Macy Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Finkelstein called the results
disappointing despite the difficult economic climate.;   Macy also announced
the creation of a new division that will operate clearance stores. In an
effort to keep inventories lean, the retailer said it plans to open five units
-- called Macy's Close-Out -- by spring that will sell primarily discounted
clothing. The first is scheduled to open this month in a mall in south
Florida.;   In addition to its Macy stores, the company owns the Bullock's and
I. Magnin stores on the West Coast. All told, the company runs 144 department
stores as well as several specialty store chains stocked with the company's
private label clothing.;   At CBS, problems were aggravated by a decision two
years ago to pay more than $3.5 billion for multiyear contracts to broadcast
major league baseball and National Football League games, college basketball
and the next two Winter Olympics.;   But the proliferation of sports
programming on TV and the advertising recession have made it impossible for
the CBS Television network to charge as much for commercial time as had been
expected, CBS officials said.;   CBS said it lost $169.1 million, or $11.11 a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 in contrast to a profit of $43.5
million, or $1.69 a share, a year earlier.;   The latest results were reduced
by $195.5 million after taxes to account for anticipated future losses on the
baseball and football contracts.;   The latest write-down, an accounting step
taken to show an asset's decline in value, comes on top of $55 million in
losses and another $115 million write-down that CBS took on the baseball
contract in the fourth quarter of 1990.;   Revenue for the third quarter fell
5 percent to $625.6 million this year from $661.9 million a year earlier.  </TEXT>

Cecil Fielder is walking through yet another bizarre afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The sports announcer for Japanese-based Fuji Television is trying his best not 
to crack while interviewing Fielder. Displaying patience in the face of 
technical adversity, the announcer presses on, mumbling a question in Japanese 
that is passed on by a translator to Fielder, who leans forward in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
A choral group is rehearsing the national anthem, and amplified voices in 
perfect harmony bounce off the seats at the Oakland Coliseum. It is like a 
sound check for the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The technicians are going berserk. The announcer is growing furious. But 
Fielder is smiling, gulping for air, trying to suppress laughter while 
completing the interview. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't he be laughing? 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, born in the U.S.A., rejected in Canada and rejuvenated in Japan, is in 
the most charmed summer of his baseball life. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has emerged as perhaps the most compelling and unbelievable figure of 
this baseball season, materializing like some samurai Roy Hobbs after a year's 
stay in Japan and finding his way back to a new home with the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday night's game at the the Kansas City Royals, Fielder was the 
American League leader in home runs (25), was second in RBI (63) and was 
batting .295 (79 for 268). He also was third among American League first 
basemen in fan balloting for the All-Star Game, July 10 at Chicago's Wrigley 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
Despite not hitting a home run since June 17, Fielder is threatening to become 
the sixth American Leaguer to hit more than 50 in a season, joining the 
exclusive group of Roger Maris, Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Hank Greenberg and 
Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit batting coach Vada Pinson calls Fielder "an angel in disguise." 
All-Star shortstop Alan Trammell says Fielder has carried the Tigers "like no 
player I've ever seen." And Manager Sparky Anderson says, "No one could have 
predicted what Cecil has done." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fielder remains a mystery, a man drafted by the Baltimore Orioles, signed 
by the Royals, developed by the Toronto Blue Jays and given a second baseball 
life in Japan with the Hanshin Tigers. Fielder is a power hitter who learned 
patience and a labeled failure who discovered success. In short, he embodies 
the baseball belief that what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary is 
sometimes nothing more, or less, than opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed a chance," Fielder said. "My career was almost over before it 
began." 
</P>
<P>
The raw numbers say Fielder is 26, stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 230 pounds. He is 
big. George Foreman big. If polyester could talk, it would shriek each time 
Fielder slips his uniform on. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder also is playful and soft-spoken. Invariably, he can be found in the 
Tigers' clubhouse wrestling a teammate to the floor and laughing with delight. 
</P>
<P>
So how on earth did someone so large, with a joyous personality to match, slip 
through baseball's cracks and fall all the way to Japan? And then come back 
again? 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy," said Oakland Athletics General Manager Sandy Alderson. "Things 
like that happen all the time. That's how the Baltimore Orioles come up with a 
Mickey Tettleton or the Oakland Athletics pick up a Dave Stewart. This game is 
full of surprises." 
</P>
<P>
But this goes beyond surprise. Twice this season, Fielder has hit three home 
runs in a game. He is as powerful pulling the ball to left field with a wicked 
wave of his 35-inch bat as he is driving the ball the opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
"With Cecil, you throw the ball, and then you pray," said Oakland's Stewart. 
"The man hits everything." 
</P>
<P>
Even Oakland's Jose Canseco, baseball's first $5 million a year player and one 
of the game's most feared home-run hitters, is a Fielder fan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the power hitters who barely hit home runs," Canseco said. "Spare 
me the grief. But Cecil, he not only hits it, but he hits it a long way." 
</P>
<P>
The moral to the story: Never give up on a big man with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder was a three-sport star at Nogales High School in La Puente, a 
melting-pot community near Los Angeles. Basketball was his first love. He was a 
starting point guard as a 14-year-old freshman and led the team to a state 
playoff semifinal during his senior season in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In football, Fielder played linebacker and was used as a quarterback on long 
passing downs. Baseball was just something Fielder played to occupy time during 
the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
John Romano, the Nogales' baseball coach, recalls Fielder's hitting 
tape-measure home runs that sent balls bouncing onto golf courses, skipping 
down streets and soaring over houses. 
</P>
<P>
"He really wanted to play basketball in college," Romano said. "But basketball 
coaches didn't like his body. He was 6 feet 2 and 218 pounds. It was his 
father, Edson, who convinced him to play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Hailed as a possible heir to Willie Upshaw at first base or Cliff Johnson at 
designated hitter, Fielder failed to meet the expectations of the Blue Jays. In 
parts of four fitful seasons, Fielder hit 31 home runs and drove in 84 runs in 
506 at-bats, but he became lost in the shuffle as the Blue Jays developed Fred 
McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Jays didn't have any room for me," Fielder said. "I was the odd man 
out. I never complained. I never said I wanted to get out of here. I'm glad 
they gave me the opportunity to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
What the Blue Jays gave Fielder was a chance to play for Hanshin in Japan for 
$1 million, plus perks that included a furnished apartment for his family, a 
satellite-television dish to pick up American baseball games and a personal 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder terrorized Japanese Central League pitchers in 1989, hitting .302 with 
38 home runs. His first homer was a 500-foot shot that slammed into a King Kong 
poster at the Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the monkey in the leg," he said. "I thought they were going to give me a 
watch. Some of my teammates even thought I might get a car. But I didn't get 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder received only polite encouragement from his teammates, who consider 
foreign domination foul play. Although he was prepared to remain in Japan for 
another season, Fielder feared for his security when another American, Larry 
Parrish, was released after leading the Yakult Swallows in home runs. Fielder 
exercised an option, received his release and auctioned his services to the 
highest American bidder. 
</P>
<P>
There was no war. The Tigers were the only team to show an interest in Fielder, 
signing him for $3 million for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at it as a gamble," Detroit general manager Bill Lajoie said. "I 
knew he could hit and hit with power. He had better statistics than any 
Triple-A minor-league player in this country." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Fielder put up numbers that, if generated throughout the season, 
would have given him a 68-homer pace. Inevitably, he cooled off. But, with a 
power hitter, another streak may be around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"When Cecil goes 0-for-4, people think he's slipping," Tigers outfielder Lloyd 
Moseby said. "But he'll be OK. This man is going to be the Most Valuable Player 
of the American League." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder will hear none of that. Comparisons to Maris and Ruth are useless. MVP 
talk is silly. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted was a chance," he said.

   Around Christmas 1965, some Major League baseball
veterans, concerned about the game's pension plan, determined
that the association that had been representing them in a
desultory manner should be beefed up by the hiring of a
full-time executive director. To that end, they arranged an
interview with Marvin Miller, a well-regarded bargainer for
the United Steelworkers of America.
   At the outset of his new book, "A Whole Different Ball
Game: The Sport and Business of Baseball" (Birch Lane Press,
430 pages, $21.95), Mr. Miller relates that at the meeting
the players informed him that if he were hired they had in
mind someone to assist him as general counsel: Richard M.
Nixon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With such a mind-set, it was remarkable that the players
would offer the job to a hard-core unionist like Mr. Miller.
And, given that glimpse into the baseball psyche, it's more
remarkable that he took it (without, as it turned out,
committing himself to accepting the aid and comfort of Mr.
Nixon).
   Most remarkable, though, was the association's record
during the Brooklyn-born economist's 17 years as its leader,
ending in 1983. During his tenure, impartial arbitration was
substituted for owner-imposed settlements of grievances, the
"reserve clause" that bound a player to his team at the
team's pleasure was ruled invalid, and the player salary
average began its rocketlike ascent from $19,000 to today's
nearly $900,000. It's certainly a whole different ball game,
in ways that still are evolving.
   Mr. Miller's book, written with the help of Allen Barra,
details the struggles that led to those gains, and these were
remarkable, too. To say the owners had things their own way
before he came along would be an understatement. The lords of
the baseball were (and still are) exempt from the nation's
antitrust laws, never gave the players copies of many of the
documents that bound them, and, when they felt changes were
in order, simply had their appointed commissioner announce
them unilaterally. A player running afoul of the game's
powers-that-be was in the same situation as a stranger
arrested in "one of those tiny towns where the sheriff also
turns out to be the judge and the mayor," Mr. Miller writes.
   Moreover, as he notes in several contexts, some of the men
he represented were ignorant of or hostile to the role of
unions in protecting workers' interests, and many were
apathetic over issues they perceived as not directly
involving them. For instance, no player showed up in court to
give moral support to Curt Flood in his 1970 legal assault on
the reserve clause, or to hear arguments in the owner's
(unsuccessful) suit to overturn the five-years-later
arbitrator's ruling that killed the infamous rule and allowed
the players to flex their market muscle.
   But he goes on to say that years of labor strife in
baseball, including the strike of 1972 and the lockout of
1976, paid off in player solidarity during the 50-day, 1981
walkout over the owners' bid for "warmbody" compensation for
lost free agents. Given the fact that most players never
perform long enough to attain free agency, Mr. Miller calls
the '81 strike the "most-principled" he'd been associated
with in a 40-plus-year labor career.
   Mr. Miller opines that his union did have allies, but not
ones you'd expect. Team owners, he says, always could be
counted upon to do or say things that would stiffen members'
backbones at crucial times.
   He continues that the players' best friend -- next to
himself, of course -- was Bowie Kuhn, baseball's commissioner
for most of his time with the players' group. Mr. Miller's
low regard for and asserted gratitude to the starchy Mr. Kuhn
punctuates his book. "If Bowie Kuhn had never existed," he
summarizes, paraphrasing Voltaire on God, "we would have had
to invent him."
   That view is payback for Mr. Kuhn's assessment of Mr.
Miller in his 1987 book, "Hardball," in which he called the
union chief "sly," a "mean-spirited badger," and -- insult of
insults -- "not a fan." Marvin, however, one-ups Bowie by
making him seem pathetic as well as inept. I mean, where else
in the annals of labor relations has a management rep (Kuhn)
been depicted as approaching a union negotiator (Miller)
before contract talks and asking for leniency because "the
owners need a victory"?
   Such lack of sportsmanship is only one bone I have to pick
with this book. Mr. Miller repeatedly lumps news people as
the owners' lackeys when my own observation was that his
union's positions received a fair airing from much of the
press. And he spends much space defending his credentials as
a baseball fan instead of merely noting that they were
irrelevant to the job he was hired to perform.
   It's clear, though, that the players did better than they
knew when they hired Mr. Miller, and his story is well worth
our attention. He brought to a very public enterprise the
sort of honestly adversarial relationship between labor and
management that we hold up as desirable, and that benefits us
all.

   Take Me in to the Ball Game

   Houston -- The Astrodome here passed its 25th birthday
this year, and it would be nice if, sometime during the
annum, we each light a sparkler to mark it.
   I suggest a sparkler not only because it would be festive,
but also because the device has a place in Astrodome history.
In the indoor ballpark's earlier days, its humongous
electronic scoreboard would erupt into a lengthy and
excessive display every time a Houston Astro hit a home run.
This prompted some opposing players to light sparklers in
countercelebration of their teammates' four-baggers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The big scoreboard is gone, removed in a recent expansion
of the Dome's seating capacity. Gone, too, is the apartment
its creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, maintained in the upper deck
behind right-center field, the presidential suite he built
for his pal, Lyndon B. Johnson (but which LBJ never
occupied), and the medieval-style chapel he installed in case
guests felt the need for prayer or meditation.
   The presidential suite was a special stunner. Designed by
Harper Goff, whose previous credits included sets for the
movie "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," it featured
chandeliers, statuary, a rug bearing the presidential seal,
and canopied twin beds covered in regal purple. Once asked if
the effect wasn't a bit gaudy, the late judge is said to have
replied, "Maybe, but you'll remember it, won't you?"
   Much the same thing can be said for the Astrodome as a
whole. You don't hear much about its being the "eighth wonder
of the world" anymore, now that Toronto and Montreal boast
indoor ballparks with roofs that retract, but the place's
place as a pacesetter will ever be secure. It was the first
domed and air-conditioned baseball-football stadium, the
first to sport an artificial playing surface, and the first
to have corporate "luxury suites." When Houston's
rank-and-file fans didn't rise up and murder their occupants,
the suites became the bedrock of new-stadium financing.
   "Whether you like it or not, we're in show business,"
declared the judge in 1965, when his brainchild opened. And
American sports have never been the same since.
   Judge Hofheinz, stout and bespectacled, was a prototypical
Texas politician-entrepreneur who titled his autobiography
"The Grand Huckster." He first envisaged an indoor stadium
for his sultry home town, a city of shiny skyscrapers and
shinier foreheads, after visiting the Colosseum in Rome and
learning that the structure once had a huge "velarium," or
awning, that could be unrolled in inclement weather.
   He discussed the matter with the architect Buckminster
Fuller, inventor of the geodesic dome, and came away
convinced "that it was possible to cover any size space if
you don't run out of money." The Astrodome cost $36.5
million, which was a lot then but not so much now; the
1988-89 remodeling job cost about $50 million.
   The Dome was a hit at first, drawing 2,151,470 spectators
to Astro games its initial season, triple the number of the
year before, and thousands more for tours to view its
splendors. Judge Hofheinz branched out on the site, building
convention facilities, hotels and an amusement park, all with
"Astro" in their names. His Astro-naming craze extended to an
early baseball program, which provided fans with space to
collect "Astrografs."
   Astromania would be shortlived. When the novelty of the
Dome wore off, Houston proved to be a tough-nut sports town,
and sellouts remain rare even for the pro-football Oilers. In
the middle 1970s, with seasonal baseball attendance below the
one million mark, the Hofheinz empire unraveled, and
creditors had to step in for a time and operate his
properties.
   The Dome's, and the Astros', current proprietor is the
Houston Sports Association, which leases the building from
Harris County. It books about 200 dates a year with things
like rodeos and tractor pulls in addition to baseball and
football, and usually runs close to breaking even, no small
achievement for an enterprise of its sort.
   "September baseball is our key -- if the Astros are
playing well, they'll draw enough people to put us in the
black," says Adam Richards, HSA's treasurer. Since the team's
second and last National League Western Division title, in
1986, they have, he adds.
   Withal, the Astrodome has stood up well during its first
quarter-century. Its seats for baseball, its main activity,
are comfortable and close to the field, and parking is
plentiful and cheap ($3). Dome management courts the family
trade by keeping the place tidy and leveling a close eye on
rowdies. "First, we ask 'em to hold it down, and if they
don't, we ask 'em to leave," notes Gary Weaver, one of the
building's red-jacketed security men.
   If there have been complaints about the building, they've
come mainly from ballplayers, not fans. Whatever else the
Astrodome may be, it's also the toughest park in the National
League in which to hit home runs. During the 1980s, just 702
batted balls cleared the fences here, fewer than half as many
as at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the league's most-generous
venue.
   "A lot of awfully hard-hit balls wind up as simple
fly-outs here. It can get really frustrating," says Glen
Davis, the reigning Astro strong boy, who has hit more homers
on the road than at home over his five-year career. His
theory is that sea-level Houston's hot and soggy summer air
overpowers the Dome's air-conditioning and stifles potential
round-trippers.
   It's been said that the Dome's cushioned seats and
decorous atmosphere, coupled with the prevailing
power-hitting failure, has created a laid-back local fandom
that's been less than an asset to Astro teams. "Some players
used to say it was more like a theater than a ballpark, and
that makes it tough to get up for games," notes Larry
Dierker, who pitched for the Astros for 14 years and now is
one of the team's broadcasters.
   He adds, "I never agreed with that view, but sure I
understood it. Heck, the place is more like a theater than a
ballpark."

   Bumping Hips and Heads in Box Lacrosse
   ----

<LP>
   Philadelphia -- The Indians of the American Northeast
invented the sport of lacrosse more than 500 years ago. They
called it "baggataway," which meant "bumping hips." The game
has undergone many changes since, not all of them in the
direction of greater refinement.
   On Sunday, for example, the Detroit Turbos of the Major
Indoor Lacrosse League journeyed to the City of Brotherly
Love to play the hometown Wings, and their contest was marked
by several fights, all of which involved the bumping of more
than hips.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A guy jumps you, you gotta defend yourself," said husky
Paul Gait, the Detroit rookie star, who bumped his fist
against the face of the Wings' equally husky John Tucker in
the third quarter of the 14-12 Turbo win, and had his face
bumped by Tucker's fist in return. "That's the kind of game
this is," Gait added, unneccessarily. "You can't show your
skills if you're intimidated."
   Gait et al. had just showed their skills to a near-full
house of 16,622 in the Spectrum on this sunny Sunday,
indicating either that lacrosse is catching on or that folks
hereabouts lack other entertainments. Its promoters weren't
fussy about which. "This is great]" enthused Chris Fritz, the
league's president. "It shows we're on track to make lacrosse
America's No. 5 sport." Right behind baseball, football,
basketball and luge, I guess.
   In case you've never seen lacrosse, I'll explain it to
you. The outdoor game is played on a large, grassy field with
lots of players, most of them from Baltimore. The indoor
version, the one the MILL plays, is Canadian in origin,
invented to give hockey rinks some utility during that
nation's brief summer. Its name there is "box lacrosse,"
suggesting a link with the pugilistic sport.
   Artificial turf covers the ice and there are six players
to a side, including a goalie. All the others are called
forwards, perhaps so as to not confuse them about the
direction of the opposition's goal.
   Each player carries a stick with a netted loop on its end.
The stick is used to catch, throw and shoot the ball (it must
be shot rather quickly; there's a 40-second clock) and to
whack other players. Hitting a ball carrier is permissible so
long as the blow does not land on his head or below the
knees. Nonetheless, players distrust each other's aim and
wear stout helmets with full-cage face masks.
   The MILL now is in its fifth campaign, and has teams in
New York, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Worcester, Mass., in
addition to Motown and Philly. Each plays a 10-game,
weekends-only schedule ending March 23, followed by a
championship game matching the winners of the league's two
divisions. There are only three of those, so no one finishes
worse than third.
   The league owns all the teams, and turned a profit last
season, thank you. This is partly because it holds players'
base salaries to a modest $125 to $300 a game. Even with
season-ending performance bonuses, that comes to less
annually than Roger Clemens loses behind his sofa cushions.
   The MILL also thrives because it has confined itself
largely to the Northeast, where a lacrosse-fan base exists.
Leaguewide attendance has been good, averaging 11,000 a game
last season, and about the same so far this one. According to
MILL demographic research, it's a well-heeled crowd, the
average fan being a 30-year-old bond trader who drives a BMW,
reads Playboy, has 2.6 girlfriends, carries an immense load
of credit-card debt and enjoys watching people beat one
another with sticks.
   Many of the players also fit the yuppie mold, thanks to
their Eastern-collegiate backgrounds and day jobs. Some are
lawyers, bankers, stockbrokers or real-estate developers.
Others have respectable jobs.
   The two fellas that may make the thing go, though, still
are undergraduates at Syracuse University. They are the
twin-brothers Gait, Paul and Gary. The 23-year-old natives of
Victoria, B.C., were All-Americans on Syracuse teams that won
several NCAA titles. Their college eligibility expired before
they got their degrees, and they have stayed on to get same
while performing with the pros.
   The Gaits are the Michael Jordans of lacrosse, noted for
their stick-handling and acrobatic skills. Among the moves
they have pioneered is the "Air Gait," in which they leap out
from behind the hockey-like goal and fling in the ball as
they fly past, without violating the "crease" area, into
which only the goalie may tread.
   They're so good that their addition has lifted the Detroit
team from the league's worst last season, with a 1-7 won-lost
record, to first place currently, at 5-1. Paul's two goals
Sunday set his season total at 30, breaking the league's
single-season record with four games yet to play. Gary had
three assists to break that mark, plus three goals.
   "You wonder how good we'd be if we could practice together
more," mused Medo Martinello, the Turbos' coach. He explained
that the Gait boys rarely make it to Detroit for workouts,
and that the occupational obligations of team members who
live locally also interfere. "Even I can't make it
sometimes," noted Martinello, who owns a couple of pizzerias
in Windsor, Ont.
   But if rehearsal was lacking, Sunday's production came off
well. Besides the pushing, shoving and hacking, the players
handled the ball with considerable flair; most notable were
Turbo breakaways begun by long passes from goalie Ted Sawicki
that would have done Dan Marino proud. Detroit jumped to a
3-0 lead and saw the Wings rally to an 11-10 edge before
breaking the game with four consecutive last-period goals.
   And afterward, icing their bruises, the players spoke not
of their meager salaries but of how good it was to be able to
continue their sport at all. "If it weren't for the league,
most of us would be playing for nothing," said Turbo forward
Jacques Monte, a coach at the College of Wooster in Ohio. "Of
course," he added, "that's just about what we're doing now."

<TEXT>     It was the first of many times baseball has been presented to me as an
allegory for life. In a sports-minded society, I suppose that is inevitable.
And not without justification.;    To some extent, at least, sports and life
require many of the same ingredients for success. You have to set goals, work
hard, pull your share of the load and work well with others. You need talent,
an understanding of the game and a measure of luck.;    But the older and more
experienced I get, the more I see life in terms of games other than baseball.
Now that I am both middle-class and middle-aged, for example, there are two
childhood games that seem much more fitting: dodge ball and keep away.;    In
life, as in dodge ball and keep away, the main thing is to stay out of the
middle.;    The middle is for suckers.;    Take middle management, for
example. I did, but only for a while. Then I realized it was a sucker's game.
After the initial glow of achievement and recognition wears off, you're left
with more responsibility than authority. You take the blame, but not the
credit.;    In dodge ball, the middle is also fun at first. You're the center
of attention, surrounded and outnumbered, daring others to try to hit you with
the ball.;    But if you are stranded in the center of the circle for any
length of time, it gets tiresome, then frustrating, then maddening.;    Even
worse, as games go, is keep away (a.k.a. monkey in the middle). Now there is a
game invented by sadists, a game that brings out the worst in everyone who
plays it.;    The rules are simple: Two or more people throw a ball back and
forth, keeping it away from the "monkey" in the middle, who jumps and runs to
and fro, vainly trying to get it.;    The temptation to tease the monkey is
almost overwhelming. Sometimes a player will hold the ball just out of reach,
cruelly flipping it to a partner at the last moment.;    Often, the resulting
frustration drives the one in the middle to abandon not only the rules of the
game but the rules of civility. As I recall, more than one game of keep away
ended with a fight.;    As a frustrated American taxpayer, I'm in the middle
and I sometimes feel like fighting, too. Like last week, for example, when I
read the story about President Bush trying to get the Internal Revenue Service
to lay off the corporate tax cheaters and go after middle-class cheaters
instead.;    As we all know, many corporations pay less in taxes than some of
us who are trying to support families, pay mortgages and put kids through
college. Some of them pay nothing at all.;    When you consider that
corporations can afford the best tax specialists, it's far more likely that
mistakes are intentional. For the rest of us slobs, who either do our own tax
returns or pay a small fee to someone who spends an hour or so putting them
together, mistakes are more likely to be unintentional.;    But the president
wants his big-shot friends left alone. Better, he says, to nail the little
guy, the guy in the middle.;    Fools that we are, we will re-elect him, too.;
   Yeah, you've got to be a real chump to be in the middle. Which makes those
of us who live in Florida perhaps the biggest chumps of all.;    Currently, we
are in the middle of a gargantuan lawsuit filed by the federal government
against the South Florida Water Management District and state regulators over
pollution of the Everglades.;    To date, we have spent $5.8 million as state
taxpayers to defend the suit, and goodness knows how much as federal taxpayers
to prosecute it. Apparently both sides are determined to do whatever it takes
to win, no matter how much it costs taxpayers.;    In other words, no matter
which side wins, those of us in the middle end up losers.  </TEXT>

BLUE-GRAY: COLLEGE ALL-STAR CONTEST WILL FEATURE CHARLIE FINLEY'S 
FLUORESCENT-STRIPED FOOTBALL.

The Blue-Gray All-Star game gives Charlie Finley a chance to prove that the 
pigskin could use a little color, and some small-college players an opportunity 
to show they can make it in the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, as owner of the Oakland Athletics, introduced baseball to brightly 
colored uniforms and white shoes, the designated hitter and an orange baseball. 
Now he's pushing a fluorescent-striped football. 
</P>
<P>
The ball, which already has been tried by high schools in nine states, will be 
used for the first time at the college level when the North meets the South in 
the Christmas Day game (9 a.m. PST, Ch. 7). 
</P>
<P>
Finley's invention is a regulation football with eight fluorescent-yellow 
stripes running its length. He said the stripes make it easier for spectators, 
and the players, to keep up with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had difficulty following the football," Finley said. "I think that 
we, the television viewers, are certainly entitled to be able to follow the 
ball. If you can't see the ball, you can't enjoy the game." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said the ball has received favorable reviews, but this will be the first 
test in a nationally televised game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about the colleges," Finley said. "If the high schools approve 
of the ball, the college and pros will both follow suit. They'll be forced to 
use it. The fans and spectators will force them to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Finley was in Hot Springs, Ark., last week to show the ball to Joe Reese, 
president of the National Federation of Interscholastic Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Reese said he plans to introduce legislation when the coaches' group meets next 
month in Tucson, Ariz., that would allow all high schools the option of using 
the striped ball, which also will be used next month at the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue-Gray game features small-college stars and Division I players whose 
teams were not invited to a bowl -- either because of their record or, in 
Houston's case, because the team is on probation. Five Cougars will play for 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Bailey of Texas A&amp;I, college football's all-time leading rusher, 
said the game is a chance to prove his record was no fluke just because the 
yardage was piled up against Division II schools. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my chance to really show the pro scouts, and the nation, what I can 
do," said Bailey, who will play for the South. "For four years, I have been 
criticized, and this is my opportunity to prove everybody wrong. This is my 
chance to show that I can compete with Division I players." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-7, 179-pound tailback rushed for 6,320 yards at Texas A&amp;I, 
surpassing the NCAA record set by Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett at 
Pittsburgh from 1973-76. Bailey was a three-time winner of the Harlon Hill 
Trophy as the top player in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
A player on the North team also has a identity problem. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho's John Friesz this year became only the eighth quarterback in NCAA 
history to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season, but he's relatively 
unknown because he plays in Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to come into the Blue-Gray game and show the nation I can play 
football," said Friesz, fifth on the NCAA's all-time passing list with 10,697 
yards. "Playing in the Big Sky Conference, players don't always get the 
recognition they deserve. I hope I can change some of that."

When the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants square off to settle 
the baseball championship of California Saturday, it will have been 129 years 
since the state's first baseball title was decided. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 20, 1860, at the State Fairgrounds in Sacramento, the San Francisco 
Eagles met the Sacramento Red Rovers for the state's championship trophy, the 
Silver Ball. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fred W. Lange in his 1938 book, "The History of Baseball in 
California and the Pacific Coast League," that was California's first big game. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles won, 31-17. 
</P>
<P>
They scored a lot of runs in those days, split-fingered fastballs being quite a 
few decades down the road. And another important difference between the World 
Series games to be held in the Bay Area and those of baseball's early years in 
California was that in the old days, you didn't have to check your guns at the 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
It was considered good clean fun then to fire your six-shooter into the air 
just as a batter was getting ready to swing. 
</P>
<P>
William Shepard, an 1860s third baseman in San Francisco, described the 
baseball environment there in his memoirs, a rich source for Lange's book. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball was loosely organized, gambling was ever present, particularly when 
the Eagles played the Pacifics," Shepard wrote. "Gamblers would place bets on 
teams . . . and fire a fusillade from their six-shooters just as a fielder was 
about to make a play." 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that organized baseball's first year in California was 1859. The 
state's first taste of big league baseball was in 1869, and it wasn't pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
The sport was brought to San Francisco in 1858 by a newcomer from Boston, 
Martin F. Cosgriff. He had bats and balls, and showed the locals how to play. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, according to Lange, a group of "tradesmen and mechanics," led by 
John M. Fisher, founded the first team on the Pacific Coast, the San Francisco 
Eagles. On Washington's Birthday in 1860, the Eagles found someone to play -- a 
new team from Sacramento, the Red Rovers. 
</P>
<P>
The first game ended in a 33-33 tie, but the Eagles declared themselves winners 
by default when the Red Rovers stalked off the field angrily, citing "unfair 
pitching" by the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
In 1861, the Eagles brought in two ringers from the east, two brothers from the 
professional New York Knickerbockers, William and James Shephard. With their 
encouragement, a second San Francisco team, the Pacifics, was formed. 
</P>
<P>
There was little baseball during the Civil War, but in 1866 baseball people 
held a convention in Sacramento and formed a California State Convention of 
Baseball Players. A constitution and rule book were published, and a league was 
formed. The convention also resulted in the construction of the first enclosed 
ball park in California, at 25th and Folsom Streets in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The new league had its ups and downs but in time proved to be the forerunner of 
the California League, which later became the Pacific Coast League, which later 
gave way to major league baseball in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
In 1867, the Eagles played a new team in Oakland, the Wide Awakes. Final score: 
Eagles 37, Wide Awakes 3. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Eagle partisans were getting cocky. They figured their guys were ready 
for anybody. So an invitation was sent eastward, to the nationally famed 
Cincinnati Red Stockings, winners of more than 50 games in a row. And in what 
must have been one of the first cross-country trips by a sports team, the Red 
Stockings came to San Francisco on the new transcontinental railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Here it gets sort of ugly. In the first game, the Red Stockings beat the 
Eagles, 35-4. They played again the next day, and the Red Stockings won, 58-4. 
Two days later, it was the Pacifics' turn to lose to Cincinnati, 66-4. Finally, 
the California League put together an all-star team, but the Red Stockings beat 
that group twice, 46-14 and 50-6. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, the Red Stockings had louder revolvers.

<HL> Will a High-Tech Bat Lure the Elite to Play Low-Rent Stickball? --- Broomstick's Rival Glitters But a Kid Calls It Weird; Willie Is Not Amazed </HL>
<AUTHOR> Michael Siconolfi (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

   Suspend Pete Rose, bash Billy Martin, string lights on Wrigley Field. 

   But why mess with the broomstick? 

   It seems that the broomstick is in danger of being swept aside as the official bat of stickball. 
Its challenger is a high-tech, high-gloss aluminum model clearly aimed at coaxing the upwardly mobile crowd into an unabashedly low-rent sport. 

   Stickball -- a street version of baseball that has flourished here since the Depression -- has never been a social climber's game. 
In between the manholes and parked cars, players simply whip back an old broomstick, keep their eyes on a cheap rubber ball and swing for the sewer grates. 
The only penalty is a quick trip around the block for whoever beans the building superintendent. 

   But now comes Martin DiSieno, a 30-year-old elevator engineer from Queens, who, in a bid for marketing stardom, recently recast the broomstick into a sleek cylindrical club called the Quick Swing. 
Buyers already have lapped up 1,000 of them through small sporting-goods stores, and Duffy Lautz, a Passaic, N.J., sporting-goods wholesaler, pronounces it "the BMW of stickball bats." 

   So, can Bloomingdale's be far behind?. 

   "It's appalling," laments Stan Fischler, a broadcaster for television's SportsChannel. 
"Stickball has gone yuppie." 

   Players agree that the Quick Swing probably hits farther than a broomstick or any of the other sticks that tend to crop up in the streets and schoolyards. 
Critics, however, say the new bat is morally equivalent to entering a yacht in a dinghy race or sneaking in a racehorse among the polo ponies. 

   Some also think the Quick Swing's $13 price tag is excessive, considering that stickball bats typically are made from castoff broomsticks. 
The inventor makes no apology for the price. 
"The kids out there are buying $50 sneakers; they're spending megabucks on clothes," Mr. DiSieno says. 

   But some people just aren't buying it. 

   The Gerry Cosby &amp; Co. sporting-goods store beneath Madison Square Garden sold about three dozen during the bat's introduction last year but only a handful this season, according to James Root, the manager. 
At Paragon, one of New York's largest sporting-goods stores, the price has the bats gathering dust instead of customers, a salesman says. 

   The cost issue is further explained by Gloria Faltermeier, a social worker who has shattered a few windows playing stickball. 
"Whenever you break a window," she says, "you have to drop your bat and run." 
And then, usually, you have to buy another bat. 

   Breaking things is part of the game. 
In a typical street version of stickball, players select a sewer grate to serve as home plate while parked autos become the bases. 
In the schoolyard or tenement version, a rectangular home plate/batter's box is chalked on a concrete wall -- pitches falling inside the lines are automatically strikes. 
Batters seek to bash the ball to the most distant car or fence or the highest apartment floor. 

   At least, aluminum bats don't shatter easily. 
In years past, the police often confiscated stickball bats, shoving them into sewer drains and snapping them in two. 
Still, the Quick Swing lacks a certain macho quality. 
Though it would "look good on Wall Street," that bat is "too pretty" for the mean streets on which stickball is played, says New York Mets announcer Tim McCarver. 

   The Quick Swing's one concession to the broomstick is a short, dense wooden handle designed to maximize bat speed (imagine swinging a hammer from the head). 
This design has made a believer of Joe Calisi, a 33-year-old computer programmer for the New York City Transit Authority. 
Warming up on a littered Queens street, he calls the Quick Swing "another piece of the evolution of athletics." 

   But another computer programmer, Justin Vincel of Colgate-Palmolive Co., says: "You shouldn't have high-tech in an old-fashioned game." 
A postal supervisor who played for years on New York's East side says of the bats: "The best use would be to recycle them, like aluminum cans." 

   Mr. Fischler's 10-year-old son, Simon, looks skeptically at the bat and concludes: "Ugh. 
It's weird." 

   The bat jeopardizes a part of baseball history, old-timers contend. 
Former Brooklyn Dodger Roy Campanella reminisces about the days when "stickball was just a five-cent ball and my mom's broomstick." 
Willie Mays, who often played stickball near the old Polo Grounds while he was a New York Giant, frowns as he whips the new bat around. 
He recalls the broomstick stump he used 30 years ago: "Now, that was a hard thing to hit with, man." 

   At the Gerry Cosby sporting goods store, salesman Orlando Torres debates the bat's marketing outlook with the store's manager, Mr. Root. 
Mr. Torres, a former New York Stock Exchange clerk uprooted by the market crash, says many people pick up the bat, swing it, then put it down. 
"Stickball is poor man's baseball," he says."They're trying to make it a money-man's game, and they can forget it." 

   But Mr. Root offers a selling point for the new bats. 
"If you're a kid," he says, "you'll get in a lot less trouble buying a $13 bat than stealing your mom's broomstick."

COVER STORY: CBS AND ESPN TAKE A SWING AT BROADCASTING BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the cry of "Play ball!" officially goes through the land this week, it 
will open a season that will see the biggest changes in who's covering baseball 
since NBC's inaugural telecast in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, whose pioneering radio and television coverage for seven decades won it 
the distinction as "The Baseball Network," found itself without the sport when 
it was outbid for the exclusive network rights in December, 1988. ABC, which 
also carried regular season games and alternated with NBC on All-Star and 
post-season telecasts since 1976, also was called out. 
</P>
<P>
In their place, CBS, which has not broadcast a game since 1964 -- and with a 
bid of just over $1 billion -- became the exclusive network home of Major 
League Baseball. CBS' coverage begins Saturday with a 10 a.m. game between the 
Dodgers and Houston Astros (on Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, baseball also has agreed to its most extensive cable network 
coverage, with ESPN winning the rights and scheduling 161 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Shaker, CBS Sports' executive producer, asks viewers to be patient with his 
network's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going in beating our chests saying we'll do baseball better than 
it's ever been done before," he said. "We go in with a deep bow to NBC and ABC 
and with a great reverence for the game. It'll take time and we'll make 
mistakes. Hopefully, we won't make them a couple of times. We'll make our own 
imprint on televising baseball, but not right out of the blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Shaker said his network plans no departures from the traditional approach to 
televising the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to re-invent the wheel," Shaker said. "NBC for the last four 
decades and ABC since 1976 set the standards for network coverage of baseball 
on television. They set a high standard, and we'll have to work really hard to 
reach that." 
</P>
<P>
The change most noticeable to viewers will come in the announcing booth. 
Instead of the play-by-play announcer holding the central role, the analyst 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Holding those roles will be longtime major league catcher and former ABC 
analyst Tim McCarver and Jim Kaat, who pitched a record 25 seasons in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim has a tremendous way of expressing himself, with great humor and 
spontaneity. He'll be able to express himself much more freely than he did at 
ABC, (which covered baseball with a three-man team) because there will be one 
less person in the booth." 
</P>
<P>
But McCarver won't be heard in Southern California until June. For the next two 
Saturdays, the duo of Kaat and St. Louis Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck will 
call the games beamed into the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to take the same approach to announcing that I did to pitching -- keep 
it simple, stupid," said Kaat, who has announced for NBC, ESPN and three major 
league teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to prepare and give the avid fan insight he can chew on, but not lose 
the casual fan by going too deep. I want to be honest, objective and 
lighthearted." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of CBS' announcing team is Greg Gumbel, who will host the studio 
wrap-around show. His brother Bryant of the "Today" show once held the same 
position at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
One tradition CBS won't be keeping is televising a game every week. After an 
April 21 game between the California Angels and Minnesota Twins, baseball will 
disappear on CBS until June 16. Games will be televised each Saturday 
thereafter through Aug. 25, when there will be another hiatus until Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
But the void will be more than made up by cable. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will carry double-headers Tuesdays and Fridays and single games Sunday and 
Wednesday evenings. ESPN's coverage begins Monday with an opening-day game at 
11:30 a.m. between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox, followed by a 5 
p.m. Chicago Cubs-Philadelphia Phillies contest. 
</P>
<P>
According to Loren Matthews, ESPN's senior vice president in charge of 
programming, the key to his network's broadcasts will not come from the 
ballparks but from its Bristol, Conn., studios. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we'll be able to go to other games, predominantly on a 
quick turnaround tape basis to show what's going on," Matthews said. "For 
extraordinary occurrences, we will have even greater latitude of bringing live 
the significance of Nolan Ryan's 300th win or a long hitting streak being on 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
The all-sports cable network also will air "Baseball Tonight," a nightly 
scores, highlights, features and analysis show hosted by John Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to put the season into perspective, instead of just reporting it 
as a series of games," said "Baseball Tonight" coordinating producer Eric 
Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
"If you watch the weekly baseball shows, it's tough for them to pick out the 
three or four most pivotal moments. Because we'll be there every night, we'll 
have pivotal moments every night, spotting trends, anticipating upcoming trends 
and saying why each game is meaningful."

   Are Off Their Game

   GONE are the good old days when people would flock to pay
dearly for the latest in high-tech sporting equipment. The
sporting goods industry, holding its annual Super Show in
Atlanta this weekend, is resigned to slower growth now and
years into the future.
   The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association projects
sales will rise 5% this year to $33.14 billion. That isn't
much better than last year's estimated 4.4% increase, and is
well below the double-digit gains of the 1980s. Worse yet,
sporting goods manufacturers and retailers expect annual
growth to average just 2% to 3% over the next 10 to 20 years,
a recent survey by consultants Kurt Salmon Associates found.
   "The market isn't growing," says Scott Reda, a distributor
in Easton, Pa. "We're just fighting for the same customers."
   The industry depends increasingly on fashion whims.
Booming sales of apparel with team logos and trendy soccer
wear will prop up the industry's growth this year, says John
Horan, editor of the trade newsletter Sporting Goods
Intelligence.
   Other merchandise won't fare as well. The recession and
worries about unemployment have hurt leisure spending. New
hightech products, such as a $125 superlight baseball bat,
are often too costly to sell well in hard times. Sales of
sports equipment are flat, Mr. Horan says. And growth in
sales of athletic shoes has slowed to 4%, he says, from 20%
in the '80s.
   Tighter leisure budgets and increased emphasis on family
may shift some business toward less expensive sports, even
after the recession lifts. Alvin Lubetkin, president and
chief executive of Oshman's Sporting Goods, a chain based in
Houston, expects sales of camping equipment and backyard
games such as badminton and volleyball to rise at least 10%
annually. "We'll see a rethinking of how people spend their
leisure time," he says.
                                                                                                       

   For Olympics Tie-Ins,
   Industry Looks to '96
                                                                                                       

   THE BIGGEST sports event of 1992 -- the Olympics -- isn't
sparking the interest of sporting goods manufacturers.
   Sales of equipment for sports that are rarely televised
outside the Olympics, such as volleyball, may benefit
slightly from the games, analysts say. But overall, the
industry isn't paying much attention. The Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association expects only a modest gain in sales
around the Olympics, says president John Riddle.
   Given the right conditions, the Olympics can be a boon.
Mr. Reda expects industry sales to rise 25% when Atlanta
plays host to the 1996 Summer Games.
   But this year's Winter and Summer games are both in
Europe. And they come at a particularly tough time. As the
recession hurts business, retailers are cutting back
inventory and manufacturers slowing production. Orders for
this spring are down about 20%, Mr. Reda says.
                                                                                                       

   Soccer Garb, Shoes
   Gain a Foothold
                                                                                                       

   SOCCER may still be a poor cousin to football and basket
ball, but the soccer look is holding its own off the field.
   Soccer fashion "is big business," says Oshman's Mr.
Lubetkin. "Maybe 10% of the customers go to the field. Most
wear it because it looks good."
   There's a burgeoning market for baggy soccer shorts,
soccer shoes and post-game sandals. Industry analysts say the
soccer apparel and shoe market totals $425 million to $620
million and is growing 10% a year. It should get a big boost
when the 1994 World Cup is held in the U.S.
   Soccer is the nation's fastest-growing sport, according to
a survey of retailers and manufacturers by Kurt Salmon
Associates. High school soccer participation has nearly
doubled in the past decade, as other team sports have seen a
decline, says John Briggs Jr., executive director of the
Soccer Industry Council of America.
   Moreover, the demographics of soccer appeal to marketers.
It has broader participant appeal than other big team sports:
One-third of soccer players are female. Also, "it's played
more by the daughters and sons of professionals in the
suburbs," says Ian McLaren, president of Umbro USA, the
nation's biggest maker of soccer equipment.
   Umbro's sales more than doubled in 1991. People buy soccer
shorts for "lounging in their house," swimming, weightlifting
and sleeping, Mr. McLaren says.
   Black leather soccer shoes (without cleats, made for
artificial turf) are also doing well. People wear the shoes
"seven days a week," says Peter Moore, president of Patrick
USA, a manufacturer, whose overall sales grew 22% last year.
Its sales of rubber soccer sandals -- more expensive versions
of flip-flops, with an Italian design and massaging cones
that soccer players covet to soothe their soles -- have
doubled in the past two years, he says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE SUPER Show's 200 new products include a few zingers.
The Flytrap Fielders Glove, priced at $80, comes with a
sticky palm, the better to snare screaming liners with.
Newman Tackified Glove, in Hoboken, N.J., says it soaks the
palm in a "petrochemical" mixture. . . . One product might
wipe out the post-workout shower. Misty Mate, in Chandler,
Ariz., makes a $39 portable air conditioner that straps to
the waist. The two-pound device runs only on pressurized
water -- no batteries or electricity -- and sprays mist or
cool air for up to two hours between fillings. It was
invented to help construction workers stay on the job in hot
weather.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
Put Him in the Hall, Specs and All
---
By Frederick C. Klein</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The calendar and Midwestern weather say it's February, but with pitchers and catchers assembling for spring training in the sunny climes, it's hard to keep one's thoughts from baseball. 
Two sounds penetrate: the traditional crack of bat against ball (aaah!), and the crunch of the free-agent players' collision with collusion. 

   It is undisputable that freedom should be indivisible. 
It also is indisputable that the team owners have put their heads together on salaries, although they will dispute it. 
At the same time, though, it's hard to work up much sympathy for the players for the simple reason that being richer has not, as a rule, made them nicer. 

   I recall being in the Detroit Tigers' clubhouse after a night game during the team's 1984 championship season. 
Reporters were interviewing a Tiger whose locker was near that of pitcher Jack Morris. 
Morris had his radio on so loud that it was difficult to hear what the other player was saying. 
Someone asked him, politely, to turn it down. 
He turned it up instead. 
This is the same Mr. Morris who, having failed to peddle his talents elsewhere, just won an arbitrator's salary award of $1.85 million for staying in Detroit this season. 

   So for my 1987 baseball commencement column, I will address a happier subject: the question of whether Dominic DiMaggio, the old Boston Red Sox outfielder, belongs in baseball's Hall of Fame. 
The fellow who raises this question is Dick Flavin, a Boston television commentator and speaker-for-all-occasions. 
Not surprisingly, his answer is an emphatic "yes." 

   The "most-underrated" label is the most overworked in sports, but Mr. Flavin does not blush to apply it to DiMaggio, the youngest of the three baseball-playing brothers. 
"He was a wonderful player in every aspect of the game," Mr. Flavin declares. 
"It was only because he played next to one baseball legend -- Ted Williams -- and was the brother of another -- Joe -- that he didn't get the recognition he deserved." 

   Mr. Flavin opines that Dom DiMaggio should be in the Hall if for no other reason than that he wore eyeglasses throughout his Major League career. 
He believes that as the putative National Pastime, baseball has a duty to provide heroes for all groups in our population, and that eyeglass wearers, a sizable bunch, have been sadly neglected. 

   I can only agree. 
An inquiry to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., about glasses-wearers among the 161 players enshrined there reveals that only one -- Chick Hafey of the St. Louis Cardinals -- regularly wore specs on the field. 
That is intolerable. 

   Another reason to elevate DiMaggio is that he was a rare athlete who walked away from a pro career instead of being carted out. 
In 1952, his last full season in the Bigs, he batted .294 in 128 games. 
In the spring of 1953, at age 36, he suffered an eye injury, but by opening day reported ready to play. 

   Red Sox manager Lou Boudreau elected to field a younger man. 
After a month on the bench DiMaggio called it quits, surrendering his then-princely annual salary of $40,000. 
"Some guys said they wouldn't have just sat on the bench for $40,000, they'd have sat under it," says the 70-year-old DiMaggio from his winter home in Del Ray Beach, Fla. 
"But I didn't want to hang around if I couldn't play regularly." 

   DiMaggio, of course, has more conventional credentials for Hall membership. 
His effective career spanned 10 seasons over the 13 years from 1940 through 1952, with a three-year break (1943-45) for World War II military service. 
His lifetime batting average of .294 is better than that of 23 non-pitchers in the Cooperstown museum. 

   He averaged 168 hits a year and 62 runs batted in, OK for someone who usually batted leadoff and stood just 5 feet 9. 
More noteworthy are his 1,046 career runs scored. 
Only two Hall of Famers from the modern era -- Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio -- scored better than 100 runs a year. 

   Dom DiMaggio also excelled in a part of baseball often overlooked by the granters of immortality: fielding. 
Twice he led the American League centerfielders in putouts and three times in assists. 

   Bill Deane, a researcher at the Hall of Fame, in his spare time compared the fielding marks of the top centerfielders in baseball between 1935 and 1950, and concluded that Dom was, arguably, the best of his era. 
"Joe got the most credit, but you can make a case that he was the third-best fielder in his family, behind both Dom and Vince," says Mr. Deane, who emphasizes that's his opinion, not the Hall's. 

   Dom came within a step of being the hero of the 1946 World Series between Boston and St. Louis, the only one in which he played. 
The step came as he rounded first base on a double that drove in two runs and tied the seventh game of the series, 33, in the eighth inning. 
It pulled his hamstring muscle and forced him to leave the contest, which placed his sub, Leon Culberson, in centerfield when Enos Slaughter scored the winning run from first base on Harry Walker's single to that field in the bottom of the frame. 

   "I like to think I'd have thrown out Slaughter on that play . . . if he'd had the courage to run on me at all," DiMaggio says. 

   It is irrelevant to his baseball record, but nonetheless interesting, that DiMaggio prospered mightily after he left the game. 
One company he headed, Delaware Valley Corp., makes auto carpeting, and another, Dom DiMaggio Inc., makes foam-rubber products. 
They did well enough to allow him to own a piece of the football Boston Patriots in the 1960s, and to join a group that made a bid to buy the Red Sox a few years ago. 
Both firms are run by his sons while he splits his retirement days between Florida and Cape Cod. 

   DiMaggio never received more than 43 votes of the 270 or so he needed in any year he was eligible for election to the Hall by sportswriters. 
That makes him a long shot to be picked by the Veterans' Committee, which considers players long retired. 

   It's a situation he views philosophically. 
"If I make it, fine, and if I don't, fine, too," he says. 
"The fun was in the playing. 
Anything else would be extra."

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Game to Be Savored</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Ernest Thayer's famous poem, ``Casey at the
Bat,'' to James Thurber's short story, ``You Could Look It Up,''
baseball has been literature's favorite sport.
   That tradition continues with Roger Angell's ``Season Ticket''
(Houghton Mifflin Co., 18.95), the fourth book the fiction editor
at the New Yorker magazine has written about the summer game.
   Although he writes about drugs and strikes, temperamental owners
and million-dollar salaries, Angell believes the real story is
still on the playing field. And he approvingly cites the saying of
the late Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck that baseball is a game
to savor.
   ``This insatiable thirst by the fans for what someone is really
like is OK,'' Angell said, ``but I think they sort of miss the
point for why they're there in the first place.''
   Angell has been writing about baseball since 1962. Each year, he
visits the spring training camps in Florida and Arizona, travels to
ballparks around the country during the regular season and attends
as many post-season games as possible. He is not just interested in
the games themselves but how they are played.
   ``The past few years I've been asking how they catch, how they
pitch,'' he said in an interview. ``The players, once they know
you're interested in what they're doing, you can't shut them up.''
   ``Season Ticket'' compiles articles starting with the 1983
season through the summer of 1987, when Angell describes a visit to
baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Whether writing about
the 1986 World Series or discussing the intricacies of how catchers
field their position, Angell is continually surprised at how much
there is to learn about baseball.
   ``I'm just beginning to understand. We all go through this. It's
very easy for fans to think that they know the game,'' he said.
``Listen to (New York Mets announcer) Tim McCarver. This is a guy
who's been playing the game all his life and everytime I listen I
learn something new.''
   In the preface of ``Season Ticket,'' Angell writes that baseball
is a game that can never be fully understood:
   ``I will always be an amateur of baseball, but I no longer feel
like an outsider; none of the old pros I talked to ... gave me the
impression that he had subdued the game, either. We are baffled but
still learning, and we keep coming back for more.''
   Angell was born in 1920. His mother, Katherine, was an editor at
the New Yorker for many years. His stepfather was E.B. White.
   ``He (White) suffered writing but made it look easy,'' Angell
said. ``He taught me how difficult it is to write.''
   Although he admires the spare, clean prose that was White's
trademark, Angell changes his style when writing about baseball.
   ``I think that I've developed a habit of rather long sentences
with parentheses which I don't use in other writing,'' he said.
``You use run-on sentences like the flavor of the run-on feeling in
the ballgame.''
   Angell believes the pace of a baseball game makes it easier to
write about. ``Baseball is linear. One thing happens, then
something else happens,'' he said. ``You can take notes. You can go
back and recreate a game and you can almost always explain why
something happened.
   ``You can't do that with basketball or hockey _ they move too
fast.''
   As someone who became a fan when Babe Ruth was in his prime,
Angell has seen many changes: night games, artificial turf, the
designated hitter. He has lost none of his enthusiasm.
   ``The game itself has hardly changed at all in our lifetime. The
leagues are bigger, the players are better paid but it has the same
feel. It's a real part of summer.''
   Like many fans, Angell has imagined himself playing in the major
leagues. He was a pitcher in high school and use to dream about
striking out the side. He remembers when his fantasy stopped.
   ``At some point in my upper 30s or early 40s, I was seeing a
psychiatrist and I came in with a dream,'' Angell recalled. ``I
dreamed that there were some bushes and shrubbery and there was a
gravestone with my name and my birthday on it and the year I was in.
   ``I took this dream to my shrink with some trepidation and he
asked how I felt and I said I felt sort of sad. He asked me what
the gravestone reminded me of and I said it reminds of those stones
out in center field in Yankee Stadium.
   ``Then I realized it meant the end of my baseball dreams.''
   In a chapter discussing the drug problems that have tarnished
baseball's image in recent years, Angell warns against expecting
too much of the players:
   ``I think a great many of us have begun to see how deeply we
want baseball players and other athletes to be better than we are.
We may wish this now more than ever before, because other heroes _
in politics, in our daily lives _ seem to be in short supply.''
   Angell never worries about expecting too much from the game
itself.
   ``The enthusiasm I have for baseball is real,'' he said. ``My
appreciation has increased with the knowledge. I've noticed a lot
of players feel this way too.''

MORNING BRIEFING: BO'S HOMER DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson hit a tape-measure home run off Nolan Ryan in Arlington, Tex., 
Tuesday night, but he has a lot of distance to cover before he catches up with 
Mickey Mantle, according to the man who virtually invented the term 
"tape-measure homer." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur E. (Red) Patterson was the New York Yankees' publicity man in 1953, when 
Mantle hit what many still believe to be baseball's longest home run. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson went outside Griffith Stadium that night, April 17, 1953, stepped off 
the distance of a majestic Mantle home run and came up with a figure of 565 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
When he worked for the Yankees, Patterson said he saw Mantle hit "about a 
dozen" home runs in the 450- to 500-foot class. But the Washington blast, he 
says, outdistanced them all. 
</P>
<P>
Add Mantle: The homer seems to get a little longer every time Patterson tells 
the story. When contacted Wednesday, Patterson, now 80, described it again. 
</P>
<P>
Mantle, batting right-handed against left-hander Chuck Stobbs, hit a drive that 
was helped by a wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball not only cleared the left-field bleachers, but went out of the park 
about halfway up the scoreboard, which was on top of the bleachers," recalled 
Patterson, now a special consultant for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still going up when it went out. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a kid with the ball, and he told me the ball came down 'In a lady's 
back yard.' He showed me the spot and I stepped it off -- I never really used a 
tape measure -- to the outfield fence. Then I added the home-to-fence distance 
inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave the kid $10 for the ball, got Mantle's bat, and convinced the Yankees 
to put them on display in the Yankee Stadium lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We did, and someone stole them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our radio announcer, Mel Allen, made pleas every day for them to be returned, 
that no questions would be asked. Some kid returned them. He told us he took 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The (New York) writers accused me of fabricating the whole thing, but it's a 
true story. The bat and ball are in the Hall of Fame today." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jackson's homer traveled 461 feet, according to the IBM tape 
measure chip in Arlington Stadium's scoreboard. According to Kansas City 
writers, it was Jackson's second-longest homer. He hit a 475-footer in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For Added Measure: Only one player, Willie Stargell, ever hit a fair ball out 
of Dodger Stadium, and he did it twice. The first was a 506-foot 6-inch blast 
off Alan Foster in 1969; the second a 470-footer off Andy Messersmith in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Stargell's 1969 homer cleared the outfield pavilion roof on the fly. The 1973 
shot hit the roof, then bounced out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Only four players, according to the Dodgers, ever reached the loge level 
(second level) with home runs: Frank Howard, Dave Kingman (twice), Dave Parker 
and Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
For Short Measure: There can be no discussion of tape-measure homers without 
mention of Frank Howard's rocket launched at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in 
1960. Someone stepped that one off at 565 feet, too. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Babe Ruth was credited for a spring training homer in Tampa, Fla., 
that traveled anywhere from 560 to 656 feet, depending on who was telling the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Another epic Mantle home run occurred at Yankee Stadium in 1963. Batting 
left-handed against Kansas City's Bill Fischer, Mantle hit a ball that struck 
the upper-deck facade, 18 inches below the roof. It was one of two homers 
Mantle hit off the facade. 
</P>
<P>
There is no record of anyone hitting a fair ball out of Yankee Stadium, but 
there are stories of Josh Gibson accomplishing the feat in a Negro League game. 
</P>
<P>
For Final Measure: Steve Gietschier, archivist at the Sporting News, says he's 
never seen a list of baseball's longest homers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a thick file labeled 'tape-measure homers,' but it's just old 
clippings," he said. "From looking at it, I'd say every well-known home run 
hitter in the game has hit at least one." 
</P>
<P>
Dept. of Brains and Spikes: One of the entries in the women's mile at the Aug. 
6 Jack-in-the-Box Invitational track meet at UCLA is Kathy Kanes, who recently 
received her doctorate in chemistry at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Caltech? 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably on the top-50 list of U.S. women milers," meet director Al 
Franken said. "She's never going to beat Mary Slaney. But then, Mary Slaney 
never explained room temperature fusion to me, either." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: "I enjoy physical contact," said Dennis Byrd, 270-pound defensive 
lineman from Tulsa and a New York Jet draft pick. "I really like to hit. This 
is the only sport except boxing where you can abuse someone and not go to jail 
for it."

<LEADPARA>  BOBBY THOMSON will turn 68 on Oct. 25, and you'd think by now he would be
retired not only from baseball but from the real world. You'd expect him to be
reaping everything one might expect from an individual who produced what Roger
Angell has called "the most vivid single moment, the grand exclamation point,
in the history of the pastime," or what the late Red Smith tried to describe
as "the inexpressibly fantastic.";   He's not. "I live a very normal working
man's life here," Thomson said by phone recently from his home in Watchung,
N.J. "I've been working ever since I got out of baseball."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A PLACE IN HISTORY
FORTY YEARS LATER, THAT'S THOMSON'S ONLY REWARD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Thomson handles East Coast sales for a Chicago-based container company,
working in the browncraft segment and dealing in grocery sacks and corrugated
boxes.;   Maybe it's the price you pay for baseball immortality, but it
doesn't seem right. He should be forever young, still dancing around the bases
and diving into a tide of teammates, or at the very least removed from
commonality.;   He doesn't complain, not even with so much justification.
Today's player can parlay the smallest achievement into a fortune. Do today
what Thomson did in 1951, and you're set for quite a few lifetimes.;  
"There's nothing to be happy or unhappy about -- what the hell, it's there for
them, so why not get it?" Thomson said. . . . It's not like when we played,
when you signed a one-year contract and got paid for what you did the year
before. These guys are getting paid money that they haven't even earned yet.
It's not good business.";   Trying not to sound like an old-school cliche, he
paused and said, "It's not for me to judge, but it probably would have been a
little different for me if I had done that today.";   What Thomson did was hit
the most dramatic home run in baseball history, the "Shot Heard 'Round The
World." It came off Ralph Branca on Oct. 3, 1951, in the bottom of the ninth
inning of the third and final playoff game, beating the loathed Brooklyn
Dodgers 5-4 and completing the New York Giants' comeback from 13 1/2 games out
on Aug. 11 to the National League pennant.;   What Thomson did was write the
gist of his own epitaph with one swing of the bat. The current Giants
management phoned him a while back, when the team was making a stirring
comeback from 15 games out to within six of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The club
wanted to know about his schedule, with the possibility that there would be a
Bobby Thomson Day on Oct. 3. Although the Giants and the promotion idea faded
away, Thomson said, "It's nice this thing is still kicking around. It's nice
to be remembered.";   Vivid memory; Ernie Harwell remembers it like yesterday.
He and Russ Hodges were Giants broadcasters then, one on radio and one on
television, which had just gone coast-to-coast. On this day, it was Harwell's
turn to be in the TV booth for the first and last three innings.;   They made
the switch after the sixth, when the Dodgers were milking a 1-0 lead and the
crowd at the Polo Grounds was growing restless. Thomson tied the score in the
seventh with a sacrifice fly, but the Dodgers scored three in the eighth and
still had starting pitcher Don Newcombe on the mound.;   The Giants cut it to
4-2 in the bottom of the ninth on two seeing-eye grounders and an RBI double
by Whitey Lockman. The Giants and many others thought Newk still had it, and
Dodgers Manager Charley Dressen wasn't sure. Acting on players' advice at a
mound meeting, he called for Branca.;   Branca's plan; Branca had given up a
homer to Thomson that decided Game 1, and he wanted to get ahead in the count
this time. He succeeded by throwing a fastball for a called strike. The plan
was to come back with a fastball up and in, where Thomson supposedly was
vulnerable, and then Branca would be able to waste a third pitch for a
breaking ball low and away. That was the plan.;   Thomson swung at the second
pitch, and crack: Every eye followed the ball's flight to left field. It
sailed over Andy Pafko's head and into the seats. Thomson pranced around the
bases and leaped into awaiting arms at the plate.;   Two different views;
"It's gone," was all that Harwell said, letting the TV picture tell the story.
He adds today: "I had a little misgiving -- 'Am I calling it too early?' But
it made it over the wall, and I just stayed quiet for a while, let the crowd
noise take over, and then, after what seemed two or three minutes -- actually
30 or 40 seconds, they swung the camera around on me and I did a little recap.
Our TV setup was not as refined as it is now.";   In the booth next door,
Hodges was going wild: "Bobby Thomson up there swinging. . . . Brooklyn leads
it 4-2. . . . Branca throws. . . . There's a long drive. . . . It's gonna be.
. . . I believe. . . . The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! . . . Bobby Thomson
hits into the lower deck of the left-field stands and they're going crazy!
Yaaaaho-o-o-o-o!";   The aftermath; Branca was found later on the steps
leading from the Dodgers' clubhouse to the trainer's room, lying on his
stomach, weeping and muttering pitifully, "Why me? Why me?";   Thomson was on
a cloud for the longest time, and it carried him that night onto the Perry
Como Show.;   The Giants went on to lose the World Series to the Yankees;
Thomson went on to a decent career and a longer one in sales; and Branca never
got that pitch back but did develop a lasting friendship with his rival. The
two sign baseballs together, their paths inextricably interwoven.;   "Now it
is done," Red Smith wrote. "Now the story ends. And there is no way to tell
it. The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangled invention. Only the
utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible
again."; BIG SHOTS;   (box) THE SHOT HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLD (Oct. 3, 1951):
Bobby Thomson hit a high-and-tight fastball from Brooklyn reliever Ralph
Branca over the left-field wall for a three-run homer, giving the Giants a 5-4
ninth-inning victory and a pennant in the deciding game of a three-game
playoff.;   (box) MAZ'S MIRACLE (Oct. 13, 1960): The New York Yankees scored
two runs in the top of the ninth inning to tie the score at 9-9 in Game 7 of
the World Series, but Pittsburgh's Bill Mazeroski hit the winning homer off
Yankees reliever Ralph Terry.;   (box) MARIS' 61ST (Oct. 1, 1961): Roger Maris
had one game left to break the hallowed single-season record of Babe Ruth, and
he sent a waist-high fastball from Boston's Tracy Stallard 15 rows deep to
right field at Yankee Stadium.;   (box) HOMER IN THE GLOAMIN' (Sept. 28,
1938): The Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates were tied for the N.L. lead and
they were tied 5-5 going into the bottom of the ninth on the final day of the
season. If no one scored in that half, it would be declared a draw. With two
out in semi-darkness at Wrigley Field, Gabby Hartnett, the Cubs' catcher and
manager, hit the pennant-winning homer.;   (box) CARLTON FISK'S FAIR BALL
(Oct. 21, 1975): Boston's Bernie Carbo tied Game 6 of the World Series with a
three-run pinch-homer in the eighth inning, and it remained 6-6 going into the
bottom of the 12th. Carlton Fisk swung at the second pitch from Cincinnati
reliever Pat Darcy and hit it toward the left-field foul pole. He applied body
English as the ball went just fair, and he danced around the basepaths.;  
(box) BABE RUTH'S 'CALLED' HOMER (Oct. 1, 1932): Ruth hit 15 homers in 10
World Series, and his last one was by far the most famous. Or at least, the
most controversial. In the fifth inning of Game 3 at Wrigley, Cubs
right-hander Charlie Root threw a called strike to Ruth, and the batter held
up one finger in accordance with the call. Two balls later, there was another
called strike and another such gesture by Ruth. It appeared to some people
that Ruth then pointed to the center-field bleachers, and on the next pitch he
hit one to the very spot, the longest homer anyone had hit there.; -- Mercury

   What is a Christmas display without a laser
light show anyway?.
   Striving to outdo himself, Al Copeland, the owner of Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken, has added the light show and artifical snow to
his gaudy annual holiday display _ the one the Louisiana Supreme
Court forced him to move away from his home in suburban New Orleans.
   Now at his corporate headquarters near a New Orleans shopping
center, the display featuring more than a million lights was to be
lit up for the first time this season Friday.
   Copeland started his Christmas displays outside his suburban
mansion in the early 1980s, but they grew to the point that
thousands of people would jam the streets to gawk at the lights and
giant figures of reindeer, Santa Claus, a snowman and angels.
   Unhappy neighbors went to court and, in 1985, the state Supreme
Court ordered the display turned off and dismantled. Copeland moved
the show to his corporate offices two years ago.

   The ``binocap'' and shoestring holders
beat out the doggie doorbell and flavored clarinet reeds in a
5th-grade battle of inventors.
   Jeremy John Alberhasky said he hated holding binoculars during a
football game so he invented the binocap, combination headwear and
binoculars, by gluing snap-out pocket binoculars to a baseball cap.
   The 11-year-old was one of the winners at Regina Elementary
School's invention contest.
   Katie Drop, 10, also was a winner with shoelace holders made out
of Velcro fasteners.
   ``Shoelaces always come undone and you trip on them,'' she said.
``I put Velcro on so they stay up.''
   Everyday problems were on the minds of most of the young
inventors.
   Tired of awful-tasting clarinet reeds, Lucy LePeau, 11, dipped
some in peppermint and orange extract.
   Katie Lacina, 10, invented a doggie doorbell so she would not
have to constantly check to see if her dog wanted to come inside.
She tied a spring, bell and bone to a piece of string so her dog
could announce its arrival by pulling on the bone.

THE ART OF THE GAME

WHEN PETER H. GORDON of the New York State Museum began putting together an 
exhibition of baseball-themed art, he discovered it was a massive task. With 
its thrilling heroics and mesmerizing rhythms, the national pastime has 
captured the imaginations of American artists and writers in a way that, say, 
badminton or even soccer never could. What is it about baseball that makes us 
cherish it so? Curator Gordon has come up with 149 individual answers in 
"Diamonds Are Forever: Artists and Writers on Baseball," up from Aug. 19 
through Oct. 21 at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 700 Prospect St. in La Jolla. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday through Sunday and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday. Admission is $4 for 
adults, $2 for students and senior citizens, 50 cents for children 5 to 12; 
children under 5 free. Admission is free from 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesday. For more 
information, telephone the museum at (619) 454-3541. The exhibition is 
sponsored by the American Express Company.

It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in 
the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, 
filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, 
it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. A. Bartlett Giamatti. "The 
Green Fields of the Mind"

"I loved the game," Shoeless Joe went on. "I'd have played for food money. I'd 
have played free and worked for food. It was the game, the parks, the smells, 
the sounds. Have you ever held a bat or a baseball to your face? The varnish, 
the leather." W. P. Kinsella. "Shoeless Joe"

Things as critical as this, the selection of a favored baseball team, are not, 
as some suspect, a matter of choice; one does not choose a team as one does not 
select his own genes. They are confirmed upon you, more than we know an act of 
heredity. David Halberstam ."The Fan Divided"

Custom-Made Audio Tapes
Put Fans in Hero Roles;
Laxalt Wins Wimbledon

   Did you hear about the time President Reagan played shortstop for the Chicago Cubs in a game with the New York Yankees and knocked the ball out of the park in the ninth inning to win the game? 

   Ronald Reagan heard all about it -- on an audio tape presented to him in 1985 by his friend Paul Laxalt, then a senator from Nevada. 

   The tape, a get-well gift, was created by Nat Albright, the proprietor of Fantasy Tapes in Arlington, Va. 
Using recorded sounds such as roaring crowds and cracks of the bat, Mr. Albright did the play-by-play from a script he wrote. 
The resulting cassette sounds like a radio broadcast of an authentic sporting event. 

   Mr. Laxalt ordered the gift for the president after his staff gave him a tape in which he defeated John McEnroe to win the Wimbledon tennis championship. 
That heady experience was also created by Mr. Albright, who explains the appeal a fantasy-sports tape has for presidents, senators and the not-so-celebrated. 
"It allows you to be the star," he says. 

   He adds: "For those who dreamed about playing at the Masters, driving a car in the Indy 500 or playing center court at Wimbledon, they can live the dream with a fantasy-sports tape." 

   Another Washington-area company, Hall of Fame Tapes Inc. of Bethesda, Md., reports brisk demand for similar tapes from business people and others. 
David Landau, a recruiter for a Washington law firm, and Richard Stark, a Roy Rogers franchise manager, started making the tapes out of their love of sports and, Mr. Landau says, because they saw a "tremendous market opportunity" for the items. 
The tapes are sold at prices that range between $50 and $70, depending on how many "stars" are featured on the tape and other extras. 

   Mr. Albright, who began professional sports announcing for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1948 and later announced for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, has been creating sports-fantasy tapes since 1982. 
Since then, he has produced tapes for notables such as former House Speaker Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, cartoonist Gary Trudeau and director-actor Ron Howard. 

   "Trudeau's sister ordered a tape for him. 
He played quarterback for the {Washington} Redskins. 
Tip O'Neill played baseball with the Boston Red Sox. 
Ron Howard played second base for the Los Angeles Dodgers {and} flew all the way out here from California to pick the tape up," Mr. Albright says. 

   Mr. Albright has made "about three or four thousand" tapes since 1982, he says, inventing fictitious horse races, boxing matches and basketball games. 
He has an engineering sound room that can produce noises like a revving race-car engine, a shot-clock buzzer at a basketball game and a crowd's oohs and ahs. 

   Hall of Fame specializes in tapes for companies and corporations to kick off conferences, board meetings and sales presentations. 
"In those specialty sports tapes, we man an entire team with company personnel and typically feature the CEO scoring the game-winning basket or hitting the dramatic ninth-inning home run," says Mr. Landau. 
Some of these companies have included Union Carbide Corp. and General Electric Co. 

   Mr. Landau and Mr. Stark got the idea for the tapes from the high prices that fans were paying to play at camps with retired baseball stars. 
The partners, who have been friends since the first grade, handle the business end of the operation and do some creative scriptwriting, but most of the play-by-play is left to Robert Workman, a professional announcer. 

   A Hall of Fame tape made for Robert Abney, a pediatrician from Jackson, Miss., playing a chip shot in the Masters golf tournament went like this: 

   "The chip is away. . . . 
It looks right on target. . . . 
It has a chance. . . . 
Yes! . . . 
It's in the cup. . . . 
I don't believe it! . . . 
Bob Abney sinks a 30-foot chip shot . . . and is the 1987 Masters champion. . . . 
An amateur, born July 24, 1938, {he} walks over to accept congratulations from a stunned Larry Mize. . . . 
Mize must be very disappointed, but today belongs to Dr. Abney, winner of the green jacket by one stroke over a real pro." 

   In another Hall of Fame tape, Pierre Salinger of ABC News substituted for superstar quarterback Dan Fouts in a fictitious pro-football title game won by the San Diego Chargers. 
The tape was a gift to Mr. Salinger from his son, Steven. 

   "He freaked out," the younger Mr. Salinger says. 
"He is a big Chargers fan. 
He used to own part of the team. 
I'm a big Raiders fan, and that's the team the Chargers played. 
Fouts was injured, and Dad stepped in to throw a last-minute touchdown, recovered the on-side kick and on a halfback option, ran the ball in for another touchdown." 

   Howard Schllosberg, a New York retailing executive, has done a great deal for the fantasy-tapes industry. 
"I've purchased over 100 tapes. 
I ordered a lot of them around Christmas," says Mr. Schllosberg. 

   Most of Mr. Schllosberg's friends who receive tapes want to give other tapes as gifts to their friends. 
"I've had about 20 people who wanted to order tapes," he says. 
One of the orders was destined as a gift for Ivan Lendl and his manager; it featured the tennis star losing to the manager. 

   Creative taping has turned David Hartman, former "Good Morning America" co-host, into the heavyweight champion of the world and has allowed William Leonard, former president of CBS News, to lead the Redskins to Super Bowl glory. 
In another memorable audio fantasy, the chairman of I. Magnin Department Stores hit a homer in the ninth to win the World Series for the New York Yankees. 

   Harvey Freeman, a New York attorney for the Trump organization, received as a gift a tape on which he teamed up with Willis Reed and Walt Frazier to lead the New York Knicks to the 1970 National Basketball Association championship over the Los Angeles Lakers. 

   "It was a fulfillment of a fantasy I have had for a while," Mr. Freeman says. 
"It was a delightful gift for someone who has only played basketball on the playgrounds as a child."

<DESCRIPT>  SPORT; CHAMPIONSHIP; END; CUBA; ANALYSIS; OPINION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  SUNDAY was the last day of the Pan American Games, but it was like every other
day here. Cuba won more gold medals. The Cuban national anthem was played 11
times at boxing alone. Fidel Castro watched from a box seat, did the wave,
then spoke briefly at the closing ceremonies.;   "Thanks to the extraordinary
efforts of our people," said Castro emotionally, "we have been able to
discharge with honor our pledge."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NO RATIONING CUBANS' JOY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     That pledge -- made in January -- was to finish the Pan Am stadiums on
time, then stage the games without any palpitaciones. In other words, no
screw-ups.;   Remarkably, it happened. The stadiums were fine. The security
was fine. No U.S. athlete was disqualified for drugs or was arrested by the
local policia. That's one reason the games played so poorly in Peoria, where
"Bowling for Soybeans" probably drew higher ratings than the Pan Am swim
finals. From the U.S. angle, the games were boring.;   But the Cuban angle --
here, on the scene -- was quite different. These past two weeks were a daily
whiff of sweet air in a polluted city. We saw athletes weeping for joy and
spectators literally sprinting from city buses to get inside to see events.;  
SUNDAY at the boxing arena, when it was announced that Cuba had clinched the
most Pan Am gold medals (140-130 over the United States, which sent mostly
second-string athletes), the place went to pieces. Grown men wept.;   And all
you could think was: good for them. The citizens of every country -- not the
politicians, the average citizens -- deserve a feel-good victory lap once in a
while. The United States had one in 1984 at Los Angeles and reacted no less
giddily than Cuba did Sunday.;   Look, these people had to give up their food
rations this summer so that athletes could eat as well as possible at the Pan
Am Village. What do you want them to do? Restrain themselves? There will be
time enough for that. Those food ration books are part of the Pan Am economic
hangover that will begin here today.;   Oddly, the official line is these
tough times are good for the country, because they will only make Cuba
stronger. Huh? I've discovered so many odd twists to this country that before
I leave I should make a list of them. In fact, I should make two lists.;  
THREE very strange things I found in Cuba:;   1. Dollars. U.S. dollars.
Everywhere. This is the absolute nuttiest part about Cuba. The country has no
diplomatic relationship with the United States, but all the hotels and tourist
restaurants take only dollars. Castro needs them to prop up his murky economy.
So when tourists from Germany or France come here, they must change their
marks or francs into dollars before spending any money.;   2. Expensive
restaurants. Another effect of the grab for dollars. A full dinner at the
Floridita, where the daiquiri was invented and Ernest Hemingway once hung out,
costs around $50. At the famed Tropicana nightclub, the cover charge alone is
$45, with food extra.;   3. Fans of U.S. sports stars. Even though few games
are shown here, Cubans have a fair knowledge of U.S. baseball players. "You've
met Rickey Henderson?" they ask. "Canseco wears No. 33, right?";   Three
strange things I did not find in Cuba:;   1. Cubans in the tourist hotels and
restaurants. Because the government is aggressively pursuing tourism, it
doesn't want ordinary citizens bothering the new visitors. This means Cuban
civilians cannot enter the best eateries and nightclubs in their own towns.
Cubans supposedly accept this practice, understanding its economic benefits.
Sure. Most Cubans I met called it "tourist apartheid.";   2. Souvenir
baseballs. The custom here is for all foul balls to be returned from the
stands. Fans hoot and whistle until the fan who catches the ball throws it
back onto the field. Wait till they hear what an autographed game ball is
worth at memorabilia shows in the United States.;   3. Nutrasweet. Cuba's top
cash crop is sugar, so there are no diet soft drinks to be found anywhere. The
most popular refreshment -- for the fans who can afford it -- is called
Tropi-Cola. It has extra sugar, extra caffeine and has already rotted away
three of my teeth.;   But back to the good news. With the United States' blah
performance here, there will probably be cries for the United States to
abandon the Pan Am Games entirely to Latin American nations. Big mistake. You
can ask Jeffrey Hammonds why.;   Hammonds, the Stanford baseball player who
started in center field for the U.S. team, said his greatest pleasure here was
exploring Havana.;   "Kids will come up to me on the street here," said
Hammonds, "and they will yell, 'Jeffreehammons! Jeffreehammons!' " he said.
"They recognize me from the games on television. They want to shake my hand.";
  For children whose vision of people in the United States is fashioned by all
the anti-imperialist propaganda and rabble-rousing billboards along the
roadways ("UNCLE SAM, WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOU"), that is no small advance in
international relations. We'd be wise to remember that the next time we think
the Pan Am Games are a waste. In Havana, you'd get an argument about that.  </TEXT>

SCOTT OSTLER: NEGATIVE OUTLOOK IS PERFECT -- UNLESS YOU'RE DODGER FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Mr. Negative . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What's with that twinge in Orel Hershiser's right arm, Mr. Negative? It hit 
him his last two starts. He and the team doctors play it down, but give it to 
us straight -- is this anything to worry about? 
</P>
<P>
 Only if you're a Dodger fan. We're not talking about a twinge in Tom Lasorda's 
arm, are we? Or Fred Claire's. 
</P>
<P>
Twinges can be tricky. San Francisco once was destroyed by a twinge in the San 
Andreas Fault. If you're halfway to Hawaii and the pilot of your 747 announces 
that a slight twinge has been detected in the cargo door, do you go right back 
to sleep, or do you ring your flight-attendant call button and ask for a 
parachute? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this twinge is something Orel can work out by playing Ping-Pong, but 
maybe it's something that will eventually require a delicate and risky 
twingeotomy. 
</P>
<P>
As the old saying goes, baseball is a game of twinges. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry is angry with his Met teammates because they're devoting too 
much time to playing cards and golf. He says, "We don't get paid to play cards 
and golf." Your reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 Those players have lousy agents. Most baseball players do get paid to play 
cards and golf. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I can't understand why Darryl is taking such a strong stand against 
baseball tradition. Cards and golf have been popular with ballplayers since 
baseball was invented. Managers insist only that players refrain from cards and 
golf while the baseball game is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
The last ballplayer who said he was going to give up cards and golf and find 
something better to do with his time was Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with parking-lot attendants these days? Mike Tyson parks his limo 
in the wrong space at a nightclub and the attendant gives him static. Tyson is 
a tough hombre. Why didn't the guy simply back off? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Tyson parked his limo on the guy's foot. 
</P>
<P>
 First Jeffrey Leonard had his flaps-down home-run trot, and now he has his 
"sling-trot," where he carries one arm as if in a sling. What next? 
</P>
<P>
 After his next home run, Hac-Man will put on aviator goggles and a flowing 
scarf, and circle the bases on a moped. Of course, the very next Mariner batter 
will get a high, inside fastball lodged in his left nostril, but that's 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two sleazy sports agents, Norby and Lloyd, were you glad to see them 
brought to justice? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, those are the fellows who were convicted of using cash to lure 
athletes into signing improper contracts, and threatening to harm the athletes 
if they tried to renege. Gee, that sounds like a description of standard 
college athletic recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
How can you cheat a cheater? Punishing people for doing unethical things to 
big-time college athletic programs is like sending a guy to the electric chair 
for short-changing Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are getting the shaft from the schedule maker so far. They open 
the season with a horrendous trip, then open at home the afternoon after a 
night road game. Most of the players are very upset. Mickey Hatcher calls it 
"the worst schedule I've ever seen in the history of baseball." What should the 
Dodgers do? 
</P>
<P>
 Hire several violinists. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to last year's nail-chewing, steel-whiskered, tough-guy World 
Series champeens? 
</P>
<P>
Those guys, you could've sent on a trip by Greyhound and they would have showed 
up snarling and ready to play ball. Have the Dodgers regressed to the days when 
team performance would fall off if the postgame wine was improperly chilled? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they are trying to enlist public sympathy, which should be no problem, 
even though they're the highest-paid team in the big leagues at an average 
salary of $852,518. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps I'm being too harsh on the lads. For years it was the Angels who 
whined about getting jobbed on the scheduling, and look at how much good that 
complaining did for them. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm worried about Fernando Valenzuela's zip. Has anyone clocked slower this 
year on the Dodgers radar speed gun? 
</P>
<P>
 Only Nancy Reagan. And it was close. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela also clocked slower than Mike Scioscia, the plate umpire and Roger, 
the peanut vendor. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are sensitive about this. They are still steamed at the unknown 
wise guy who, just before Valenzuela's last start, painted a happy face on the 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidential to Desperately in Need of a Kind Word: 
</P>
<P>
 Love to help, dude, but I've got a twinge.

<DESCRIPT>  BASEBALL; SAFETY; NEIGHBORHOOD; CONTROVERSY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Residents of River Ranch Circle say they can't enjoy the serenity and safety
of their own back yards because of the baseballs that come sailing in from the
nearby Saratoga High School baseball field.;    "My wife and I have a little
girl and we don't feel she's safe in her own back yard," said David Guido, who
has lived on River Ranch Circle for eight years. "We've been getting balls
from day one, but it's become increasingly worse. Three balls once landed in
our yard during one game."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Another neighbor, Richard Ohren, escaped injury when he was hit by a ball
while gardening in his back yard last baseball season. But he said that
incident, plus many more near misses, illustrate how dangerous the situation
is.;    Tired of having their back yards turned into the left-field bleachers
at Saratoga High, the residents are pushing for either the city of Saratoga or
the Los Gatos Joint Union High School District to go to bat for them.;    "The
city or school district has to do something to protect us," said Guido.;   
The district's governing board and city council members will meet jointly next
month to discuss the problem and what each agency might be able to do to help
solve it.;    Residents expressed their concerns to district trustees late
last summer. They brought with them to the meeting dozens of baseballs they'd
collected over the years.;    Guido had two large garbage sacks full of balls,
including two dozen he'd picked up in his yard last baseball season alone.;   
"There was an astonishing number of baseballs collected from back yards," said
Superintendent Tod Likins, who was principal at Saratoga High from 1979 until
his appointment as superintendent last year.;    Likins said the longstanding
problem seems to stem from young adults batting the ball around, mostly on
weekends. He added that while it seems strange, given the price of baseballs
these days, that people would "stand there and pump balls over the fence, that
seems to be what's happening.";    Guido said sanctioned high school games are
the least of the problem.;    He said more balls have landed in his back yard
when adult leagues were using the field.;    The homes on River Ranch Circle
are behind the left-field fence. It is 310 feet from home plate to the
left-field foul pole. Right behind that are a 32-foot screened fence and an
access road.;    Guido said the problem intensified around four years ago when
some construction work removed trees that provided a natural barrier between
the homes and the field.;    Trustees in September passed a resolution
requesting that the city adopt an ordinance prohibiting the playing or
practicing of baseball, golf or archery on the Saratoga High School campus
without the written consent of the school district.;    The resolution stated
that the district had received complaints about "unsafe conduct by casual
users" of the campus and was unable to enforce use restrictions and the
policing of them without support from other local agencies.;    The city
council did not direct the city attorney to draft an ordinance at its meeting
earlier this month.;    City Manager Harry Peacock said city staff is studying
"to what extent we have the legal ability to enforce a city ordinance on
school district property.";    Residents claim the effective alternatives
include prohibiting all baseball games at the field, relocating the field to a
different part of the campus, or reorienting the diamond away from the homes.;
   Councilman Vic Monia said that with a reorientation of the field there
would be no disruption of its intended use and it would remain an active
recreational facility for the city.;    "And, it addresses the safety issue
the best way," Monia said. "If you get hit in the head, it doesn't matter
whether it was from a sanctioned baseball game or not. The balls still go over
the fence."  </TEXT>

TONY PENA: BUSY BODY IN NEED OF A REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Tony Pena isn't used to having much free time. 
</P>
<P>
He spent four falls playing football, two winters playing basketball and three 
springs playing baseball for Mater Dei High School. He also played four summers 
of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Pena sat out his freshman baseball season to rest. He ended his basketball 
career after playing on an undefeated junior-varsity team as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
His summer schedule indicates Pena isn't slowing up much, however, despite the 
fact he has dropped football from his play list. 
</P>
<P>
Pena graduated from Mater Dei two weeks ago, then spent 10 days relaxing on the 
beaches of Maui. He said he had a good time, which is a good thing. It might be 
the only break he gets this summer, assuming his tired pitching arm holds up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to keep it pretty mellow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He got off the plane from Hawaii Tuesday and played in the Orange County High 
School all-star baseball game that night. Pitching for the South, the 
right-hander gave up three runs in two innings, but was not involved in the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of embarrassed about the game," he said. "But I didn't pick up a 
ball for 10 days before that night." 
</P>
<P>
Pena was selected to play in a game that matched an Orange County high school 
all-star team against a team from Los Angeles County Thursday night. But he 
decided to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pena is supposed to be part of an Angelus League all-star team that 
plays a team of Sea View League all-stars at 3 p.m. at UC Irvine. He isn't sure 
if he will pitch, however. It depends how his arm feels. 
</P>
<P>
Pena also pitches for the Cardinals, a Connie Mack League youth team. He will 
take a break from the Cardinals, to pitch in the U.S. Olympic Sports Festival 
at Oklahoma City. He was selected, along with Chris Sheff of Laguna Hills, to 
play in the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the June free-agent draft, but he 
hasn't talked to them. He hasn't really had the time. 
</P>
<P>
Pena signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Arizona State. The Sun Devil 
coaches asked him to do one thing this summer -- rest his arm. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Arizona State) want me to take it easy," Pena said. "They want my arm to 
be strong when I get there in August." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 6-foot-2 and almost 200 pounds, was impressive this season for the 
league-champion Monarchs. Pena, who throws mostly a fastball and a split-finger 
fastball, was 12-2 with a 0.57 earned-run average. He had 88 strikeouts in 88 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We used him more than we have used any other pitcher here ever," Mater Dei 
Coach Bob Ickes said. "You could tell by the end of the season that he was 
tired. Maybe the best thing he could do is take a rest." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he noticed that he was losing something off his fastball toward the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's season ended in a 4-2 extra-inning loss to El Dorado, the eventual 
5-A Southern Section champion. Pena entered that game in the fourth inning and 
didn't allow a run until the eighth. Then El Dorado got three consecutive 
singles and a sacrifice fly to score two runs and end Mater Dei's season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd lost a little zip by the end," Pena said. "But I didn't want the season to 
end with me any other place than on the mound, win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
Pena was named the most valuable player in the Angelus League for the second 
consecutive season. He also was The Times' all-county first-team pitcher. As a 
junior, he was 9-0. He was 3-2 as a sophomore, also on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
His 24-4 career record was impressive, but Pena is also proud of another 
pitching accomplishment. He didn't allow a home run in a high school game. The 
feat is even more impressive when you consider that he pitched about half the 
time at Mater Dei, one of the smallest fields in the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that I knew about, but didn't really worry about," Pena said. 
"It just seemed that no matter what, the ball would stay in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Pena could have been busier this summer had he not given up a promising 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
Pena, a wide receiver, was second in Orange County with 64 receptions. He 
averaged 17.1 yards a catch and was an all-Angelus League and Times' all-county 
pick as well. He was selected by the Orange County Athletic Directors Assn. as 
the male athlete of the year for his work in football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was asked to play in the Orange County High School all-star game and the 
Shrine All-Star game, which features the best Los Angles area players. But he 
turned down both invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked football a lot," Pena said. "Being a receiver is a lot like being a 
pitcher. When you line up, it's only you and the guy across from you. I like 
that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to lead anybody (recruiters) on. I knew when football ended last 
fall that was it for me. I just had a feeling that baseball was going to be my 
sport. It's where I see my future." 
</P>
<P>
As long as he gets some rest.

A RUTHIAN CLOUT FOR THE GRAND OLD GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Now that the baseball season has ended, it's time to talk . . . baseball. 
</P>
<P>
To use sportsspeak, "Forever Baseball" can do it all. Airing at 9 tonight on 
Channels 28 and 15 as part of "The American Experience" on PBS, it's the Babe 
Ruth or Willie Mays of its genre, arguably the best TV program on baseball 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
And, happily, it offers not a single word from a modern player, manager or 
owner. That comes during the season. 
</P>
<P>
After the World Series was interrupted by the Bay Area's recent devastating 
earthquake, the common refrain was: "This puts baseball in context." Wrong. 
This program puts baseball in context -- a lyrical, exhilarating hour using 
wonderful bits of history, old clips and insights from literati to show the 
game's uniqueness in American culture. 
</P>
<P>
Television not only has dramatically changed the economic structure of baseball 
but also has made players seem less heroic through constant exposure. But the 
game's essence remains unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is more than America's enduring cliche; it's also America's song. The 
crack of the bat can't be described or explained, it must be heard. And it has 
been heard for 150 years. Producer-writer-narrator Irv Drasnin dusts off a 
quote: "I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the American game." 
The words are Walt Whitman's. 
</P>
<P>
When troops from the North and South weren't fighting the Civil War, they 
sometimes played baseball. When Custer was being annihilated, somewhere else in 
America people were playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It's this historical view -- and the perception of baseball as the nation's 
common denominator -- that makes Drasnin's video essay an upper-deck shot that 
clears the bases. 
</P>
<P>
We see baseball as symbolic: It starts in the spring, a time for renewal. 
Baseball is now universal, not only geographically, but demographically: "Hit 
it right" applies to performance in all areas of life. There is also the 
learned baseball behavior, ingrained since youth. As Drasnin notes: "There is a 
way to talk, a way to stand, a way to move, and when the ball comes at you, a 
way to make it look easy." Yes, and we daydream about it throughout our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball transcends age. Painter Ralph Fasanella, 75, on his newspaper 
priorities: "This morning there are two important things, Poland and China, but 
I gotta go to baseball first." 
</P>
<P>
The game transcends gender. Journalist-historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, on 
absorbing baseball from her father, for whom she kept score on Brooklyn Dodgers 
games: "I felt like I was learning the wisdom of the ages from him." 
</P>
<P>
Big-time baseball didn't always transcend race, however; indeed, it was a 
metaphor for segregation, as Drasnin recalls in an insightful sequence 
comparing the fortunes of Bob Feller and Satchel Paige. 
</P>
<P>
There is extraordinary archival footage here, too -- of the 1905 Giants, of the 
Babe demonstrating his swing to young players, of Lou Gehrig playing a cowboy 
in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, "Forever Baseball" defines a game that is hopeful, a game whose 
finality, unlike basketball and football, is not governed by a clock, a game 
that offers the possibility of miracles along with heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
What grand stuff, a program that hits it right. Break out the Cracker Jack.
