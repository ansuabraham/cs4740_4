   President-elect George Bush's bass-fishing
trip to a private lake Thursday will take him to a small, historic
community that once played host to another vice president, Aaron
Burr.
   Bush's itinerary calls for four hours of fishing with Ray Scott,
whose 55-acre lake is near the historic Pintlala site in rolling
terrain 15 miles south of Montgomery.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' said Scott, who became a
friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of Bush's in
1978. ``His fishing is so token, he doesn't have a chance to get at
it much.''
   Scott, who got a call from Bush to arrange the outing, has
brought attention to a crossroads community that is little more than
a small elementary school, a library, a fire station and Mosley's
store and service station.
   Reporters and photographers descended on Mosley's in anticipation
of the visit. ``It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said
Mary Meadows as she prepared hot dogs for the throng Wednesday.
   Scott said Secret Service agents checked out ``every squirrel
nest and deer stand'' on his property.
   Scott, who built the lake a couple of years ago and now has a
whitetail deer research program on his land, said the old Federal
Road that crossed through Pintlala _ a paved portion of which now
runs in front of Scott's gate _ was the route taken by Gen. Andrew
Jackson, later the nation's seventh president, on his way to New
Orleans during the War of 1812.
   Scott and historians also say Burr, the vice president who killed
Alexander Hamilton in a duel, paid an unplanned visit to Pintlala.
Burr was captured in Alabama in 1807 after being accused of treason
and was brought up the Federal Road. According to Scott, he spent
one night at Manac's Tavern in the town.
   Burr was acquitted of treason but remained disgraced and retired
from politics.
   Scott, who founded the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society two decades
ago and sold the publishing enterprise for $15 million in 1986, is a
conservationist who predicted Bush will rival Teddy Roosevelt in
supporting America's outdoors.
   ``He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time
for action,'' Scott said. ``He'll be reasonable but firm'' in
protecting the environment.

   President-elect Bush's bass fishing
excursion today takes him to a crossroads community that once played
host to another vice president _ Aaron Burr.
   Bush's itinerary calls for about four hours of fishing with
prominent Alabama sportsman Ray Scott, whose 55-acre private lake is
set in rolling countryside about 15 miles south of Montgomery.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' said Scott, who became a
friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of Bush in
1978. ``His fishing is so token, he doesn't have a chance to get at
it much.''
   Scott, who founded the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society two decades
ago and sold the publishing enterprise for $15 million in 1986, is
an outspoken conservationist who predicts Bush will rival Teddy
Roosevelt in supporting America's outdoors.
   ``He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time
for action,'' said Scott in an interview. ``He'll be reasonable but
firm'' in protecting the environment.
   Scott, who got a Thanksgiving Day call from Bush to arrange the
bass fishing outing, has brought attention to a farm community that
is composed mainly of a small elementary school, a library, a fire
station and Mosley's store and service station at the junction of
U.S. 31 and Federal Road.
   Scott, who also has a whitetail deer research program on his
land, enjoys talking about the legends of Pintlala, including visits
made by White House figures prior to Bush.
   He said the old Federal Road that crossed through Pintlala _ a
paved portion of which now runs in front of Scott's gate _ was the
route taken by Gen. Andrew Jackson on his way to New Orleans for the
battle of 1812. Scott and historians also say Burr, the vice
president who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, paid an unplanned
visit to Pintlala in 1807.
   Burr was was captured in southwest Alabama on treason charges in
Februrary 1807 and was brought up the Federal Road. Scott said Burr
spent one night at Manac's Tavern, which was located at a site about
a quarter-mile from Scott's property at Pintlala.
   ``Pintlala is a Creek Indian word that means `fish swamp.' It
once was a heavy Creek settlement,'' said Scott. ``Manac's Tavern
was owned by Sam Manac, a Creek with large landholdings.... Manac's
son, David, was the first Indian ever to graduate from West Point.''
   The news media descended on Mosley's store and service station in
anticipation of Bush's visit.
   ``It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said Mary Meadows
as she prepared hot dogs for the lunch crowd Wednesday. Scott said
Secret Service agents had checked out ``every squirrel nest and deer
stand'' on his property.
   The only overt indication that the president-elect was on his way
was a sign outside the Pintlala Baptist Church. It read: ``Welcome
President Bush. Godspeed and Good Fishing.''
   Scott, who remains as a figurehead of the B.A.S.S. operation,
plays host at its fishing tournaments, some of which are carried on
cable television.
   Scott said he met Bush in Montgomery about 10 years ago and was
asked to manage Bush's 1980 campaign in Alabama. ``I'm not sure his
pickin' was too good, otherwise he wouldn't have picked me,'' said
Scott, recalling their loss to Ronald Reagan in the state's primary.
   ``But I'm a good salesman. That's about all politics is anyway,''
he said. ``We just always clicked.''

<HEAD>Newly Found Letters Offer Insight Into Early American Explorers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLEN G. BREED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-hidden cache of personal letters
unveiled Monday should give historians new insight into one of the
leaders of the famed Lewis and Clark expedition that explored the
northern Plains and the Northwest.
   The 47 letters from Capt. William Clark - five of them written
during the 1803-1806 expedition into the newly acquired Louisiana
Territory - are a ``tremendous find,'' said James R. Bentley,
executive director of the Filson Club, the Louisville historical
repository that now owns the letters.
   Among the more important illuminations are Clark's thoughts on
the mysterious death in 1809 of expedition commander Meriwether
Lewis and his opinion of the treacherous Aaron Burr, vice president
under Thomas Jefferson, whose $15 million Louisiana Purchase
doubled the nation's size.
   The letters, dated from 1792 to 1811, are addressed to Gen.
Jonathan Clark, the explorer's older brother. Until two years ago
the letters were hidden away in the Louisville attic of Clark's
descendants.
   Some historians have argued that Lewis, then governor of the
territory he helped explore and map, was murdered on his way to
Washington, D.C., but Clark's letters support the theory that his
friend killed himself.
   ``Clark clearly indicates in his letters that he believed Lewis
was in an unstable state of mind and was very capable of committing
suicide,'' said James J. Holmberg, curator of manuscripts for the
Filson Club.
   In one letter, Clark calls Lewis a ``poor fellow'' who was
``much distressed'' about how the public might perceive his
handling of financial matters in the territory.
   Holmberg said that in another letter Clark tells how Lewis had
asked him and others to help sell his property and settle his debts
shortly before his death.
   References to Burr, perhaps best known for killing Treasury
Secretary Alexander Hamilton in a duel, turn up frequently in the
correspondence.
   The references focus on Burr's alleged attempts to raise an army
and overthrow the government. In his letters, Clark refers to Burr
as a ``second Napoleon,'' Holmberg said.
   ``He told President Jefferson that Burr was a real danger and
that something needs to be done about him,'' Holmberg said. ``And
something was. He was arrested.''
   The letters will force revision of several biographies, Holmberg
said, including that of Clark's slave, York, who accompanied the
group on the excursion.
   Holmberg said a 1985 book about York - ``In Search of York,'' by
Robert Betts - was extremely thorough. But he said new information
in the letters explains some important events in York's life, such
as how Clark's refusal to reunite York with his slave wife caused
an irreparable rift between the two men.
   The Clark descendants just recently completed the legal process
of turning the documents over to the Filson Club, which now owns
six of the 12 existing letters Clark wrote during the expedition.
The six others are scattered in other collections. The Filson Club
would not disclose what it paid for the letters.
   Winifred George of St. Louis, incoming president of the
1,500-member, Montana-based Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage
Foundation, said it was a ``wonderful'' find.
   ``It's been some years since something new has been
discovered,'' George said. ``We often forget how important that
expedition was to the entire westward development,'' she said.
   Bentley acknowledged that the documents won't exactly rewrite
the history books, but said they offer illuminating details.
   ``What struck me most was the insight on William Clark ... It
shows a side of him that would hard to find otherwise,'' he said.

<TEXT>     Agnew, who resigned in disgrace in 1973 after pleading no contest to tax
evasion, is the only former vice president missing from the gallery of carved
figures that represents the men who toiled a heartbeat away from being chief
executive. Even the bust of the most recent former vice president -- George
Bush -- waits in storage for its pedestal.;    Across from Mondale's bust is
the visage of his predecessor, Nelson Rockefeller, on a brown marble stand
next to the likeness of Gerald Ford, Agnew's successor. But on the other side
of the tiled hallway sits the bust of Theodore Roosevelt. And next to the
Mondale bust is an antique wooden clock.;    The likeness of the former
Maryland governor, the first vice president to resign under legal fire, is
nowhere to be found on two floors of statuary decorating the place where vice
presidents have served as presidents of the Senate.;    In "The Capitol," a
picture book published by the Government Printing Office, page after page
shows marble busts. For Agnew's entry, there is a snapshot and the caption,
"pending.";    UNDER a Senate resolution passed in 1898, the architect of the
Capitol or the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee contacts the vice
president -- or his family -- after he leaves office for the commission of a
formal bust.;    "I don't know what the reason is. I guess we're waiting for
the family or the committee," said William F. Raines Jr., a spokesman for the
architect of the Capitol, acknowledging that Agnew is the only one among the
43 former vice presidents whose bust has not been commissioned.;    "It's
generally handled by the architect's office," said Jim King, a spokesman for
the Senate Rules Committee.;    The subject of an Agnew bust comes up "from
time to time, when something might happen on that," Raines said. "We don't
have anything in the Agnew file." He added quickly, "We don't even have a file
on that.";    George M. White, architect of the Capitol since 1971, said the
staff or family of the last several vice presidents called his office to start
the process.;    "It's probably as much my neglect as theirs," said White, who
blamed his lack of initiative on other Capitol chores.;    Agnew, a
businessman now living in Southern California, could not be reached for
comment, but Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., believes that the former vice
president has been snubbed.;    'H E hasn't been treated fairly," said
Bentley, a former U.S. maritime commissioner. "He did step down, true, and he
was under pressure. We need to look at the whole picture. Others who have been
in that position have been under fire.";    Not only under fire but fired
upon. The nation's third vice president, Aaron Burr, was charged by New Jersey
and New York for shooting Alexander Hamilton in a duel but was never brought
to trial. He also was tried on treason charges but was acquitted.;    Schuyler
Colfax, vice president from 1869 to 1873, was deeply implicated in a bribery
scandal but remained in office after the House of Representatives declined to
start impeachment proceedings.;    Both men are memorialized by marble busts,
as is former Vice President Richard Nixon, whose bust was completed in 1965 --
long before Watergate -- and is prominently displayed outside a Senate chamber
door.;    White denied that there was any deliberate effort to block the
commissioning of an Agnew bust. "Not on my part, and I'm the one who's
supposed to do it," he said.;    When White was asked whether he would contact
the former vice president about a bust, he said, "Now that you mention it, I
probably should."  </TEXT>

<HL> When President Is a Four-Letter Word
---
By Matthew Cossolotto</HL>
<DD> 02/27/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Call it four-letter chic. 
All of a sudden the 1988 presidential field is swarming with possible contenders who have one thing in common -- four-letter last names. 

   This is an odd situation. 
We have had only three four-letter chief executives: James Polk, William Taft and Gerald Ford -- who was appointed, not elected, to both the vice presidency and presidency. 
Three out of 40 is not what you would call an overwhelming percentage. 
The odds may be stacked against the current crop of four-letter Oval Office aspirants. 

   Who are they? 
The Republicans boast at least four principal possibilities: Vice President George Bush, Rep. Jack Kemp, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole. 
Some people suggest that Sen. Dole's wife, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, should consider running. 
And Horace Busby, former aide to President Lyndon Johnson, includes New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean on his so-called "twitch list" of potential candidates. 

   The Democrats have no shortage in this department, either. 
Until recently, there were three four-letter Democrats widely touted for the presidency: former Sen. Gary Hart, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, and former Virginia Gov. Chuck Robb. 
The list is growing. 
A recent Newsweek article says Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore is a potential candidate. 
And Mr. Busby's "twitch list" includes a prominent Democratic spokesman on foreign policy, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut. 

   It was way back in 1845 that James Polk, the only Democrat with a four-letter name to occupy the White House, became president. 
Messrs. 
Hart, Robb, Nunn, Gore and Dodd may want to take this into account as they consider their presidential prospects. 
Mr. Hart, in particular, may have some new grounds for debating the wisdom of his decision to shorten his last name from Hartpence. 

   Rare as four-letter presidents have been, four-lettered vice presidents have come almost as few and far between -- only four. 
One, Aaron Burr, is infamous, having killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. 
Another, William King, vice president in 1853 during the Pierce administration, died the same year he was inaugurated. 
The other two, Gerald Ford and George Bush, happen to be among the three most recent Republican vice presidents, Nelson Rockefeller being the multisyllabic exception. 
This recent trend, if that is what it is, may give hope to Republican vice presidential aspirants with four-letter surnames. 

   (Just for the record, 21 presidents have had two-syllable last names, while 11 presidential names have contained three syllables. 
Three presidents have had one-syllable last names not of four letters, and just one president -- Dwight Eisenhower -- has had four syllables in his last name.) 

   What can account for such a dismal showing of individuals with four-letter names? 
My own theory posits that Americans, already measurably cynical about politicians, simply want to avoid associating their national leaders with four-letter words. 
Lest the four-letter candidates get too discouraged -- and the other candidates become carried away with their good fortune -- bear this in mind: The first real test of presidential timber in 1988 comes in Iowa, a four-letter state. 

   Mr. Cossolotto, an aide in the House, has no current intentions of running for president or shortening his name.

SOUTH CAROLINA'S OLD GEORGETOWN HARBORS SOME INTERESTING SECRETS

<P>
As much as any town can today, the historic colonial port of Georgetown has the 
look of the Old South, and like much of the South it is rife with ghosts. I 
think I may have a crush on one of them. That's really how I happened to find 
Georgetown in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered down the East Coast are several charming old towns that thrived 
briefly as cosmopolitan centers, and then faded into the pages of history. 
</P>
<P>
I think of the shipping port of Salem in Massachusetts, which eventually 
declined as Boston grew, and nearby Annapolis, the Maryland capital that slept 
while Baltimore prospered. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, I stumbled this spring across yet another one, Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Once reputedly the world's rice-exporting capital, it now is a quiet but 
appealing backwater that was long ago overshadowed by Charleston to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Like Salem and Annapolis, however, it has preserved many of the gorgeous old 
homes built by wealthy families in the town's heyday before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown is about midway on the 100-mile drive down the South Carolina coast 
from Myrtle Beach to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
I had never heard of the town before my Carolina trip this spring, and I 
remained unaware of its colonial significance until I got there. I might have 
hurried right through, except for Aaron Burr's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
I have read a couple of fairly recent biographies of Burr, the urbane but 
notorious U.S. vice president who fatally wounded Alexander Hamilton in a 
famous duel. 
</P>
<P>
One of the saddest periods in Burr's always-dramatic life was the tragic death 
of his intelligent and beautiful daughter Theodosia, wife of the governor of 
South Carolina, Joseph Alston. 
</P>
<P>
Planning to visit her father in New York City, Theodosia boarded a ship leaving 
South Carolina on Dec. 31, 1812. The ship vanished without a trace, an unsolved 
mystery. Perhaps pirates attacked -- one of the legends surrounding Theodosia 
-- or it was sunk by a fierce gale known to have hit the coast. 
</P>
<P>
For some unexplainable reason, Theodosia and the story of her untimely death 
intrigued me. I am usually forgetful of names, but I retain hers. Can I have 
formed a romantic crush across the centuries? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of the most admired women of her day. So it was with astonishment 
and great delight that I read her name on a historical marker a few miles 
outside Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
I am a sucker for these roadside snippets from the past, and more often than 
not I'm rewarded with an interesting historic anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
The sign informed me that Theodosia and her husband had lived in the Georgetown 
area. Their home site is now a part of Brookgreen Gardens, a large sculpture 
garden, just north of town, that's filled with an inviting mix of classically 
heroic and charmingly whimsical pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Georgetown is the port from which Theodosia departed to meet her death. 
A huge 18th-Century mansion, the Man-Doyle House, still stands on Front Street, 
where she is said to have danced the night before the fatal trip. 
</P>
<P>
I decided I had to stop here for a while, drawn by my odd fascination with 
Theodosia. It is by such unexpected paths that travel discoveries are made. 
</P>
<P>
I gave myself an hour's time, but my visit stretched for another as 
Georgetown's attractions revealed themselves. A weekend would have been more 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Several bed and breakfast inns offer lodgings in or near the impressive 
Georgetown Historic District, which covers several blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Shaded by a canopy of moss-draped oaks, Georgetown sits at the confluence of 
four rivers forming Winyah Bay. It might have been America's oldest European 
community, but the Spanish who settled in 1526 were quickly driven out by 
Indians and disease. The heritage, instead, is British, dating from 1729. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 homes, buildings and sites from the 1700s still remain in the 
historic district. Information about escorted or self-directed walking tours is 
available at the local chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The Harold Kaminski House, built about 1760, is a museum filled with antiques 
reflecting Georgetown's link to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is no longer a commercial crop in South Carolina's coastal low country, 
but Georgetown today boasts a large and active shrimp-fishing fleet, which adds 
a definite bustle to its attractive waterfront setting. 
</P>
<P>
The town's colorful history is full of ghostly legends -- actually, Georgetown 
County enjoys some fame as the most haunted place in the South -- and the 
shrimping fleet has its own bag of superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 shrimp trawlers operate from the Georgetown wharf, all of them 
sporting tall masts. The top of each mast, I noticed, is painted white. 
</P>
<P>
A curious coincidence? I wondered. Not a coincidence at all, but rather 
something of a safety feature, I was told by Bill Oberst, a young history buff 
in the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce. His family dates back to the town's 
colonial origins. 
</P>
<P>
The local lore maintains, according to Oberst, that if a shrimping vessel 
starts to sink, the white mast provides an appropriately clean spot "where the 
hand of God can grab hold and pull the boat back up to safety." 
</P>
<P>
This city's local legends are brought to life in an annual summer theater 
production called "Ghosts of the Coast." 
</P>
<P>
In my short stay, I strolled along Harbor Walk, a boardwalk that stretches for 
a couple of blocks along the waterfront, where you can dine pleasantly on fresh 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
And I stepped inside the small but very interesting Rice Museum on Front 
Street, which tells the story of Georgetown's once-flourishing rice culture. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Civil War, the region supported more than 150 plantations, including 
one owned by Theodosia and her husband. But the end of slavery made cultivation 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Machines were developed that might have replaced slave labor, but they sank 
deep in the swampy soil of the low country. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Georgetown, a number of the old rice plantations have been 
restored as private homes. 
</P>
<P>
Although these fine old mansions are not open to the public, daily river boat 
tours sail past them on the same murky river ways that served the plantations 
as commercial highways two centuries ago. Watch for alligators on one narrow 
stretch of the route called "Alligator Alley." 
</P>
<P>
My two hours passed too quickly, as I sniffed the sea air and walked along 
elegant old streets exploring another chapter in America's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
Oberst said he can stand under an old oak tree and feel things from the town's 
long past. I don't doubt him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on Front Street before the Man-Doyle House, I easily imagined that I 
saw fair Theodosia in the second-floor ballroom enjoying a final dance before 
her fateful voyage. 
</P>

Again, Burr and Lorenzo Part Company
As People's Founder Leaves Texas Air

   The last time Donald C. Burr parted company with Texas Air Corp.'s Frank Lorenzo, he had big plans. 
He left in 1980 to build an innovative new airline from scratch: People Express. 

   Now, only a few months after Texas Air acquired People Express, Mr. Burr will be leaving Mr. Lorenzo's employ again. 
Mr. Burr, 45 years old, resigned effective this week as executive vice president of Texas Air, a post he had held only two months. 
But this time, his plans after Texas Air are far less ambitious. 
"Right now is a good time to just look around," he says. 

   There has been speculation about Mr. Burr's departure ever since Texas Air's acquisition of People Express reunited Mr. Burr with Mr. Lorenzo, his former low-fare competitor. 
Mr. Burr said that his dealings with the Texas Air chairman and chief executive officer were cordial, but he declined to be specific about his reasons for leaving. 
"I know -- surprise, surprise," Mr. Burr said in an interview. 
"But this was a mutually agreed-upon deal. 
We'll have to let people speculate about why." 

   The ups and downs of their past association were more conspicuous. 
In the days when the pair worked closely at Texas International, the predecessor of Texas Air, Mr. Burr was best man at Mr. Lorenzo's wedding. 
After Mr. Burr left to start up People Express with another Texas International alumnus, Gerald Gitner, the two airlines competed in several markets, and both made a run at Frontier Airlines last year. 
Mr. Burr won that round, but only to see his faltering empire bought at a cut-rate price by Mr. Lorenzo, several months later. 

   Mr. Burr's new role at Texas Air was never outwardly apparent. 
He was named executive vice president of Texas Air in February, and a board member of Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air. 
But his name was notably absent from a list of top management in company stock prospectuses last month. 
Even stranger was the sale of stock of Jet Capital Corp. to Mr. Burr -- which many took as a clue that he was among the tight circle of executives who run Texas Air. 
Jet Capital, a financial holding company controlled by Mr. Lorenzo, holds a class of Texas Air stock that controls appointments to three-quarters of the Texas Air board. 

   Mr. Burr claims there were never plans for him at Texas Air in the long term. 
He said the Jet Capital stock sale was part of his "incentive package" negotiated last fall. 
He received no severance package, and even laughed at the idea. 
"No golden parachute," he said. 
Mr. Burr said he has paid about $125,000, a one-quarter down payment on the Jet Capital stock, and isn't certain whether he will keep the stock. 

   Now that the operations of People Express have been merged into those of Continental, he said it was the proper time to leave. 
The poor service in the initial combined operations lived up to People Express's old nickname: "People Distress." 
The combined People and Continental operations resembled People's final days -- mountains of lost bags and dozens of canceled flights, but Texas Air says they have improved greatly since. 

   "I don't feel like we did as good as we could have, but it could have been a . . . lot worse," Mr. Burr said. 
He said he is satisfied because no People Express employees lost jobs in the merger, though many incurred financial losses after borrowing from People Express to buy People Express stock. 

   He won't discuss his plans, beyond writing a book about his experiences at People Express, the cult-like company in which all employees were "managers," and to whom Mr. Burr would often give inspirational speeches via video screens. 
"There was some powerful learning in those strong early years," he said, "and I learned from the mistakes in the later years." 

   He hinted that perhaps that experience won't be for naught. 
"Some people are saying there's only going to be six major airlines," he said. 
"I certainly don't think it's going to be the case. 
We'll have to wait and see."

<HEAD>North Tactic Revives Old Debate: Can A President Be Forced To Testify?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The effort by Oliver North to compel President
Reagan and President-elect Bush to testify at his Iran-Contra trial
has renewed a debate, almost as old as the Union, over ``executive
privilege.''
   Can a president, or a former one, be forced to testify in a legal
case? Courts have provided little guidance, but constitutional
experts said Tuesday that North's legal tactic may succeed.
   No sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal
trial, but several have provided testimony or what might be
considered the equivalent.
   The personal stakes are high for North. The former White House
aide is charged with theft, conspiracy to defraud the government and
several other felonies in the case involving the support of
Nicaraguan rebels with money from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.
   His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 31 _ just 11 days after Bush
is to succeed Reagan. Besides Reagan and Bush, subpoenas also have
been issued for other key figures in the Reagan administration,
including Secretary of State George P. Shultz and four other State
Department officials.
   The man who first tried to force a president to testify was Aaron
Burr, a former vice president who stood trial in 1807 on charges of
treason.
   Burr sought to force Thomas Jefferson, the president under whom
he had served, to testify at the trial.
   Jefferson resisted. But Chief Justice John Marshall, presiding
over the trial, ruled against Jefferson. The president eventually
avoided having to appear by releasing some information Burr had
sought.
   The closest the Supreme Court has come to ruling on the issue
presented by North's subpoena came in the Watergate tapes decision
of 1974, in a case called Nixon vs. U.S.
   The court then ruled, 8-0, that President Richard M. Nixon had to
comply with a special prosecutor's subpoena seeking the surrender of
White House tape recordings.
   ``The general assertion of privilege must yield to the
demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal
trial,'' the high court ruled 15 years ago.
   Jerome Barron, a law professor at George Washington University
here, said Tuesday the 1974 decision is a strong precedent for North.
   ``Whether Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush can be subpoenaed was resolved
in Nixon vs. U.S., and the answer is yes,'' Barron said.
   ``If the evidence (sought by North) is material, I think Reagan
and Bush can be required to appear,'' Barron said.
   On the other hand, unnamed Justice Department sources were quoted
by The Washington Post as saying that Nixon vs. U.S. offers support
for fighting subpoenas of Reagan and Bush. They said the Supreme
Court emphasized that its Watergate-tapes decision did not deal with
a claim of privilege based on national security grounds.
   Justice Department and White House officials have said they will
try to have the subpoenas thrown out.
   Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who once served as general
counsel to the House of Representatives, said North may succeed.
   ``My sense is North has a good claim. The president was involved
in the process, and one of North's defenses is that he was serving
the president by following orders,'' Brand said.
   In 1975, then-President Gerald R. Ford gave a videotaped
deposition in the trial of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who was
convicted of trying to assassinate Ford. The videotape was played
for jurors at Fromme's trial.
   While in office, President Jimmy Carter provided videotaped
testimony in two criminal prosecutions.

   Donald C. Burr, founder and former chairman of People Express Inc., was named executive vice president of Texas Air Corp., effective Feb. 1. 

   Mr. Burr, 45, was president of Texas International Airlines, the forerunner of Texas Air, before he left to start People Express in 1981. 
Texas Air has acquired People Express and will fold its operations into those of its Continental Airlines unit. 

   Mr. Burr left Texas International after feuds with Frank Lorenzo, then-chairman and chief executive officer of the carrier, and currently chairman of Texas Air. 
As head of People Express, Mr. Burr continued to battle Mr. Lorenzo as a competitor. 
After the takeover of People Express last month, it was been unclear what Mr. Burr would do. 

   Mr. Burr also will serve as a director and chairman of the executive committee of Continental Airlines. 
Texas Air said that Mr. Burr, among other duties, will be involved in personnel management and development at Continental.

   A gunman described in a pyschological
examination as unlikely to harm his ex-wife burst into her house
early Friday and killed her, their two daughters and her new
husband before killing himself.
   Neighbors identified the man, who left a note telling his
parents he was ``sorry for what he had to do,'' as Ronald Richard
Burris, 46.
   The others, all shot to death, included his ex-wife, Shirley Mae
Woody, 41, the couple's daughters, Vicki Marie Burris, 14, and Anne
Marie Burris, 6, and Shirley Woody's husband, Robert James Woody,
31.
   It was one of three murder-suicides reported around the nation
on Friday in which 12 people died.
   In Belleville, Ill., a man identified as 48-year-old Kurt
Steibel shot and killed his wife, daughter and 1-year-old grandson,
then shot at firefighters before committing suicide by re-entering
his burning home, authorities said.
   After firefighters recovered Steibel's body, they found the
bodies of his wife, Carolyn, and his daughter Cindy Townley, whose
ages were unavailable, and his grandson, Eric Townley. X-rays
showed that they had been shot to death. Police said they hadn't
determined a motive.
   In Buxton, N.D., authorities said farmer Wayne Nygaard, 42,
apparently shot his wife, Carol, 40, and their 11-year-old
daughter, Kate, before turning the gun on himself. The bodies were
found by the couple's 17-year-old son; authorities did not cite a
motive.
   In the Washington state case, authorities said Burris was armed
with a handgun and a shotgun.
   ``We have seasoned firefighters who were disturbed at what they
found,'' Fire District Capt. Bruce Carpenter said of the scene.
   ``We don't know for sure why he did it, except here you have an
ex-husband and a divorce that wasn't the nicest in the world,''
Curt Benson, spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department,
said as he stood on the rainswept, tree-lined street outside the
home.
   Divorce and child custody and support records, along with a 1988
court order barring Burris from contact with his ex-family, show a
19-year marriage that broke up in 1987 after Shirley Burris accused
her husband of sexually molesting their daughters.
   The accusation, investigated by state child protective workers,
did not result in criminal charges against Burris, according to
records on file at the Peirce County Clerk's office in nearby
Tacoma.
   Burris, who was a civilian logistics supply official at nearby
McChord Air Force Base, denied the allegations in the divorce and
custody papers, calling them ``a wilfull and malevolent'' charge.
   His ex-wife later called him ``so anti-mother that the girls
resent it.'' That comment was made in a sworn statement used to
uphold a February 1988 restraining order barring Burris from
contact with his daughters and living within two miles of his
ex-wife's home.
   A psychological examination in September 1988 found that if
Burris was ``seriously inclined to do her harm, he would already
have done so,'' according to custody dispute records. Burris
submitted to the exam as a condition for getting the restraint
order lifted.
   Benson said Burris awoke his victims when he smashed through a
sliding glass door at the rear of the house and shot Woody in the
couple's bedroom as he called sheriff's deputies to report the
break-in.
   When deputies arrived minutes later, at about 5:12 a.m. PST,
they found Burris' body in the living room where he had committed
suicide, Benson said.
   ``We then went into the master bedroom. We found a husband and
wife on the floor. Both died of apparent gunshot wounds.''
   Anne, 6, was found dead in her bedroom, and a 14-year-old Vicki
was shot in the doorway to her room, he said.
   Principals at the schools the girls attended said they had told
their pupils of the deaths and brought in psychologists to counsel
the children.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a small coastal town in rural southeast
Georgia, you used to get the impression that anything destined to
happen there happened long ago. That was before the Navy started
building a $1.7 billion base for 10 Trident submarines, which begin
arriving this month with their nuclear arsenals. St. Marys is
unlikely ever to be the same again.

   Just across the tracks from the antebellum
charm of historic St. Marys, where old oaks drip Spanish moss, a new
nuclear submarine base is changing the face of the countryside with
shopping malls and low-cost housing.
   The Kings Bay Submarine Base, to be home to the Trident subs,
means stability, money and lots of jobs in this area on the
southeastern tip of Georgia, just north of Jacksonville, Fla. But
the boom also is bringing urban-style headaches to rural Camden
County.
   The base, under construction for a decade, will add more than
22,000 people to the population of Camden County, which had only
about 13,000 in 1980.
   Planners are worried about schools, crime, water and sewer
systems, libraries, fire protection and recreational facilities.
   The county had no movie theater until recently. Now a six-theater
cinema complex has opened in a shopping center and another is
probable for a center being built down the road.
   The county's landfill, projected to last up to 40 years, was used
up in 10 because of the base-related boom.
   From 1980 to 1988, school enrollment in the area increased 54
percent. Projections show that in 1995, enrollment will be 173
percent above the 1980 level.
   Backers of the base say the Navy is trying hard to be a good
neighbor.
   Even so, says Roger Alderman of the Kings Bay Impact Coordinating
Committee, ``The degree that it affects a small area, especially one
such as Camden County, is unimaginable.''
   The first Trident submarine was to arrive at the $1.7 billion
base on Jan. 14, welcomed in an invitation-only ceremony.
   Eventually the base will house 10 Trident subs, each carrying 24
missiles packing eight nuclear warheads per missile. Each warhead is
35 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima,
Japan, in 1945.
   Each submarine will have more atomic destructive capacity than
most nuclear powers, but if the people of St. Marys are nervous
about that, it is subdued. The few protests held at the base have
not been locally organized.
   Over the centuries _ up to now _ residents of St. Marys have
preserved its charm with a minimum of tackiness.
   The Spanish settled the community in 1566 and stayed 120 years.
Aaron Burr came to town in 1804 after killing Alexander Hamilton in
a duel. In the 1930s, cartoonist Roy Crane visited and was so taken
by the town streetcar that he used it as a model for his
``Toonerville Trolly.''
   Visitors to St. Marys once got the impression that anything
destined to happen here happened long ago. The nearness of the base
is changing that.
   Crime is up, although local officials blame transient
construction workers, not the military, for most of it.
   Low-cost housing developments are popping up everywhere. Only
about 600 Navy personnel, mostly in the lower ranks, will be housed
on the base.
   Fields and pine woods have given way to shopping malls, and the
mushrooming strip of development along Highway 40 is cheek by jowl
with the city limits.
   Tom Sterling, 80, runs the grocery store his father founded more
than 100 years ago in St. Marys.
   ``We used to sell everything here, from horse collars on up, or
maybe I should say on down,'' he says.
   Old friends stop by to pass the time and remember when.
   But the shelves are thinly stocked these days and customers are
few. Malls and shopping centers built for the base trade, Sterling
says, are drawing shoppers from St. Marys' few businesses as well.
   In the basement of Orange Hall, a Greek Revival splendor from the
1820s, Elvira Wildes tends a small information center.
   The Navy, she says, has gone out of its way to put the base in a
positive light, especially to St. Marys' older residents.
   `They come to tell us the facts,'' she says. ``They told us it is
the only Navy base being started from scratch. They give us tours on
the ships, and we eat in the mess hall sometimes.
   ``If there is dirt and trash going on, and if there are people
acting like they shouldn't, well I don't go to those places so I
don't know about those things.''
   There is no entertainment in St. Marys, she observes correctly.
``So why would they bother us?''
   ``It is not an adversarial relationship,'' agrees Kenneth Kent, a
financial analyst with the Coordinating Committee, which is trying
to soften the impact of the base on the area. ``The Navy is trying
to be a good neighbor.''
   Alderman says the federally funded committee, made up of local
government leaders, ``is to lay out the realities of a high-growth
area and foresee problems down the road.''
   The area has received some $37.5 million in federal impact
payments since 1984. Alderman says Washington wanted to make 1989
the last year for impact funding.
   ``We estimate we would need $8.7 million in 1991 and $5.3 million
in 1992,'' he says. ``The Navy isn't even thinking in terms of 1991
or 1992.''
   Kent says a residential tax base generally is not sufficient to
support residential services.
   ``There is virtually no industrial tax base here and only a
nominal commercial base,'' he says.
   Much of the county is in timber, which is taxed at a low rate and
thus provides little county income, he says.
   The county school tax already is 9 percent above that of other
counties in the region, he says, and Camden County cannot absorb
even the matching portions of the increased cost.
   ``The current tax situation allows counties to keep up existing
schools but not to build new ones required by the increase in
population,'' Kent says.
   ``A high percentage of the jobs on the base were to go to the
local people but this has not happened the way it was expected to,''
Alderman says.
   Because special skills are needed for many jobs, he says, Camden
County area residents generally have gotten lower-paying jobs toward
the service end of the scale.
   ``Both the Navy and the region realize the need for a
job-training program,'' he says.
   Alderman says Navy officials at St. Marys are aware of the
problems and are trying to get Washington to do more.
   ``The critical point is at hand,'' Alderman says. ``We have found
out now what has to be done.''

   Today is Friday, Feb. 17, the 48th day of 1989. There are 317
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Feb. 17, 1964, 25 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its
``one man, one vote'' decision, ruling that congressional districts
within each state must be roughly equal in population.
   On this date:
   In 1801, the U.S. House of Representatives broke an electoral tie
between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, electing Jefferson
president. Burr became vice president.
   In 1817, a street in Baltimore became the first to be lighted

   History is repeating itself rather quickly in
the demand by Oliver North that former President Reagan come from
his home in California to testify for North at his criminal trial.
   There was a gap of 167 years between the time Thomas Jefferson
was subpoenaed and the 1974 summons to Richard Nixon, by then an
ex-president. Less than 15 years passed before the subpoena for
Reagan.
   During the 1974 Watergate cover-up trial, former aide John D.
Ehrlichman almost succeeded in his request for Nixon's appearance.
It would have happened, too, had the former president not fallen
critically ill following surgery.
   ``I would have loved to have Nixon in court, I had a few
questions I wanted to ask him myself,'' U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica wrote in his memoirs.
   But at the time, a team of court-appointed doctors determined
that Nixon would be in no condition to travel for some time, which
would have delayed the trial. ``I ruled reluctantly,'' Sirica
remembered of his decision that the former president would not have
to appear. ``I did feel that no matter how anxious many of us were
to see Nixon face the lawyers and testify under oath, having him in
court was not really critical to Ehrlichman's defense.''
   Had he gone on the witness stand, Nixon would have been the
first ex-president to do so under subpoena. That dubious
distinction will fall to Reagan if U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell accedes to North's request.
   The debate whether a president must obey subpoenas and other
court orders dates to the beginning of the republic, and it is just
as volatile today as it was then.
   President Thomas Jefferson received a subpoena in 1807 demanding
that he turn over a letter sought by defense lawyers in the treason
case against Aaron Burr, Jefferson's first vice president.
   Burr wanted Jefferson to appear in court and testify about the
letter written to the president by one of Burr's alleged
co-conspirators. Chief Justice John Marshall, presiding over the
trial, declared that the president unlike a king was subject to law.
   Jefferson cited the independence of the executive branch of
government from the judicial branch and refused, at first, to
release the letter. Eventually, he turned it over but made clear
that his decision was voluntary and not in response to the subpoena.
   From then until Watergate, the concept of executive privilege
was never tested. No sitting president ever has testified in court
in a criminal trial, although several have provided testimony or
what might be considered an equivalent.
   It is not difficult to see why North's lawyers want Reagan to
testify. Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan has attempted to show,
in his cross examination of prosecution witnesses, that Reagan was
much more involved in the secret aid to the Contra rebels than was
known publicly before.
   The jury heard that Reagan personally approved an
NSC-recommended deal in 1985 to give Honduras $110 million in
covert economic and military aid as an inducement to support the
Contras.
   The jury also heard that Reagan apparently approved a plan from
North and others in the government to airdrop intelligence data and
recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose of destroying
ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government.
   Those actions all were at a time when Congress had banned U.S.
military aid to the Contras.
   The closest the Supreme Court has come to ruling on so-called
executive privilege was in the Watergate tapes case of 1974. The
special prosecutor had subpoenaed the White House for tapes of 64
conversation and Nixon didn't want to give them up.
   In the case called Nixon v. U.S. the court ruled unanimously
that Nixon had to comply with the subpoena. The specific need for
evidence in a criminal case, the court said, outweighed the
president's rights in the matter.
   In 1975, President Gerald Ford gave a videotaped deposition as a
defense witness in the trial of Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme who was
convicted of attempting to assassinate Ford. Lawyers for the
administration tried unsuccessfully to have the court accept a
written statement by the president. The videotape was played in
court.
   Jimmy Carter, too, as president, gave videotaped testimony _
twice. Once was as a government witness in the perjury and gambling
trial of a Georgia state senator. The second time he taped
testimony for a federal grand jury that was investigating
allegations that fugitive financier Robert Vesco sought to bribe
members of the Carter administration.
   Reagan was served with the subpoena while he was still
president, along with then-Vice President Bush. Both men sought to
quash the subpoenas.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh argued in a Jan. 13 court
filing that the summonses ``raise profound constitutional concerns
... regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by
a former or sitting president.''
   He added that ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president
being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign
governments in the way they deal with the president now and in the
future.''
   On the day before the North trial started, Gesell ruled the
defendant had not shown that Bush had ``relevant and material''
testimony to give and squashed the subpoena against the new
president.
   But Gesell left the decision on Reagan open. He'll probably make
it this week when the defense starts presentation of its case.

<LEADPARA>  Police and prosecutors' "dream" would have been to see longtime Black Panther

Newton's alleged murderer told jurors Tuesday.;   In a fiery second day of

that police were engaged in a "great, big conspiracy" to frame Robinson for
murder.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'CONSPIRACY' ASSAILED AT NEWTON TRIAL
FIERY ARGUMENTS ARE PRESENTED AT ROBINSON TRIAL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It's ironic because 20 years ago, that's the defense Huey P. Newton used"
when he beat charges that he murdered Oakland police officer John Frey, Burr
said.;   Defense attorney Alfons Wagner accused Oakland police and prosecutors
of "fast and loose playing with witnesses" who escaped criminal charges
themselves while giving investigators statements that Robinson murdered Newton
on a West Oakland street to gain status in the Black Guerrilla Family prison
gang.;   Robinson, 27, an admitted crack dealer who has spent most of his
adult life behind bars, contends he shot Newton three times after Newton fired
at him first.;   Wagner said authorities are seeking a murder conviction
rather than believing Robinson's self defense claim because they don't want
the public to think they are being lenient toward the man responsible for
their nemesis' death.;   In this case, authorities "kiss off anything (pending
against witnesses) because the prosecution was going to look good in the
prosecution of the guy who killed Huey Newton in this town of Oakland," Wagner
told the jury.;   But prosecutor Burr responded that the conspiracy theory was
fanciful and he told the jury he personally resented it.;   "It implies I am
doing something improper, and illegal, and immoral," Burr said.;   Wagner
contends that the prosecution's key witness, Brian Keith Walton, lied in
stating he saw Robinson shoot Newton first while Newton's hands were in the
air and then twice more through the head as he lay on the ground. Walton, a
friend of Robinson's who died last year in an apparently unrelated drug-house
shooting, was facing an auto theft charge at the time he gave his taped
statement to investigators.;   During the trial, Wagner also presented a
string of witnesses to talk about violent incidents in Newton's past,
including the killing of Frey -- in which a manslaughter conviction against
Newton was overturned -- and two other killings in which Newton was
implicated. The evidence was shown to demonstrate a lifelong propensity for
violence in support of Robinson's contention that Newton was armed, even
though police found no gun near Newton's body.;   Burr acknowledged that
Newton was a thorn in the side of local law enforcement for more than two
decades, a radical leader who "had a way of pulling law enforcement's chain, a
way of kind of rubbing law enforcement's noses in it." Most importantly, he
got away with Frey's murder, in the eyes of Frey's fellow Oakland police
officers.;   "What better epitaph could the Oakland Police Department write
than that . . . he's fallen so low he was killed trying to rip off a crack
dealer," Burr said. "That sings.";   But in defending the investigation, Burr
said, the evidence showed Robinson executed a defenseless Newton in the
"stupid" belief he'd "become somebody on the mean streets of West Oakland.";  
Burr is expected to complete his statements to the jury today.  </TEXT>

   A Mississippi businessman was the paid
informant who in 1964 led the FBI to the graves of three slain
civil rights workers, according to records of a defunct
segregationist state agency.
   Olen Burrage of Philadelphia, Miss., received $30,000 from the
FBI for this information,'' records from the Sovereignty Commission
show. The records quote their own informant.
   Burrage, however, denied that he had anything to do with the
killings.
   A federal judge last week ordered the records of the commission,
which tried to thwart civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s,
be opened to the public. The judge later stayed his ruling pending
an appeal.
   Portions of the records are included in the personal papers of
former Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr. The complete records are in the
archives of the McCain Graduate Library at the University of
Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg. Portions were made available
to The Clarion-Ledger in an agreement with the attorney general.
   Burrage told the newspaper Monday that he had nothing to do with
the killings of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
He also denied that the FBI paid him for information.
   Burrage's attorney, Robert Thomas of Philadelphia, said his
client was tried on federal charges of conspiracy to violate the
civil rights of the three men in 1967 and acquitted.
   ``Hey, look, you can write whatever you want to,'' Burrage said
in a telephone interview with the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. ``I
didn't have nothing to do with it. I'm not going to have anything
to do with it now.
   ``I've been harassed for years and years on this mess. I don't
even want to talk to you about it,'' he said.
   Commission investigator A.L. Hopkins' search for the FBI
informant is contained in the commission's records. Hopkins is dead.
   Hopkins wrote a report on his investigation Aug. 6, 1964, two
days after the three bodies were found in a grave at the base of a
pond dam under construction on Burrage's land southwest of
Philadelphia.
   ``I have information from a confidential source ... that Mr.
Olen Burrage, a white male who owns the property where the bodies
were found, and who operates a truck line out of Philadelphia,
Mississippi, is the informant who directed the FBI to the spot,''
Hopkins said in the report.
   Joe Sullivan, who was the FBI agent in charge of the Neshoba
County investigation, said Monday that Burrage never received money
for information.
   ``I didn't pay any money to anybody,'' Sullivan said in an
interview from his New York City home. ``I certainly don't know
anything about it.''
   Sullivan said a freelance writer working on the case during the
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three had
offered a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the bodies.
   ``That was the genesis of all the talk up there,'' Sullivan
said. ``I think he was affluent enough he could have paid the
reward.
   The FBI file shows an informant led agents to the dam, but
Sullivan refused to identify the individual. ``I have never named
anybody, and I don't want to.''
   The commission was created by the Mississippi Legislature on
March 22, 1956, to preserve segregation in the state. The
commission became inactive in 1973 when then-Gov. Bill Waller
vetoed its funding. The Legislature abolished the commission and
ordered its files sealed for 50 years in 1977.

<TEXT>     Mr. Burr was born in Los Angeles and attended public schools there. He
received a horticulture degree in 1927 from the University of California,
Davis, where during the 1920s he reported on sports for the university
newspaper.;    Mr. Burr worked for a nursery in Niles until 1936, when he
moved to Palo Alto. He moved to Portola Valley 15 years ago.;    After
inheriting the roof garden nursery at the Emporium store in San Francisco, he
was approached by an editor for the then San Francisco News, which was located
in the same block. The editor's offer was that Mr. Burr write a weekly garden
column in exchange for a byline containing the name of his business.;    After
Mr. Burr submitted about 80 garden articles, the News merged with the San
Francisco Call Bulletin, owned by William Randolph Hearst, and the garden
column continued, even after Mr. Burr closed his nursery.;    After he
submitted his 287th article, the San Francisco Examiner became an afternoon
newspaper and absorbed the News-Call Bulletin. Mr. Burr was not part of the
deal, so in 1973 he became the Mercury News garden columnist.;    When the
garden section was developed as a weekly special features section in 1976, Mr.
Burr became a contributing writer and later moved into the job of answering
questions submitted by readers.;    Mr. Burr's byline has appeared regularly
in professional publications such as Pacific Horticulture magazine and Pacific
Coast Nurserymen's magazine. He was a longtime member of the Peninsula chapter
of the California Association of Nurserymen and in January was elected an
honorary member of the Garden Writers Association of America.;    Mr. Burr is
survived by his wife of 53 years, Paula, of Portola Valley; a daughter, Jane
Zones of San Francisco; a son, Benjamin Burr of New York; and two grandsons,
Milo Sprague of New York and Isaac Zones of San Francisco.;    No service will
be held. Mr. Burr's cremated remains will be scattered at sea. The family
suggests donations to Strybing Arboretum, 9th Avenue at Lincoln Way, San

<LEADPARA>  Amid all the testimony about Huey P. Newton's violent past, the man accused of
murdering the Black Panther Party leader has "become a forgotten man" at his
own trial, a prosecutor reminded jurors Tuesday.;   Urging the jury to focus
on Tyrone Robinson and find the admitted petty drug dealer guilty of murder,
Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Ken Burr said Robinson's claim of self
defense "does not make sense" given the pattern of three bullet wounds to
Newton's head, delivered "as you would to execute somebody."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEWTON KILLING TRIAL NEARS END
ATTORNEYS PRESENT CLOSING ARGUMENTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Shorter version ran on page 8B of the Morning Final edition  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     'Looking for a way out'; In his closing argument, Burr said Robinson, 27,
is not the bespectacled "yuppie" he appears to be sitting at the defense table
but "an impatient, violent man," tired of the hard life of prison and West
Oakland streets and looking for a way to break out.;   The means to that end
was through killing Newton, a crack-using "has-been" hero of Oakland's black
community who used to get drugs simply by declaring "I'm Huey P. Newton," Burr
said. To Robinson, killing Newton was a way to gain notoriety in the Black
Guerrilla Family, a prison-based gang, and become a decision maker in its drug
sales network, Burr said.;   Says Newton shot first; Robinson has testified
that he shot Newton in the pre-dawn hours on Aug. 22, 1989 after Newton fired
at him first. No gun was found near Newton's body, and Burr contended Robinson
concocted that story as well as a string of run-ins he'd allegedly had with
Newton over the years. Although Robinson said several people witnessed those
past encounters, he couldn't produce any of them to corroborate his story on
the witness stand.;   "He's making them up as he goes along," Burr said.;  
Other than his own testimony, much of Robinson's defense consisted of
statements of law enforcement officials and others regarding violent incidents
in Newton's past in an attempt to lend credibility to the notion Newton was
armed and ready to kill. Jurors heard about Newton's links to three deaths and
four assaults, although only one assault conviction ever was upheld against
him.;   Key witness attacked; In his own closing argument, Robinson's
attorney, Alfons Wagner, attacked the credibility of the prosecution's key
witness, a Robinson friend who testified at a 1989 preliminary hearing but who
was killed last year in a drug shooting police said was unrelated to the
Newton case.;   That witness, Brian Keith Walton, gave investigators taped
statements in which he said he saw Robinson fire the final two shots into
Newton's head as he lay defenseless on the ground. Walton also said Newton was
unarmed and that Robinson told him he killed Newton to earn status in the
Black Guerrilla Family.;   Walton granted immunity; But Wagner said Walton had
much to gain by telling police investigators -- under pressure to find someone
to prosecute for Newton's murder -- a story they wanted to hear. Prosecutors
dropped a pending automobile theft case against Walton and also granted him
immunity from possible charges as an accessory to Newton's killing because he
hid the gun Robinson used.;   "There's been some fast and loose playing with
witnesses in this case," Wagner said. Wagner said county law enforcement
officials, after unsuccessfully pursuing Newton on criminal charges for years,
didn't want to be accused "of letting this one slide by.";   Closing arguments
continue today.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Injured River Guide Says He First Thought Nothing Of Gunfire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALPINE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A river-rafting guide wounded by snipers who
killed one person said he initially thought nothing of the distant
gunfire he heard while taking a couple down the Rio Grande.
   ``That wasn't unusual,'' Jim Burr said of Saturday's attack. ``In
the past, it hasn't been a cause of concern.''
   He said hunters and people ``just shooting'' have used the area
before.
   One of Burr's passengers, Jamie Heffley, also was wounded; Mrs.
Heffley's husband, Michael, was killed while trying to shield her.
   Burr, 36, said Wednesday that even when they were first fired on,
he didn't think the snipers were seriously trying to hit them.
   ``When I got hit I realized they weren't kidding,'' he said.
   Burr, a guide with the Terlingua-based Far Flung Adventures, was
shot in the thigh. He remained hospitalized in Alpine in stable
condition. Mrs. Heffley, of Eastland, was in stable condition in an
Abilene hospital.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities are searching for the snipers, but
have not made any arrests.
   The three were rafting through the Colorado Canyon area when the
snipers opened fire from atop 300-foot bluffs on the Mexican side of
the border.
   ``At the beginning of the incident, after I got shot, I started
hollering at them and running down the river. I'm hollering `There's
no money on the boat. Please don't shoot! No more! No more!''' he
said.
   ``They were hollering something back but in the distance it all
got wadded up. But I think it was Spanish,'' he said.
   ``As far as I can tell, it was totally without motive,'' Burr
said. ``They didn't steal anything. They didn't come down to the
boat.''

   Texas Rangers and Mexican trackers threaded
their way across 400-foot cliffs Monday looking for clues left by
snipers who shot at a Rio Grande rafting party and killed a man
trying to drag his wounded wife to safety.
   Up to four snipers were believed responsible for the Saturday
ambush on the river in which the couple's river guide also was
wounded. He and the woman were hospitalized in stable condition
Monday.
   ``The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the
high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments
later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their
raft,'' said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Public Safety in Austin. ``The woman says it was a nightmare.
   ``There was no provocation or anything. It was just an attack.''
   Cox said it was the second time this year that American tourists
have reported being shot at from the cliffs on Mexico's side of the
Rio Grande.
   Officials believe between 20 and 30 shots were fired, Cox said.
Searchers found 12 shell casings Sunday on the cliffs in an area
reachable only by boat or helicopter and once notorious for its
marijuana cultivation.
   The three were rafting down the river outside Big Bend National
Park in southwestern Texas when they were fired at about noon
Saturday.
   Guide Jim Burr had led Michael W. Heffley and his wife, Jamie, of
Eastland, down two miles of their planned 12-mile trip in the rented
14-foot inflatable raft when the shooting began.
   Mrs. Heffley thought at least two people were on the bluff but
Burr said he saw four, Cox said.
   Burr was shot in the right thigh, but was able to maneuver the
raft ashore. When the gunfire continued, he and the Heffleys moved
downriver. After they pulled ashore again, Mrs. Heffley was shot
when they got out of the raft, authorities said.
   Heffley, 40, was shot in the back and killed while he tried to
help his wife to safety, Cox said.
   Mrs. Heffley and Burr hid in brush, and Burr set out for help
after dark, authorities said. He was spotted by a rancher Sunday
morning.
   When the three failed to arrive at a pickup point Saturday night,
the rafting company sent another raft to look for them. The rescue
crew found the raft and other equipment with numerous bullet holes,
and contacted authorities.
   U.S. Border Patrol and Customs helicopters were sent out early
Sunday and their crews spotted Heffley's body near the river after
daybreak, Cox said. When the helicopters landed, Mrs. Heffley came
out of brush where she had been hiding, he added.
   Steve Harris, co-owner of Far Flung Adventures, said the trio had
started their trip at Rancherias Creek in Presidio County and were
supposed to have gone on to Grassy Bank, a 12-mile trip by river but
40 miles by road.
   The attack occurred in a canyon at a point where the river is 50
to 60 yards wide, he said.
   Heffley was a sales manager for Big State X-Ray, owned by Wade
Penn of Chickasha, Okla. Penn said he and wife, Dolly, were supposed
to join the Heffleys for the trip to Big Bend.
   ``Mike had gone down a couple of weeks ago. He thought it was
such a beautiful area,'' Mrs. Penn said. ``He had taken a motorcycle
trip for a chili cookoff. He thought it was such a pretty area that
he wanted Jamie to see it.''
   Mrs. Heffley, 32, and Burr, 36, were hospitalized in stable
condition in Alpine, 80 miles from the shooting scene.

   A man who threw his wife to safety just as
a sniper's bullet pierced his back during a rafting trip cried, ``My
God! I'm paralyzed,'' then told her ``I love you'' shortly before he
died, the woman said.
   Michael and Jamie Heffley and their guide, Jim Burr, were rafting
on the Rio Grande on Saturday near Big Bend National Park when they
came under a barrage of sniper fire from atop 300-foot bluffs on the
Mexican side of the river.
   ``He threw me out of the line of fire so he took the bullet,''
Mrs. Heffley said Wednesday from the Hendrick Medical Center, where
she was recovering from two gunshot wounds.
   ```My God, I'm paralyzed!''' she recalled him saying. ``And he
said, `I love you.'''
   She said when they were pinned down by the snipers, Heffley asked
her if she was ready to die.
   ``He said, `I'm ready to die,' and asked if I was, and I said
`yes,''' said Mrs. Heffley, of Eastland.
   Mrs. Heffley, 32, was shot in the left side and left shoulder.
Burr, 36, suffered a shotgun wound to the right thigh. Burr also
remained hospitalized.
   Heffley, 40, was killed after one of the snipers shot him in the
back with a .30-30 rifle, police said.
   ``I really consider him to be a hero,'' Burr said. ``He was
shielding her in a very exposed area. He gave up his life for her.''
   U.S. and Mexican authorities have been searching for the
attackers, but have not made any arrests.
   Just before coming under attack, the three noticed a campfire and
heard some gunfire, but did not believe they were in danger. They
came under fire as the raft came into a clearing, Mrs. Heffley said.
   ``We just all looked at each other in horror,'' she said.
   At one point Heffley attempted to reason with their attackers,
yelling offers of money to spare their lives. However, she said,
this only seemed to antagonize them.
   ``There was a period there when I actually sat down and calmly
thought, `This is it. I'm not going to get out of here,''' Burr said.
   ``It's the scaredest I've ever been. It's certainly the closest
I've ever come to dying.''
   After her husband was shot, Mrs. Heffley was all alone. Burr had
left for help and she had to survive the night.
   ``I covered myself in 3 to 4 inches of sod _ anything to
camouflage myself,'' she said. ``I sat in one place for an eternity.
It was cold _ 34 to 35 degrees. I was shaking uncontrollably.
   ``All night long I just prayed to God,'' Mrs. Heffley said. ``If
He kept me alive for this long, somebody was going to save me.''
   She was pulled out by rescuers in helicopters.

<TEXT>
   Five ranch workers were charged Wednesday in
the slayings of more than 40 wild horses and burros, in a continuing
federal investigation into the killings of at least 10 times that
many animals.
   The workers are charged with violating the Wild and Free Roaming
Horse and Burro Act, a misdemeanor punishable by one year in prison
and a fine of $2,000, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Will Mattly.
   A federal grand jury returned indictments Tuesday naming David
Morehead and Shannon Brennan of Lovelock, Eugene John Thacker of
Winnemucca and David Thacker and Ronald Emory Hage of Cosgrave,
Mattly said.
   The indictments were handed up Tuesday, sealed under a judge's
order so the defendants would not know they had been charged until
they were in custody.
   Mattly He said all but Hage were in custody and Hage was expected
to surrender. The four in custody were held under $50,000 bail.
   Morehead is charged with seven counts of killing a wild horse or
burro from May 15 through June 1988 and one count of selling a
mustang and a burro to a livestock yard last February.
   He and Brennan are charged in two other counts with killing 28
wild horses and two wild colts in November 1987; Eugene and David
Thacker and Hage face five counts each for killing five wild horses
in August 1987.
   Mattly said the killings were in Lander and Pershing counties,
where more than 500 mustangs have been found dead since last August.
Most of the animals had been shot.
   Mattly gave no motives for the killings and would not say how the
five men were tracked down except to credit ``an extensive
investigation on the part of the Bureau of Land Management law
enforcement staff.''
   Bureau spokesman Bob Stewart said agents ``have very heavily

   Maxine Shane, public affairs specialist with the BLM, said the

<LEADPARA>  The continuing redevelopment of downtown Campbell, the search for an
acceptable use for the former Winchester Drive-in site, and the establishment
of fire protection service priorities are key issues that will command the
attention of new Mayor Donald R. Burr in the coming year.;   "There are a lot
of issues, but no big problems that I'm aware of," said Burr, Campbell's
police chief for 17 years until his retirement in 1987. "Like all cities,
Campbell is stressed financially and we have to be very select about how we
invest our money."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Of paramount importance, Burr said, will be how the city spends money from
the sale of bonds through the Campbell Redevelopment Agency.;   The city
council has already approved residential development in the downtown intended
not only to provide needed housing, but also to create a population to support
downtown businesses. Burr said the city now needs to attract other developers
to complete the redevelopment master plan.;   The downtown beautification
project, including the return of two-way traffic on East Campbell Avenue, is
set to begin early next year and is an important element in the redevelopment
effort.;   Burr added that while downtown redevelopment is important, the
council is aware "there are other areas in the city that we can't ignore.";  
A top priority for the council will be determining Campbell's future fire
protection needs. The council has ordered a fire protection services master
plan to be completed next year. One of the options to be studied is the
consolidation of the Campbell Fire Department with the county's Central Fire
Protection District, for greater efficiency. Burr said he would support
consolidation if the study overwhelmingly recommends it. "I'm open-minded and
I will rely on the study.";   The mayor also said he favors commercial
development of the Winchester Drive-in site, the largest remaining piece of
undeveloped land in the city. But he also said the recent decision by city
staff to withdraw a development application for the site, in the face of
opposition from many residents and businesses concerned about traffic, was
correct because the issue will require a lot more study.;   Burr, 57, vowed
communication will be the theme of his mayoral tenure and that he will make
himself available to all segments of the community. "People are going to have
questions and I'll be available to talk to any of them," he said.;   Burr
joined the Campbell Police Department in 1956 and served for 31 years, rising
through the ranks from patrolman to chief.;   He won his council seat in 1988,
after the death of longtime Councilman Ralph P. Doetsch Sr.;   Each November,
Campbell's five council members choose a new mayor and vice mayor. Along with
Burr last week, Barbara D. Conant, a teacher at Monroe Middle School in the
Campbell Union School District, was elected vice mayor. Conant is the second
woman in city history to win that post.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Police Arrest Two Suspects in Sniper Attack on Rio Grande Boaters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARFA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have arrested two Mexican teen-agers
and were seeking two others in a sniper attack that killed one
person and wounded two others rafting down the Rio Grande.
   Presidio County Sheriff Rick Thompson said the assailants
apparently began shooting at the victims on a whim.
   ``We have no motive for the shootings,'' he said. ``They saw them
coming down the river and decided to shoot at them.''
   Both suspects gave statements, but Thompson declined to discuss
their statements further.
   Police arrested Eduardo Pineda Rodriguez, 17, on Tuesday at his
parents home near Redford, Thompson said. Rodriguez is a Mexican
citizen but a legal resident of the United States.
   Rodriguez and a 16-year-old boy, whose name was withheld because
of his age, were charged in the Nov. 19 shooting death of Michael
Heffley, 40, of Eastland. They also were suspected of wounding
Heffley's wife, Jamie, 32, and rafting guide, Jim Burr, Thompson
said.
   The 16-year-old was arrested by Chihuahua state judicial police
in Ojinaga, Mexico, Thompson said. Police were seeking two other
teen-age suspects, both of whom were believed to be in Mexico.
   Under international law, a person standing in one country who
fatally shoots a person in another country can be tried in either
nation.
   The attackers opened fire on the trio as they floated on the Rio
Grande through the Colorado Canyon, about 22 miles east of Redford.
   Mrs. Heffley and Burr said their assailants stalked them from a
300-foot-high canyon rim on the Mexican side of the river, which is
about 75 feet wide, as they abandoned their bullet-riddled raft and
scrambled up the river bank.
   Shortly after the attack, Mrs. Heffley recalled that her husband
``threw me out of the line of fire so he took the bullet.''
   Mrs. Heffley was shot in the left side and left shoulder. Burr,
36, suffered a shotgun wound to the right thigh. Heffley was killed
after he was shot in the back with a .30-30 rifle, police said.
   ``I really consider him to be a hero,'' Burr said. ``He was
shielding her in a very exposed area. He gave up his life for her.''
   Mrs. Heffley said she was pleased to hear of the arrests.
   ``I'm glad that they are being caught and I think this incident
should be made a public example,'' she said. ``I think they should
be executed, because if they are not, relations will never get
better across the border. Nobody should have to go through this kind
of torture.''

<LEADPARA>  Huey P. Newton always beat the most serious criminal charges brought against
him, but there was no one to rise to his defense Monday when jurors heard from
witnesses to the two killings he was accused of committing in 1967 and 1974.; 
 As the posthumous trial of Huey Newton continued in the case of the man
accused of murdering him, a prosecutor who spent a good portion of his career
trying to put Newton behind bars also testified that Newton "had gotten away
with what was a very serious crime against society" by avoiding prison in the
1967 killing of Oakland police officer John Frey.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RETIRED COP AND EX-PROSTITUTE REMEMBER NEWTON, THE
KILLER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The defense attorney for Tyrone Robinson, 27, a drug dealer who admitted
shooting Newton on a West Oakland street corner Aug. 22, 1989, is putting
Newton's life on trial to show the late Black Panther Party leader was a
violent man capable of shooting at Robinson first, as Robinson contends. The
prosecution contends Newton was unarmed and Robinson "executed" him.;  
Retired Oakland police officer Herbert Heanes testified about the October 1967
shooting in which both he and Frey were shot in an altercation with Newton.
Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, but the verdict was later
overturned on appeal and two attempts to retry Newton ended in mistrials.
Newton contended he fired in self-defense.;   Also testifying Monday was
Raphaelle Square, a former prostitute who said she was with Kathleen Smith the
night in August 1974 she was shot and killed on San Pablo Avenue.;   Square,
who was then known as Crystal Grey, said she saw Newton get out of a Lincoln
Mark IV and pull out a gun. After running away and returning, she said, she
heard a gunshot and saw Newton "standing over" Smith and "laughing at me" as
Square tried to reach her fallen friend.;   Newton fled to Cuba after Smith
was killed, but he returned to face the murder charge in 1977. Two trials in
the case ended in hung juries after Newton denied being at the scene.;   Tom
Orloff, who prosecuted Newton in the Smith case and now is Alameda County's
second-ranking prosecutor, testified that Newton "on occasion . . . was a very
violent person.";   Ken Burr, the deputy district attorney prosecuting
Robinson, did not cross-examine either Square or Heanes.;   From his boss,
Orloff, Burr elicited testimony that an Oakland journalist who testified last
week that Newton once admitted killing Smith never took that information to
authorities. Burr is attempting to discredit the journalist's testimony, even
though Orloff and other fellow prosecutors believe Newton committed the
crime.;   At a hearing with the jury out of the courtroom last week, Superior
Court Judge Alfred A. Delucchi expressed his concern that all the testimony
about Newton's past amounted to "trashing the victim" in order to give the
jury the impression that Newton "was such a bad guy he deserved to die.";  
But Burr said the defense had a right to present such evidence and did not
object to the testimony being presented. The defense expects to rest its case
today.  </TEXT>

   The Trouble With Veeps

   Though presidential-primary results have yet to register,
it's a sure bet that politicians are already scheming and
cajoling behind the scenes in the hopes of landing the No. 2
spot on the 1992 ticket -- the Republican one, too. This
alone shows how far the much-maligned vice presidency has
come since Daniel Webster, in spurning the Whig nomination in
1848, explained: "I do not propose to be buried until I am
dead."
   Following John C. Calhoun, who was elected the seventh
vice president in 1825, no vice president was nominated to a
second term by a party convention until James S. Sherman, in
1912. As syndicated columnist Jules Witcover puts it in
"Crapshoot: Rolling the Dice on the Vice Presidency" (Crown,
450 pages, $25), through most of our history, the office was
a "certifiable dead end."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judging by the dreadful bill of particulars Mr. Witcover
has assembled, this was a good thing. The overwhelming
majority of U.S. veeps have been dim, crooked, lowly and
loutish. Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, was indicted
for murder and tried for treason. Both of Ulysses S. Grant's
running mates, Schuyler Colfax and Henry Wilson, were
implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandal. Calvin Coolidge
was counting on his veep, Charles Dawes, to break a tie in a
crucial Senate vote -- but Dawes slept through it.
   Herbert Hoover's No. 2, Charles Curtis, was nicknamed
"Egg" for his wheeling and dealing for the poultry industry.
Under Franklin Roosevelt, the pro-Soviet Henry Wallace liked
to denounce American businessmen as "midget Hitlers." In a
delicious bit of foreshadowing, the New York Times once said
of Woodrow Wilson's vice president, Indiana Gov. Thomas
Marshall, "If Indiana cannot raise men of presidential
caliber, she should at least try to train them to keep
silence when they have not the mental equipment to fit them
for an understanding of what is required."
   But dating from the tenure of Harry Truman, a scorned vice
president who turned out to be a heroic Cold War leader, the
vice presidency itself has been no joke (the current occupant
notwithstanding). Five of the past nine presidents had first
served as vice presidents, and in six of the past seven
national elections both nominees had first been presidential
understudies. Three -- Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford
-- rose to the top spot following presidential death or
disgrace.
   The enhanced chance of today's vice president becoming
tomorrow's president has Mr. Witcover worried. He sees danger
in the slipshod selection process and the indifference of the
electorate.
   The fact is that advances in medicine and security make
the odds of a president dying or being killed in office
slimmer today than in 1850. As for the vice presidency's
giving candidates a leg up in the race for the presidency,
this is due to television exposure and the ability to raise
money. In other words, it is due to politics; Mr. Witcover
writes as though vice presidents ascend through black magic.
   Still, it is deplorable that presidential candidates
continue to select running mates with little regard for their
worthiness as successors: John F. Kennedy, for instance,
tapped Johnson because he wanted Mike Mansfield to be Senate
majority leader rather than the treacherous LBJ. Richard
Nixon chose candidates who wouldn't outshine him, Spiro Agnew
and Mr. Ford. George McGovern, turned down by his first two
choices and unable to reach the third on the telephone,
picked the eventually discredited Sen. Thomas Eagleton on a
lark, thus ensuring that background checks would be part of
all future selections.
   George Bush was no different from the pack in his choice
of Dan Quayle. But Mr. Witcover's partisanship keeps him from
recognizing this, as he insists against his own evidence that
Mr. Quayle is uniquely unfit for higher office. He gives us
surely the most exhaustive list of Mr. Quayle's gaffes in
print, but his portrait of the man is cursory and flat, and
he has almost nothing to say about Mr. Quayle's substantive
record in the vice presidency, which is more impressive than
most of his predecessors'. (Even the Washington Post has
recognized this, leaving Mr. Witcover trailing behind the
Beltway's sluggish conventional wisdom.)
   One does not have to be a fan of Mr. Quayle's to see that
Mr. Witcover's huffing and puffing comes down to this: "What
if Quayle, feeling his oats and prodded by his right-wing
constituency, brought in more doctrinaire conservatives to
restore the Reagan Revolution they feel was abandoned by
Bush?" Personally, I think it would be pretty wonderful.
   The author is angry that the voters didn't punish Mr. Bush
for his choice. But for better or worse, vice presidents have
hardly ever made a difference one way or the other on
Election Day. To remedy this, Mr. Witcover wants to rob
voters of their right not to care. A new president would
submit his or her vice presidential nominee to Congress for
confirmation after the election, thereby eliminating
"blatantly political considerations" now impinging on the
choice. The idea that Congress could make a decision free of
partisan politics, much less of character assassination, is
one that could only be held by a liberal Washington
columnist.

PROSECUTOR QUOTES SOME OF PANTHER'S LAST WORDS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Shorter version ran P. 2B Morning Final Edition  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Robinson's attorney, Alfons Wagner, said his client will not deny shooting
Newton but will testify he did it after Newton fired a shot at him. No gun was
found near Newton.;   The first-degree murder trial promises, in part, to
relive the days of Newton and the Black Panthers, as Wagner said he will
support his defense by showing that Newton had a history of violence.;  
"Whatever else Huey Newton might have been, he was a violent, violent man,"
Wagner told the six-man, six-woman jury.;   The audience at opening statements
in the trial Monday in Alameda County Superior Court included former Black
Panther Party leaders David Hilliard and John Seale, and Newton's widow,
Fredrika.;   Hilliard, the party's former chief of staff, said outside the
courtroom that he found it "pretty strange" to hear an Alameda County district
attorney's representative run through the litany of community programs the
party sponsored after that same prosecutor's office spent years trying to put
Newton and other party members behind bars.;   He also said he didn't know
Newton, who once walked into the state Capitol with a rifle, to carry a gun in
the 1980s.;   "We put down the guns for three-piece suits and briefcases a
long time ago," Hilliard said.;   The prosecution and defense agree that
Newton, 47, was "tweaked," or high, on crack cocaine and looking for more
drugs on the morning he died. And both sides agree that Robinson, 27, was a
petty cocaine seller on the streets of West Oakland.;   Prosecutor Burr argued
that Robinson "executed" Newton, shooting him once in the jaw and twice
through the brain at close range as he lay on the ground, to gain prominence
in the Black Guerrilla Family prison gang.;   Robinson "wanted to be somebody
in the mean streets of West Oakland, and Huey Newton's death provided him with
that ticket," Burr said.;   Moments before shooting Newton, Robinson told a
friend on the street, "I'm going to kill (Newton), gonna get me some stripes,"
Burr said. And shortly after the shooting, according to the prosecutor,
Robinson boasted to other friends that "I'm going to be in control and you
guys are going to have to do what I tell you because I'm going to be
controlling the streets.";   Robinson's version, which he will give as the
first defense witness, will be substantially different, Wagner promised.;  
Robinson will talk about his recollections as a child of Black Panther
Party-sponsored breakfasts, of an uncle who helped deliver clothing for the
party, and how his parents told him "about Huey Newton killing a cop" -- a
charge on which Newton was convicted but which was later overturned.;  
Robinson also will say he had several run-ins with Newton before the shooting,
Wagner said, including one in which Newton shot at him as Robinson passed in a
car, and another confrontation in which Newton "took off" Robinson by stealing
crack cocaine from him at gunpoint.;   Although police never found a gun at
the scene, Wagner said there was gunshot residue evidence on Newton's arms,
indicating he had recently fired a weapon.;   In addition to their perceptions
of Huey Newton, jurors will have to consider the credibility of another dead
man -- Brian Walton, the only witness to the shooting. Walton, an associate of
both Newton's and Robinson's, died last year but left behind a series of
conflicting statements about what he saw. Much of the prosecution's case is
built around Walton's taped statements, which he seemed to recant at times and
support at times at a preliminary hearing in 1989.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in Handicapped Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today told a lower court to
consider freeing New York officials from having to continue an
educational program for a blind, severely retarded man after he
turns 22.
   The justices set aside a ruling that required continued state
support, and told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling in
light of their June 15 decision in a Pennsylvania case.
   That decision shields states from federal court lawsuits seeking
to enforce a federal law to help handicapped children.
   The New York case involves Clifford Burr of New York City who
turned 21 on Dec. 30. Burr attended, at public expense, a private
school for blind and retarded youngsters until he was 16.
   New York officials helped pay the cost under the federal
Education of the Handicapped Act, which requires an appropriate free
public education for handicapped individuals up to age 22.
   When the private school closed in 1984, Burr was referred to a
state-supported school, the New York Institute for the Education of
the Blind.
   That school refused to accept him, saying he needed training in
``life skills'' and was too retarded to have any academic potential.
   A state Department of Education hearing officer ruled 18 months
after the private school closed that Burr should be admitted. The
institute appealed to the state commissioner of education, who
upheld the decision three months later.
   Burr was allowed to attend the institute's program for those with
multiple handicaps.
   Kenneth and Betty Burr sued in an attempt to win compensation for
the two years their son was out of school while the case was
reviewed.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in December that
federal regulations requiring prompt consideration of such cases
were ``grossly violated.''
   ``It is true that a handicapped child does not have a right to
demand public education beyond the age of 21,'' the appeals court
said.
   ``Nevertheless, we believe that Clifford is entitled to a remedy
for a deprivation of the right that the (federal) statute clearly
provided him _ a free appropriate education between the ages of 3
and 21.''
   The case is Sobol vs. Burr, 88-1493.

NEWSWIRE: SEAHAWKS' BURSE FAILS DRUG TEST, OUT 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second-year fullback Tony Burse, trying to earn a spot on the Seattle Seahawks 
roster, was suspended for 30 days by the National Football League for violating 
the league's substance abuse policy, the NFL said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were notified by the league Friday that Burse, who will not be 
allowed to practice with the team until Sept. 6, had tested positive for drugs 
in the NFL's mandatory preseason test. It was not known what substance was 
found in the test. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Knox refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma said the league told the Seahawks that Burse 
was a "Step Two" violator, meaning it was the second time he had failed a test 
since NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle implemented his drug plan last year. A 
30-day suspension is mandatory for second-time violators. 
</P>
<P>
If Burse failed a third test, he would be banned from football for an 
indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
Burse failed one test during training camp last year. 
</P>
<P>
Burse, 24, has not practiced with the Seahawks since suffering an ankle injury 
during practice Tuesday. He did not play in the team's 16-10 overtime victory 
over Phoenix in Tempe, Ariz., Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 220-pound Burse, from Middle Tennessee State, was a 12th-round 
draft pick of the Seahawks in 1987. He made Seattle's roster for the 1987 
season and played in 12 games, mainly on special teams, but was cut during the 
1988 exhibition season. He also tested positive for drugs for the first time 
during that period.

   One or more sharpshooters killed 51 of the animals recently,
about one-third of a herd in a remote area 15 miles southwest of
here in northwestern Arizona. Their bodies were found during the
week of April 16-20.
   Investigators said most were killed by a shot to the head, with
small-caliber rifles fired from 100 to 300 yards away.
   ``It was done by a professional, there is no doubt,'' said Karen
Sussman, president of the International Society for the Protection
of Mustangs and Burros. ``The shooting was indiscriminate _ they
shot mares about to give birth, young foals, adult burros, all of
them.''
   Her organization is offering $5,000 for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the killers.
   Burros are not native to North America but are descended from
pack animals abandoned or lost by miners. Critics say they compete
with both native species and livestock for space, water and food.
Wildlife advocates have criticized their effects on endangered
species such as the desert tortoise.
   Until 1971, feral burros and horses were routinely killed by
ranchers and hunters. Then a public outcry resulted in the Wild and
Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.
   They were declared ``living symbols of the historic and pioneer
spirit of the West'' and placed under federal protection. Penalties
for killing them range as high as a $2,000 fine and a year in jail
per burro killed.
   Ranchers' perspectives on the issue were illustrated by a letter
which the Mohave Daily Miner published Friday from Jennifer
Chambers.
   ``I do not condone the recent method of elimination of the
burro, but I can understand the reasoning behind the action,'' she
wrote.
   ``Burros can be mean, kicking and biting ... (and) are also very
destructive, especially with water sources which in this area are
vital to the lives of wild animals in the desert. Burros will
trample a water hole into a muddy mess and, to put it politely,
relieve themselves, thus rendering the water unfit ... to drink.''
   Ms. Chambers suggested that the environmentalists arrange with
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set aside tracts of land for
burros.
   Ms. Sussman ``and her group could pay to feed the burros and
arrange adoptions and save taxpayer funds,'' added Ms. Chambers,
who did not return calls seeking further comment.
   A motive for the killings was unclear.
   ``There has been controversy, some threats against the burros
from different interests up in that area,'' said Anna Maria Adamo,
a BLM spokeswoman in Phoenix.
   ``But we have carefully controlled the burro herds in this area,
so there would be no conflict with wildlife. And there is no cattle
grazing at all in that area now, so we have no cause to think the
problem is rancher-related,'' she added.
   Officials have estimated there were about 150 burros in the
immediate area of the killings and an additional 450 in the Black
Mountains. Some hang around the old mining town of Oatman, where
tourists feed them.
   Sources said the carcasses were scattered over an
eight-square-mile area of almost inaccessible terrain.
   ``Given that this area was so remote and that such a large
number of animals was killed, whoever went out there really was
determined to decimate the herd,'' Ms. Adamo said.
   ``This was not just someone off on a lark, sport killing,'' Ms.
Adamo added. ``You know: `I can't find a rabbit to shoot, so I'll
shoot a burro.' This was someone who put a great deal of effort
into getting those animals.''

<HEAD>Striking UAW Local Rejects Chrysler Contract For Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FENTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking United Auto Workers at a Chrysler
Corp. assembly plant on Wednesday narrowly rejected a new contract,
a week after walking off their jobs, a union official said.
   George Burr, president of UAW Local 110, said the three-year
agreement was rejected by 41 votes, with 1,197 members voting
against it and 1,156 voting for it.
   The suburban St. Louis plant is the only one producing the
long-wheelbase minivan, said Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard.
   It was the second vote on the contract, which was worked out
last Friday, two days after some 3,200 union members walked off
their jobs when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline.
   In a vote Sunday, the contract was rejected by 61 percent of the
union's rank-and-file amid reports of illegal balloting.
   Burr said he thought the contract was rejected Wednesday because
of union members' concerns about outside contracting and
``outsourcing,'' the practice of shipping out work from the plant
to lower-paid workers.
   Those issues were taken away from Local 110 bargainers by the
international UAW, Burr said.
   The vote ``sends a message that the primary concern of the
people on the line and in the plant lies in the outsourcing and
outside contracting arena,'' Burr said. ``We recognize that this is
a problem.''
   Burr said the local leadership would be meeting Thursday and
would be in contact with the union's national leadership.
   Anthony P. St. John, vice president for human resources at
Chrysler Motors, said the company was ``deeply disappointed'' by
the vote because the local union bargaining committee, as well as
UAW Region 5 and the international union, had approved the
agreement last Friday.
   ``The result is that the St. Louis plant employees continue to
lose wages, several hundred employees elsewhere at Chrysler will
remain on layoff, and the corporate-wide profit sharing program for
all employees is affected adversely, as is Chrysler's loss of
revenue resulting from the strike,'' St. John said.
   ``We are considering the options available to us in this no-win
situation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airline Buccaneer Donald Burr: People Express Founder Ready to Make
A Move</HEAD>

   Donald C. Burr built one of the biggest airlines
from scratch using ultra-cheap fares to draw millions of customers,
only to see his empire collapse six years later. Now he could be
ready to make a comeback.
   Burr, 47, founder of defunct People Express Airlines, has
started to talk to the press after two years of shunning public
view. He has re-emerged at a time when Eastern Airlines, paralyzed
by a strike and in bankruptcy protection from creditors, is
tottering on extinction.
   Could Burr be putting himself forward as a ``white knight''
manager to help rescue Eastern, or gearing up to start a new
airline to replace it? He's dodging the question, but
circumstantial evidence indicates the answer is yes.
   Burr's formal agreement not to compete against former boss Frank
Lorenzo has just effectively expired. Lorenzo, steely chairman of
Texas Air Corp. which controls Eastern, bought a battered People
Express from Burr in September 1986 for $300 million.
   At its zenith in 1985, Newark, N.J.-based People Express was a
wildly successful product of airline deregulation, offering
discount fares to 150 cities and pulling in more than $1 billion a
year in revenue.
   ``I'm trying to find a way to reinvent the (airline) product
again,'' Burr said in an interview.
   Besides lecturing at universities and writing a book about
People Express during the past two years, Burr said he has
informally looked at a few potential new airline deals.
   Industry sources say he spoke with Lorenzo before the Eastern
strike about the possibility of running the carrier. Burr would
only say that he's had ``conceptual'' talks with the Texas Air
chief. Lorenzo has refused to comment.
   What if the rebellious unions at Miami-based Eastern approached
him to help take over or run the airline? ``I'd have to consider
it,'' he said.
   Burr talks with evangelical enthusiasm about the airline
industry, whether he's reminiscing about triumphs and travails of
People Express or looking forward to the next chapter of
deregulation. It's a talent he's honed on the lecture circuit,
where he commands $10,000 a speech.
   ``The airlines are on the verge of unprecedented
profitability,'' he said, perched on the edge of a chair at the
Harvard Club in midtown Manhattan. ``I would love to see the
airline industry evolve toward high-commitment service
organizations.''
   Burr's career path, and life, have been closely intertwined with
Lorenzo's __ he even served as best man at Lorenzo's wedding in
1972. They are only a year apart in age and were both born in May
under the sign of Taurus, the bull. Yet their personalities seem
poles apart.
   With his boyish good looks and disarming ebullience, Burr is a
study in contrasts with the gaunt, fierce-looking Lorenzo, who has
become a leading target of organized labor because of his avowed
anti-union strategies.
   Burr, born in suburban South Windsor, Conn., has been described
by people in the industry as a preppie entrepreneur. Lorenzo, 48,
grew up in tough, street-wise Queens, N.Y.
   People familiar with the two personalities find it difficult to
imagine Burr working for Lorenzo, which he did twice, and fencing
with him in one of the most brutally competitive businesses of the
1980s.
   They both attended Harvard Business School, where Lorenzo got
his MBA in 1963 and Burr received his in 1965. Burr then went to
work as a financial analyst for National Aviation Corp., a New York
investment company, while Lorenzo was an analyst for Trans World
Airlines Inc. and later for Eastern.
   Burr was elected president of National Aviation in 1971 _ two
years after Lorenzo created Jet Capital Corp., the aircraft leasing
company that was to become the core of Texas Air. In 1973, after
Lorenzo acquired ailing Texas International Airlines, he recruited
Burr, whose National Aviation had been an investor in Lorenzo's
takeover.
   Burr became president of Texas International, where he helped
Chairman Lorenzo introduce discount ``Peanut Fares'' that
revolutionized the industry and made the airline the
fastest-growing U.S. carrier.
   In January 1980, Burr left Texas International to take advantage
of the 1978 deregulation of the industry that let airlines set
their own fares and fly where they wished.
   He started his own low-cost airline, People Express, which
created an enormous new market of air travelers with a
pay-on-board, lug-your-own bags approach that made his planes the
Greyhound buses of the sky.
   After a quick takeoff and supersonic growth, People Express
eventually crashed as big competitors undercut Burr's discount
fares to prevent him from taking away their customers. After it was
sold to what was now Texas Air in September 1986, Burr went back to
work for Lorenzo, but not for long.
   He is careful not to join the Lorenzo-bashing that has become so
popular. The strongest thing Burr will say about Lorenzo is he's a
``low-cost warhound.''
   Burr says he's too busy thinking about what he calls
``reinventing the product'' to dwell on the past. But as for
whether he's preparing to fill a void created if Eastern
disappears, Burr is evasive.
   ``I'm after the same thing I've been after my whole lifetime,''
he said.

   A businessman was the informant who led
FBI agents in 1964 to the graves of three slain civil rights
workers in Philadelphia, Miss., according to files of the state's
old segregation agency.
   The files naming Olen Burrage were obtained by The
Clarion-Ledger. Its account Tuesday represented the first time the
tipster who purportedly led agents to the bodies in an earthen dam
has been publicly identified.
   Burrage on Monday denied any connection with the killings of
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner and denied being
an FBI informant.
   ``I didn't have nothing to do with it,'' Burrage told the
Clarion-Ledger. ``I'm not going to have anything to do with it now.
   The state never charged anyone with the murders, which have
become the focus of renewed attention since being dramatized in the
movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' Several men were convicted of civil
rights violations in the case.
   The 1964 report to Mississippi's now-defunct Sovereignty
Commission said Burrage, on whose land the bodies were found, was
paid $30,000 by the FBI to reveal the location of the graves. The
report was prepared by commission investigator A.L. Hopkins, who
has since died, and quotes an anonymous informant.
   Joe Sullivan, who was the FBI agent in charge of the
investigation, refused to identify the informant who FBI files said
led agents to the bodies. He added in an interview from his New
York City home, ``I didn't pay any money to anybody.''
   Sullivan said a free-lance writer working on the case during the
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three civil
rights workers had offered a reward of $25,000 for information
leading to the bodies.
   The commission, created in 1956 to preserve segregation, became
inactive in 1973 and was disbanded in 1977.
   The Legislature ordered its files sealed for 50 years. U.S.
District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. on Thursday ordered the files
opened to the public, but Barbour stayed his own order pending an
appeal.
   The newspaper said it obtained the report from the personal
papers of the late Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr.
   Documents that have leaked from the files over the years show
the agency routinely kept files on civil rights activists and
individuals friendly with them.

Gladys Burr, 82, who spent 42 years in state institutions after being 
mistakenly labeled as mentally retarded. Miss Burr was 29 in 1936 when family 
members had her committed to Norwich State Hospital in Connecticut because of 
what they said were emotional outbursts. Miss Burr stayed there for 42 years 
despite IQ tests that proved her of normal intelligence. In 1978 an attorney, 
Richard Altshuler, wrote the state Department of Mental Retardation to ask why 
she had been kept institutionalized. A few days after he sent the letter, Miss 
Burr was released. She won a $235,000 settlement from the state in 1985. In

<TEXT>     The testimony will be part of Robinson's efforts to convince jurors that
Newton fired first when Robinson killed him on a West Oakland street Aug. 22,
1989. No gun was found near Newton, and Deputy District Attorney Ken Burr
contends Robinson "executed" Newton.;   Burr, whose colleagues long sought to
put Newton behind bars but were often frustrated in those attempts, agreed
that testimony about Newton's past is fair game. With the jury out of the
courtroom, Burr even persuaded Judge Alfred A. Delucchi to allow testimony
about Newton's 1964 conviction in a knife attack after the judge had said he
wouldn't allow it. It was the only conviction of Newton for a violent act that
was never overturned.;   "Yes, that type of stuff hurts (the prosecution
case)," Burr said, "but at the same time, (Wagner) has got a point.";   In
coming days, the jury will hear Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer talk
about arresting the then 16-year-old Newton in 1958 for hitting someone with a
hammer. Plummer was then a Berkeley police officer.;   Also now scheduled to
testify will be an officer who witnessed the 1967 shooting of an Oakland
police officer, a case that resulted in a manslaughter conviction for Newton
that later was overturned. And Tom Orloff, Alameda County's second-ranking
prosecutor who described Newton as a "gangster" after his death, will be
called to talk about Newton's reputation.;   In testimony Tuesday, jurors
heard from an Oakland man who described an all-night crack cocaine binge with
Newton before Newton was shot. Willie Payne Jr. described how Newton would run
out of crack, head to the streets and show up again with another collection of
"rocks" to smoke.;   He also testified that Newton said he was going to "take
some dope" -- meaning steal -- from Robinson when he headed out of Payne's
house near the shooting scene for the last time.;   Payne said he didn't see
whether Newton had a gun, but Newton had talked about killing people who were
rumored to be looking for him for allegedly ripping off drug dealers.  </TEXT>

   At least two snipers, firing
from Mexican cliffs along the Rio Grande, opened fire on three
rafters, killing one and wounding the other two, authorities said
Sunday.
   The river guide walked through thick brush after Saturday's
attack in southwestern Texas, and was seen by a farmer when he
reached a highway on Sunday morning. A woman who was shot hid in
brush overnight.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities flew over the area in a helicopter
and spotted the dead man's body on the riverbank, said Mike Cox, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin.
   Cox said it was the second time this year that American tourists
in the area have reported being shot at from Mexican bluffs.
   Between 20 and 30 shots were fired, Cox said, adding that the
area where shell casings were found was remote and reachable only by
boat or helicopter and was once notorious for its marijuana
cultivation.
   The casings were 30-30 caliber, which are used in rifles;
.44-caliber Magnum; and .22-caliber, Cox said.
   ``The woman says it was a nightmare,'' Cox said. ``There was no
provocation or anything. It was just an attack. They were just a
married couple who were tourists in the area. The woman believed
that two people were on the bluff. The guide said he saw four.
   ``They were in an area of high bluffs on the river,'' Cox said.
``The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the
high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments
later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their
raft.''
   Guide Jim Burr, 36, had led the raft about two miles downriver
from a remote camp area when the shooting began about noon Saturday.
   ``They were in what is known as Colorado Canyon on the American
side of the river in an area about 30 miles east of Presidio,'' Cox
said.
   Burr was shot first, in the right thigh, but managed to get the
raft to shore, where all three got out, Cox said.
   The snipers continued shooting, and the three got back into the
raft and went farther downstream, Cox said.
   ``He (Burr) thought he could get to a better point of safety, so
they got back in the raft and hugging closely on the shore
(continued) to get on down the river,'' Cox said.
   As the shots continued, the trio pulled ashore again to seek
shelter in the brush. As they were getting out of the raft, Jamie
Heffley was shot in the left side and left shoulder, Cox said. Her
husband, Michael W. Heffley, 40, was trying to help her to safety
when he was shot in the back and killed, Cox said. The injured were
taken to Brewster Memorial Hospital in Alpine, about 80 miles from
the national park, where night supervisor Joyce Rutledge said late
Sunday they were in stable condition.
   U.S. and Mexican officials were working together to find the
snipers.
   The Heffleys were from Eastland, about 60 miles east of Abilene,
Cox said.

<HEAD>Burr: Eastern Crisis Raises Specter of Re-Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of now-defunct People Express
Airlines says the labor crisis gripping Eastern Airlines has raised
the prospect that the government will try to re-regulate the airline
industry that it opened up a decade ago _ a task he says the
government is ill-equipped to handle.
   Donald C. Burr, the founder of People Express and former employee
of Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, says the government
already is failing to oversee the industry adequately and would be
unable to do so if it again re-imposed stiff regulations on fares.
   Eastern has been virtually grounded by a two-week-old strike by
its Machinists union, which has been supported by most of the
airline's pilots and flight attendants. The near shutdown of its
operations forced the carrier to file for bankruptcy protection from
creditors on March 9.
   The possible disappearance of Eastern from the skies and the
temptation for its rivals to hike fares has given rise to public
debate about competition within the industry _ and, Burr said in an
interview Thursday, has raised the prospect of re-regulation.
   The federal government deregulated fare competition in the
airline industry in 1978, giving rise to cut-rate carriers such as
People Express.
   Burr, 47, a graduate of Harvard Business School, has placed
himself in the public eye again after about two years of shunning
the press and the spotlight. That fueled speculation he could be
putting himself forward as a possible participant in an Eastern
buyout.
   Burr said he would ``have to consider it'' if the Eastern unions
approached him about leading a buyout, but he stressed that is not
his primary intention.
   ``I've been president of three companies; I've already done
that,'' he said. ``I'm after the same things I've been after my
whole lifetime ... I would love to see the airline industry evolve
toward high-commitment service organizations.''
   Burr said he has talked about broad concepts with Lorenzo from
time to time before the Eastern strike that started March 4.
   Despite Eastern's travails, deregulation on the whole has been
``a stunning success'' that has opened air travel to more Americans,
Burr said. ``It freed the industry to be marketplace-oriented.''
   Burr quit his job as president of Texas International, Texas
Air's predecessor, in January 1980 to start up no-frills People
Express.
   Spurred by the removal of federal restrictions on fares, the
discount carrier quickly grew, by Burr's reckoning, into the world's
fifth-largest airline with revenue of about $2 billion at its peak
in the summer of 1985.
   People Express eventually was defeated by competitors who were
able to match and undercut its fares _ in addition to offering
full-fare services _ and to offer their own powerful computer
reservations systems, said Burr, who sold People Express to Texas
Air for $300 million in September 1986.
   His faith in deregulation undaunted by the experience, Burr
points to Lorenzo as the current ``low-cost warhound.''
   If Lorenzo's Eastern and sister carrier Continental Airlines
fail, ``we would lose the last major low-cost product,'' Burr warned.
   That event also could open the field to a new low-cost carrier _
which some observers say Burr might be inclined to start up.
   He currently is writing a book on People Express and lectures at
several universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina. He
says he also has looked at possible new airline deals from time to
time.

So, what does a guy do while he's sitting around waiting to be voted into 
baseball's Hall of Fame? Well, if that person is 311-game winner Tom Seaver, he 
might try his hand at writing whodunits. 
</P>
<P>
This would seem to be an unlikely career change for most athletes, but Seaver's 
been successful in many ventures, and he is a personable, informed and 
well-traveled gentleman. That he should take up the novelist's pen, as he has 
the broadcaster's mike, is no great shock. In fact, he's already written a few 
nonfiction books, including "The Art of Pitching" and "How I Would Pitch to 
Babe Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Beanball" co-author Herb Resnicow must be quite a salesman. Not only 
did he convince the great right-hander -- a former member of the Mets, Reds, 
White Sox and Red Sox -- to join him on the mystery train but, in 1986, he also 
managed to talk Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton into adding his name to 
"Murder at the Super Bowl" (PaperJacks: $3.95). He also wrote "The World Cup 
Murder" with soccer great Pele. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to report that Tom Terrific's mystery is as masterful as his 
pitching, but, alas, it isn't. This has less to do with Seaver's literary 
prowess, however, than it does with Resnicow's peculiar sense of how things get 
done in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
In his first such effort, "Murder at the Super Bowl," it wasn't easy to tell 
exactly where Tarkenton's input ended and Resnicow's began. "Beanball" makes it 
clear where that line is drawn because the books are practically identical: 
same plot, same suspects, same goofy characters, same dilemmas. The difference 
is the sport and the victims: Fran killed off a football coach, Tom ices a 
baseball owner. 
</P>
<P>
The Resnicow formula sets forth that a professional sports team based in 
Brooklyn has just captured its division's championship and, against all odds, 
is pitted against a heavily favored competitor for the overall league 
championship. Sometime before that game, however, an important member of the 
Brooklyn squad is killed. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Marcus Aurelius Burr, an excruciatingly yuppified sportswriter who really 
wants to become an investigative reporter ("Uncover one major scandal and your 
fortune's made. Books, movies, TV.") Burr always manages to stumble upon the 
murder victim hours before anyone else and, like a true "Front Page" 
journalist, calls his editor before he alerts the police -- which hardly 
endears him to the homicide boys downtown. Seaver's and Tarkenton's input seems 
to come chiefly in providing sports color and inventing game strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not Travis McGee, but so far, so good. The problem -- and it's a 
huge one -- comes in the fact that Resnicow hasn't the foggiest notion how a 
real newspaper is run, especially as it pertains to the relationship between 
reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
In both books, Burr and his crusty old sports editor gnaw on each other about a 
dozen different things, which isn't all that unusual. What is peculiar, 
however, is that an editor would allow his reporter -- who also triples as a 
columnist, copy editor and photographer -- to become the chief investigator for 
the police and then use his column space to provoke the killer into revealing 
himself. Maybe in Mayberry, R.F.D., but not in New York. 
</P>
<P>
It also doesn't help that, in two books, columnist Burr hasn't written a 
paragraph that is remotely interesting to read. Jim Murray he ain't. 
</P>
<P>
In "Beanball," the George Steinbrenner-like owner of the Brooklyn Bandits is 
killed by a 90-mile-per-hour fastball thrown at him while he is walking in a 
dark tunnel in his stadium. The suspects include the opposing World Series 
managers, a coach, a trainer, a couple of players and Burr himself. 
</P>
<P>
When Burr isn't busy playing detective, he must -- get this -- write a daily 
column, scribble additional sidebars, edit a women's sports section, take 
photographs, defend himself against a sex-discrimination lawsuit, avoid hurled 
hardballs, practice gymnastics and keep his longtime girlfriend from throwing 
him out of their loft. Whew! I guess this explains how only Clark Kent could be 
Superman and a reporter at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness the three-time Cy Young Award-winning Seaver was around to 
construct an entertaining World Series battle to distract the reader from all 
the other silliness. The games and players themselves are interesting, and the 
situations -- while highly unlikely -- are resolved with credibility and humor. 
Tarkenton similarly served Resnicow in "Murder at the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite blunder in "Beanball" occurs every time Resnicow mentions that the 
Brooklyn "side of the stadium went wild." If pressed, I'm sure Seaver would 
have told him that, in baseball, unlike high school football, a team's fans 
occupy the whole stadium, with a handful of seats set aside for the opponent's 
wives and executives. 
</P>
<P>
A small point, perhaps, but -- compounded by two dozen other, similar groaners 
-- this annoyance made me want to throw the book on the ground and hit it with 
a Louisville Slugger.

BURNED BY BURR

<TEXT>
<P>
Perry Mason turned up once again with one of his plodding two-hour vehicles on 
March 11. If you're a fan of Raymond Burr, you could describe his acting as 
laid back and underplayed. 
</P>
<P>
If not, you could call it stilted, ponderous and boring. Whatever, "The Case of 
the Desperate Deception," which was filmed in Paris, seemed carelessly done. If 
Burr comes to life at all in this series of movies, it is usually during the 
trial scene. This time out, he couldn't manage that. Mason's secretary, Della, 
seemed uncaring about her few telephone scenes. And William Moses is no 
substitute for William Katt, who had pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Gargantuan gaffe of the film was Burr's line (misread, perhaps?): "The 
court-martial begins tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the morning." Can anyone recall 
when 10 a.m. came in the afternoon?

   Today is Friday, September 1, the 244th day of 1989. There are
121 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on September 1, 1939, World War II began as Nazi
Germany invaded Poland. Great Britain and France declared war
against Germany two days later.
   On this date:
   In 1807, former Vice President Aaron Burr was found innocent of
treason.
   In 1878, Emma M. Nutt became the first woman telephone operator
in the United States, for the Telephone Despatch Company of Boston.
   In 1905, Alberta and Saskatchewan entered Confederation as the
eighth and ninth provinces of Canada.
   In 1923, the Japanese cities of Tokyo and Yokohama were
devastated by an earthquake that claimed some 150,000 lives.
   In 1932, New York City Mayor James J. ``Gentleman Jimmy'' Walker
resigned following charges of graft and corruption in his
administration.
   In 1945, Americans received word of Japan's formal surrender,
ending World War II. (Because of the time difference, it was
September 2 in Tokyo Bay, where the surrender took place.)
   In 1951, the United States, Australia and New Zealand signed a
mutual defense pact that came to be known as the ANZUS treaty.
   In 1961, the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on atomic testing
with an above-ground nuclear explosion in central Asia.
   In 1969, a coup in Libya brought Moammar Gadhafi to power.
   In 1972, American Bobby Fischer won the international chess crown
in Reykjavik, Iceland, by defeating Soviet player Boris Spassky in
their final match.
   In 1976, U.S. Rep. Wayne L. Hays, D-Ohio, resigned in the wake of
a scandal in which he admitted having an affair with secretary
Elizabeth Ray.
   In 1983, 269 people were killed when a Korean Air Lines Boeing
747 was shot down by a Soviet jet fighter after the airliner entered
Soviet airspace.
   In 1983, Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, a 30-year Senate veteran known
for his liberal views on social issues and a hawkish stand on
national defense, died in Everett, Wash., at age 71.
   Ten years ago: Hurricane David tore across the Dominican
Republic, leaving hundreds of dead in its wake, before slashing
across the Windward Passage into the mountains of eastern Cuba. The
Pioneer 11 space probe survived two crossings through debris
circling the ringed planet Saturn.
   Five years ago: The astronauts aboard the shuttle Discovery
launched their third commercial satellite in three days.
   One year ago: Shipyard workers at Gdansk, Poland, ended an
eleven-day strike, acting with some reluctance on the advice of
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Today's Birthdays: Former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird is 67.
Actress Yvonne De Carlo is 65. Country singer Conway Twitty is 56.
Conductor Seiji Ozawa is 54. Comedian-actress Lily Tomlin is 50.
Singer Barry Gibb is 43.
   Thought for Today: ``The right of conquest has no foundation
other than the right of the strongest.'' _ Jean Jacques Rousseau,
French political philosopher (1712-1778).

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Robert Dole.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton might've
settled it at 50 paces. Dole and Bush returned to the campaign.
   High noon on the Evening News.
   Dan Rather wanted to talk about Iran-Contra. George Bush wanted
to talk about education and the deficit. Rather said he wanted to
set the record straight. Bush said Rather had impugned his
integrity. Rather said he didn't want to be argumentative, but.
Bush said it was unfair to judge his whole record by Iran and (as
if bringing up a family scandal) ``how would you like it if I
judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the
set?'' Rather said it was more important to discuss Bush's
qualifications for president than (as if delicately paraphrasing a
profanity) ``what you just referred to.''
   The temperature rose, the pace quickened and soon both were
talking at once and, mercifully, neither could be heard.
   In their traveling debates, the candidates pelted each other,
relentlessly, with marshmallows while audiences coast to coast
wondered if the cavalry would never come. Democrat or Republican,
the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front-runner
since he had the most votes and some might drop loose. Issues were
as hard to find as passion.
   Almost invariably, nobody picked on Jackson or the reincarnated
Hart because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other's
non-existent. Jackson, once the voice of protest in the land, took
on the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided the
others when they lost their heads and became adversarial.
   Jackson, of course, couldn't do anything about Dole. On national
TV one night, Dole accused Bush of ``lying'' about his record, and
across the land political behaviorists tsked and said wasn't that
shocking?
   Through the last century, calling presidential candidates liar
was a relatively polite form of discourse. They were also called
traitor, lecher, murderer, thief, drunkard, atheist, pickpocket,
syphilitic, gorilla.
   In the campaign of 1800, John Adams' Federalists described
Thomas Jefferson as a ``mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of
a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father ...
raised wholly on hoecake made of coarse-ground Southern corn, bacon
and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.''
   Jefferson's Republicans lashed back by spreading a story that
President Adams was plotting to marry off one of his sons to a
daughter of King George III to begin an American dynasty and revive
royal links with Britain.
   In the politesse of the 1988 primary campaign, candidates
grappled more with their image than with each other. Media
consultants and other unfrocked shrinks along the way agreed that
Dole, for example, had to fight a mean streak; Bush, a wimp streak.
   Other perceived streaks to be resisted were Dukakis,
mechanistic; Alexander Haig, militaristic; Pierre Samuel du Pont
IV, rich; Simon, dull; Robertson, ``funny facts.''
   They tried various disguises. Dole smiled more. Bush thrashed
Rather. Dukakis danced to bouzouki music. Simon flipped pancakes.
Haig cozied a baby pig. Du Pont said call me Pete.
   Hart and Biden brought the Democrats odd headlines. Pat
Robertson took care of the Republicans.
   In his autobiography, Robertson wrote that God had told him a
minister should not run for public office. Then he announced he
might run for president. Then his book was re-issued, with God's
injunction excised. Then he announced that God was now telling him
to run. No other candidate claimed that endorsement.
   In New Hampshire, Robertson let it be known that the Russians
still had nuclear missiles in Cuba. Not true, said the White House,
but its source was a satellite only 2,000 miles up. Did Robertson
have word from higher authority?
   In Atlanta, Robertson said he knew where the American hostages
were held in Lebanon, and in Washington President Reagan wondered
aloud why he hadn't shared that information with the government.
   And then George Bush put on his cowboy boots, Al Gore donned his
down-home smile, Mike Dukakis packed up the old folks, Pat
Robertson dusted off the family album and away they went, to Super
Tuesday, on a frantic steeplechase across 20 states in which the
corn pone of Dixie was mixed with the slick sell of Madison Avenue
and a handshake was replaced by a greeting from outer space.
   No primary day ever before had demanded so much travel. So
candidates flitted around like nervous fleas on a dog having a
nightmare, and the constant motion, the merciless speechifying, the
pounding TV commercials produced a numbing blur. The Washington
Post called it Stupor Tuesday.
   Gone were the leisurely ``coffees'' the candidates had with
voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Now they hopped from airport to
airport, saw no voters, talked fast for local TV and were gone
again. Or they holed up in a hotel room and took questions from TV
stations hundreds of miles away and answered via a satellite 22,300
miles above the equator.
   Back on earth and lacking only a magnolia in his ear, Pat
Robertson strode the red clay hills of South Carolina proclaiming,
``I'm the only candidate who was born at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital. I'm the only one who went to college where Robert E. Lee
was president.''
   And to the condos of south Florida they came, to the homes and
the pools of senior citizens who take their franchise seriously.
Richard Gephardt appeared in their living rooms with a glowing TV
benediction from a local hero, Rep. Claude Pepper, 87. Dukakis
showed up with former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., 75, who
spoke highly of Dukakis' position on Social Security and Medicare.
   Gephardt sent his 80-year-old mother to the condos in person.
Dukakis rallied. He sent his 84-year-old mother and his 79-year-old
father-in-law.
   And the crocuses came and they campaigned in Illinois and
Connecticut and the forsythia came and they campaigned in Wisconsin
and New York and the dogwood came and they campaigned in
Pennsylvania and Ohio and the azaleas came and they campaigned in
New Jersey and California and, each in turn, like the petals of a
flower whose time had come, they fell gently to earth, all but
three.
