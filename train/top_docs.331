<HEAD>Magnetic Field Around Neptune Discovered By Voyager 2</HEAD>

   The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that
a magnetic field surrounds Neptune, suggesting the planet is
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like Earth's
northern lights, NASA announced Friday.
   Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to
determine the exact length of a day on Neptune, believed to be 17 to
18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of Neptune's
internal structure, said Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Just as Earth's magnetic field traps the Van Allen radiation
belts, Neptune's magnetic field also may help create radiation belts
around that planet. Scientists don't yet know if that poses a hazard
to Voyager 2's electronic components, Murrill said.
   Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from Earth and 5.92 million miles
from Neptune on Friday, speeding toward the giant gas planet at
42,236 mph.
   The spacecraft was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Voyager 2 will make its closest
approach to Neptune at 8:59 p.m. PDT on Thursday when it flies about
3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest
planet.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to the two discovered from Earth, two partial rings, or ring arcs,
of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to
jet streams and giant cyclones on Earth.
   Discovery of Neptune's magnetic field was confirmed Friday by
intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's
vicinity. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically
charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
field lines.
   ``Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have magnetic
fields, while Venus and Mars do not,'' the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said in a news release. ``Whether Pluto has one
or not is unknown.
   ``A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines
that surround a planet,'' the agency said. ``Such fields are thought
to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. (Molten iron in
Earth's core, for example).''
   Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along
magnetic field lines toward Earth's poles, creating the northern and
southern lights. A magnetic field at Neptune means that planet also
may have auroras, NASA said.
   Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand
Neptune's internal structure. Voyager project scientist Edward Stone
has said he believes that Neptune's hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock
closer to the planet's center. That would mean that Neptune _ like
neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings
to turn them dark in color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause
similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs,
NASA said.
   The nature of Neptune's radio signal allowed scientists to
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said James Warwick, head
of Voyager's radio science team.
   ``The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur
in a limited range of frequency,'' Warwick, a scientist at Boulder,
Colo.-based Radiophysics Inc., said in the release.
   Once NASA confirmed the existence of Neptune's magnetic field
Friday, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in
data collected by Voyager as early as Monday.
   ``Early analysis indicates Neptune's magnetic field is of an
intensity similar to the fields of Earth and Uranus,'' NASA said.
   Murrill said scientists don't yet know how Neptune's magnetic
field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet
spins.
   Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the
planet's north rotational axis.

   Discovery of a magnetic field around
Neptune suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but
NASA hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies
past the planet.
   ``Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said Norm
Haynes, Voyager project manager at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Similar radiation belts at Jupiter disrupted Voyager's internal
clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the
wrong time.
   Today, Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from Earth and 5.01 million
miles from Neptune, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251
mph.
   The ship will make its closest approach to Neptune at 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of
the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was
launched in 1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and
Uranus in 1986.
   NASA announced Friday that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike
radio signals coming from Neptune _ strong evidence the planet has a
magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed
electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere
along magnetic field lines.
   Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have magnetic fields.
Venus and Mars do not. Whether Pluto has one is unknown, NASA said.
   Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a
planet's core. Molten iron in Earth's core, for example, creates a
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the Van Allen belts.
   Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a
nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft
electronics.
   So far at Neptune, ``there's nothing to indicate it (the
radiation) is anything worse than we expected,'' said Haynes. ``But
time will tell.''
   Existence of Neptune's magnetic field suggests the planet has an
aurora like Earth's northern and southern lights, created when
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a
planet's poles.
   Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists
determine the exact length of a day on Neptune _ now believed to be
between 17 and 18 Earth hours _ and gain better understanding of
Neptune's internal structure, said Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spokeswoman Mary Beth Murrill.
   Voyager project scientist Edward Stone has said he believes
Neptune's hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center.
   That would mean that Neptune, like neighboring Uranus, probably
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in
color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause similar radiation
darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, NASA said.
   NASA on Friday also released new photographs taken by Voyager.
Blurry black-and-white images show markings on Triton, Neptune's
largest moon, but ``it is still too early to tell if the features
are clouds or features on Triton's surface,'' NASA said.
   A color photo of Neptune shows complex, frequently changing
weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy
clouds, a small cloud dubbed ``the scooter'' because it rotates
quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks.
   In recent weeks, Voyager also has discovered four Neptunian moons
besides two observed from Earth; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of
debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet
streams on Earth.

   After the Magellan spacecraft goes into
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 97 percent carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into Venus' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on Earth's surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on Earth.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth. Venus' surface is about 65 percent
rolling plains, 27 percent flat lowlands and 8 percent highlands
that may be similar to Earth's continents.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting Venus now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to Earth's hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like Earth's northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by Saturn, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form Titan's surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval Earth between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found Saturn's atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, Mariner and Pioneer probes found
that Venus is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through Venus' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on Earth.
   Photographs taken of Mercury by Mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard Mariner 10 found that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the Earth's and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976 and 1977
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier Mariners found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce summer storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 is converging on
Neptune, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager
at the National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on Nep
a giant storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, Voyager will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
Neptune's north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, Voyager will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, Triton. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.
   Neptune, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times Earth's size and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit
Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting Neptune, said
physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from Earth, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
Earth's hurricanes or Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving Neptune's storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
Neptune _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, Stone said.
   Despite any internal heat, Neptune receives 900 times less
sunlight than Earth, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on Triton,
Stone said.
   Scientists believe Triton _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of Earth's moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977. They visited Jupiter in
1979 and Saturn in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in 1986. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of Jupiter, Saturn
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of Neptune.
   At a cost Haynes pegged at $865 million through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of

   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Far in the cold darkness beyond Neptune,
a lonely Voyager speeds into the void, dozens of worlds in its wake
as it leaves a legacy that may aid the survival of its home planet,
a garden island in a sea of space.
   What wonders Voyager 2 witnessed as the one-ton spacecraft
cruised the solar system, traversing an arc-shaped 4{-billion-mile
path in 12 years as it trekked past four planets and at least 56
moons:
   In 1979, Jupiter and its moon Io, a hellish satellite of
sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Saturn and its graceful rings in 1981.
Five years later, Uranus, knocked on its side by some
incomprehensible collision. And today, the probe is 5 million miles
past deep blue Neptune, with its frozen volcanic moon Triton, once
flooded by seas of icy lava.
   Such marvels, such sights never before seen by human eyes, were
returned to Earth in 81,000 photographs captured by television
cameras aboard Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, which explored
Jupiter and Saturn before hurtling toward the stars.
   And what, one may ask, did these humble Voyagers, these piles of
1960s electronics, do for their human masters, for the American
taxpayers who paid the $865 million to propel them to the outer
planets?
   ``The immediate benefits of Voyager's pictures of Neptune and
Triton and their wealth of scientific information is to stimulate
our intellects and to nourish our souls,'' said Bruce Murray,
president of The Planetary Society and former director of the
National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``But surely over the coming generations those arcane facts will
become relevant to our destiny on Earth, just as earlier arcane
facts from Venus and Mars are now considered vital to our destiny.''
   Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan said: ``If you want to
understand Earth, go look at other worlds.''
   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied how
Venus' thick clouds trap solar heat, warming the planet to 900
degrees in a runaway ``greenhouse effect.'' It helped alert
scientists to how industrial air pollutants threaten to warm Earth,
flooding coastal areas and triggering droughts and starvation.
   Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned of depletion of
Earth's ozone layer after using chemical formulas devised to help
NASA understand Venus' atmosphere, Sagan said.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.
   ``The lesson we're learning is that the complexity of the
universe is something you'll never imagine without looking at it,''
U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom said Tuesday at
a final news briefing on Voyager 2.
   At Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons in addition to Nereid
and Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one ring.
   Voyager detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere an Earth-size
swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph winds,
photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus clouds
of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   It also revealed two types of ice volcanoes on frosty, pinkish
Triton: 1,000-foot-deep craters measuring hundreds of miles across
that once produced ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, and
volcanoes that may be active today, ejecting nitrogen ice 25 miles
high at speeds of 560 mph.
   Scientists presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune's weak,
tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet but is
offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That and
other evidence suggest the liquid that generates the magnetic field
may exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core
as inside the Earth.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
Voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery,'' said
Voyager project scientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate
enough to be involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will collect information about particles and magnetic
fields in space and search for the edge of the solar system, sending
Earth information until about 2020.
   Then, carrying copper videodisks of pictures and recorded sounds
of Earth, the Voyagers will spend billions of years orbiting the
center of the Milky Way.
   Perhaps one day, an alien civilization will find one of the
Voyagers and play the record. They will hear a simple message
recorded by a 7-year-old boy from another time and another world:
   ``Greetings from the children of the planet Earth.''

   Geologists may get a glimpse of what
Earth's surface was like a few billion years ago when the Magellan
spacecraft's radar pierces the clouds of Venus to reveal secrets of
an alien terrain.
   ``Venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in
detail, and probably is the most important from the point of view
of understanding the Earth,'' said Jim Head, a member of NASA's
Magellan science team and a geology professor at Brown University
in Providence, R.I.
   Magellan fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around
Venus on Friday after a 15-month, 948-million-mile voyage from
Earth.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitored the
spacecraft's health Saturday so it will be ready by Sept. 1 to use
its radar to peer through thick Venusian clouds and make the most
detailed pictures and maps yet of the planet's landscape.
   Magellan entered orbit so smoothly that it used very little
thruster fuel to point it properly while the rocket fired. So
Magellan weighs more and moves faster than expected, making the low
point in its orbit 183 miles above Venus instead of 171 miles as
planned, said navigation chief John McNamee.
   The orbit is so good that an adjustment maneuver planned for
Aug. 28 will not be needed, Magellan project manager Tony Spear
said Saturday.
   Magellan is designed to study the geology and geography of
Venus, heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a ``greenhouse effect''
gone berserk.
   Venus' high temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure might
make rock in the planet's crust much thinner and more flexible than
Earth's, Head said.
   So Venus may resemble Earth before our home planet's crust
cooled off and broke into colossal plates. Those plates now drift
across the face of the Earth, moving whole continents and colliding
to uplift mountain ranges and trigger volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes.
   Most of Earth's original surface was destroyed long ago by
erosion and plate movements, so ``we have grave difficulty
answering fundamental questions about the early history of the
Earth,'' Head said.
   While Venus is hot, dry and lifeless, ``it is very similar in
size and density and also is the closest planet to the Earth,'' he
said. ``That means it probably had the most similar conditions when
the planets formed (4.6 billion years ago). So if we want to study
another planet to learn something about the early Earth, Venus is a
good candidate.''
   Learning how Venus' crust moves and is deformed ``will tell us a
lot more about the Earth,'' said Steve Saunders, NASA's chief
scientist for Magellan.
   Magellan may settle debate over competing theories that seek to
explain the creation of Venus' continent-like highlands, which
include Africa-sized Aphrodite Terra, Australia-sized Ishtar Terra
and Hawaii-like Beta Regio.
   Saunders believes ``hot spots'' of rising molten rock created
the highlands, just as hot spots created Hawaii on Earth.
   ``If you could look at a time-lapse movie over billions of
years, it might look like a big pot of thick porridge simmering,'
Saunders said, adding Venus' crust may feature ``a bunch of big
Hawaiis all over the place.''
   Some other scientists think Venus' highlands are big pieces of
crust that solidified first as the planet's initial molten surface
cooled off.
   But Head believes plate movements formed the highlands.
Aphrodite Terra resembles Earth's midocean ridges, the undersea
mountain ranges where molten rock emerges to add new material to
the drifting plates of crust.
   Ishtar Terra ``has many of the features that you would expect
where blocks of crust are colliding,'' including volcanoes such as
those along the Pacific coasts of Alaska and South America and
folded mountain belts such as Earth's Himalayas, which were created
because India is smashing into Asia.
   Even if the Venusian crust hasn't yet broken into plates, ``we
probably will find faults like the San Andreas in California,'' a
pretty sure sign that ``Venusquakes'' shake the second planet from
the sun, Saunders said.

   Voyager 2 cruised away from Neptune and
toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $865 million trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from Earth and 4.2 million
miles beyond Neptune, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from Earth in 1977, past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in
1981 and Uranus in 1986, and now past Neptune in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980.
   For $865 million _ 20 cents per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like Jupiter's moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
Voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At Neptune, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to Nereid
and Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish Triton. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than a half billion years ago, said U.S. Geological Survey
geologist Laurence Soderblom.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on Triton's surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune's
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the Earth.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of Magellan,'' said
Planetary Society vice president Bruce Murray, former director of
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of Earth, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
Sagan said.
   He said Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned of
depletion of Earth's ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help NASA understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.
   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on Venus, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   Sagan said Voyager also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until 2020.

   Voyager 2's close-up photos of Neptune's
moon Triton reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt
explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles
high, scientists said Sunday.
   ``I believe they are active,'' or erupted at least within the
past 100 years, said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Larry
Soderblom, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``There's 10 or 20 or 30 _ lots.''
   ``This is a crazy idea ... but it's the best we have at the
current time'' to explain the pockmarked terrain, he added.
   While more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active,
``the whole process makes physical sense,'' said Bradford Smith,
leader of the Voyager 2 imaging team. ``That is a perfectly sensible
explanation.''
   If Soderblom and Smith are right, Triton is only the third object
in the solar system known to have active volcanism. Earth and
Jupiter's moon Io are the others.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes with
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io. But he said the volcanoes on Triton
are produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools rises
to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got to explode
and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps faster,
sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said Smith, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. The
deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened ices that fell to the
surface after being carried skyward by the blast, he added.
   Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday night
when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloud
tops. Early Friday morning, the spacecraft zoomed about 24,000 miles
past Triton, taking the photos that have revealed at least three
kinds of icy volcanism on the moon.
   Voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from the
floors of long valleys, a process likened to toothpaste coming out
of a tube slit with a razor blade.
   On Friday, scientists announced that Voyager had discovered a
different type of ice volcanoes, which appeared inactive and
possibly extinct. They are huge flat craters, called calderas,
similar to the one in which Yellowstone National Park rests.
   Some calderas, such as the crater atop Hawaii's Kilauea volcano,
fill with lava lakes. Triton's calderas, measuring up to hundreds of
miles wide, fill with flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that
gushes up from below, Smith said.
   New evidence released Sunday shows Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can
come up and overflow. You see that happen in Hawaii all the time''
when molten rock lava overflows crater walls, Smith said.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced ``a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions,'' resulting in ``massive,
oceanic-scale flooding,'' Soderblom said during a Sunday news
conference. He said at least four such calderas have been spotted on
Triton.
   Soderblom said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the past
century because they are located on Triton's huge south polar ice
cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.
   So far, Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune, in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It
also has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including
two that are broad bands of dust.
   The latest ring photo released by NASA Sunday shows one of those
bands is even broader than thought, forming a beautiful, circular
sheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of Neptune's rings
and extends inward toward the planet.
   NASA's latest results from Voyager's close encounters with
Neptune and Triton found that:
   _Winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in Neptune's
atmosphere.
   _A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or take
four minutes.
   _Neptune's south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, are
much hotter than the planet's middle latitudes.
   _The planet's magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degrees
away from from the poles around which the planet rotates, a much
greater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially
estimated. That means Neptune's magnetic north pole is closer to its
equator than to its rotational north pole.
   It also means Neptune is much more similar to Uranus, which has a
magnetic field tilt of 58 degrees. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted
12 degrees from its true, or rotational poles.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.19 million miles behind Neptune, speeding away from the
planet at 37,621 mph.
   The probe on Sunday was looking for lightning and auroras on
Triton. It also sent back its best picture of heart-shaped moon
1989N1, which has usurped Nereid as Neptune's second-largest moon.

   Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny
``moonlets'' hidden in one of Neptune's two brightest rings, and
also found three more rings orbiting the planet, NASA said Saturday.
   Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's
fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a
tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like Earth's northern
and southern lights.
   The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up 78 percent
of Earth's atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of
Triton, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink
snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed
viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is
present as well, they said.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Sunday, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from
Neptune, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will
be 2.75 billion miles from Earth. Voyager traveled a curving
4.43-billion-mile path to achieve Thursday night's close encounter
with Neptune and Friday morning's flight past Triton.
   ``We have five rings at Neptune,'' including the two bright ones
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said Bradford
Smith, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Smith said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't
well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as
five. He reversed himself later Saturday, deciding the rings are
distinct enough to count the total as five.
   A bright ring discovered Aug. 11 initially appeared to be a
partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring.
Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12
miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, Smith said.
   ``You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said.
   Smith said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring
has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others.
   So far, Voyager has discovered six objects orbiting Neptune that
are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight
moons, including Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth.
   The ring containing the moonlets remains Neptune's outermost
ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring,
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse
band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest
to Neptune is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band
of dust NASA said was 1,550 miles wide.
   The initial confusion over the number of Neptune's rings is
reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in 1986. Ten thin rings were
apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed
that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible
when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing
how many distinct rings orbit Uranus.
   Researchers said Saturday that Voyager also found:
   _Neptune's magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away
from the poles around which the planet rotates. Earth's magnetic
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one
magnetic pole in northern Canada about 1,000 miles from the true, or
rotational, north pole.
   _The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than
the Van Allen belts encircling Earth. The radiation belt's location
near the orbit of Triton may explain the pinkish hue of some of the
moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas
that color.
   Deputy Voyager project scientist Ellis Miner said there is
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south
latitude, Neptune has an aurora similar to Earth's northern and
southern lights. Other scientists Saturday refused to discuss the
evidence, saying it was too preliminary.
   If the aurora proves real, Neptune's tilted magnetic field would
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's
equator rather than the rotational poles.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth,
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational
poles are relatively close.
   Voyager continued Saturday to send back recorded photographs
taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed
photos of Triton.
   The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global
temperature map of Neptune, search for auroras and more rings, and
study the weight of Neptune and Triton.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look
back at Neptune. Then it will head toward interstellar space,
looking for the edge of the solar system.

   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' has
eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds
or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing
atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support
anything resembling human life.
   Venus is not exactly Kansas.
   For eight months beginning in August 1990, the space probe
Magellan will circle the second planet from the Sun, using
computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable
that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.
   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the Magellan
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of
Earth.
   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that
will completely astound and baffle us,'' said Steve Saunders,
Magellan's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis, to be launched from Earth orbit on its 15-month
trajectory to Venus.
   Pictures from Magellan should help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else,'' said geologist Laurence Soderblom, a scientist
working on the Magellan project.
   Peering through acid-laden clouds, Magellan should give
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different
from the garden of Earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologic
processes.
   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like our
own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' NASA says.
   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,
meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary
movement of huge land masses. Magellan will also look for evidence
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.
   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier U.S.
and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might
produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,
where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing Everest.
   Magellan, once it begins orbiting Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, will
look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the
planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked
``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the
temperature until water disappeared.
   It's a $550-million project with the scientific world watching.
   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar
system,'' said Soderblom, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey
in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plotting
the path of Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the
planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977
miles.
   In looking for similarities between Venus and Earth, scientists
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and
distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than Earth's moon,
Mercury and Mars.
   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot
for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said
Saunders, himself a geologist.
   The moon, Mercury and Mars have cold surfaces free of
continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives the
geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe Venus and Earth
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, Saunders said.
   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs
from that on Earth.
   Rock in Earth's crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt
manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea
mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away
from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually
collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subduction
zone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath Alaska, Washington
and Oregon.
   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.
   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and
subduction zones. Saunders and Gerald Schaber, another USGS
geologist, believe Venus loses its internal heat mostly through
``hot spot'' volcanoes.
   On Earth, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through
thin parts of the crust, such as in Hawaii. But there's evidence
that Venus has crustal movement similar to Earth and that the
volcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of Earth's midocean
ridges.
   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on
Venus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are
squeezed up against Venus' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and
Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than Everest.
   These regions look something like Earth's Himalayas, mountains
formed when India smashed into China. So crustal movements on Venus
may be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, Schaber said.
   If large plates of Venus' crustal rock are in motion, ``you can
bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.

   Venus may be ``a terrible place to
live,'' but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures,
incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to
learn about the solar system's evolution.
   A robot craft called Magellan, the first American space probe in
11 years, is on its way to survey Venus for clues to the forces
that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun.
   The $550 million craft will use a powerful radar imaging system
to map Venus' surface, where scientists believe the geologic
history of the planet is imprinted. By studying that history,
scientists hope to learn what's contained in the ``the missing
chapters'' of solar system evolution.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said Venus is known as the
Earth's sister planet because it is about the same size as Earth
and close to the same distance from the sun, in astronomical terms.
Venus, the second planet from the sun, is 67 million miles away,
while Earth, the third planet, is 93 million miles out.
   Despite the similarities, Venus ``has evolved into ... a
substantially different object,'' Fisk said.
   ``It has an atmosphere that is 90 times that of the Earth. It
has a runaway greenhouse effect. It has a surface temperature of
900 degrees. And it rains sulfuric acid,'' Fisk said. ``It would be
a terrible place to live.''
   The Earth and Venus, along with Mercury and Mars, are known as
the ``inner planets'' because of their grouping nearer to the sun
than the ``outer'' planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The family of inner planets are all thought to have accreted, or
formed, 4.5 billion years ago. In the beginning, it's believed,
Venus and Earth were near-twins in size and character.
   But while the Earth went on to become a lovely, gentle world
thriving with life, Venus became a hellhole _ so hot that lead
melts on its surface.
   ``You've got to ask yourself why?'' Fisk said. ``You've got to
ask yourself if our own environment is that fragile? With only
small changes, could Earth evolve into a different place?''
   Magellan may help answer some of those questions.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to slip into Venus' orbit in August
1990, and spend the following 243 days mapping the planet's surface
with the most sophisticated radar ever sent to deep space.
   Radar signals are able to penetrate the dense cloud cover that
conceals Venus from telescopes on Earth. Radar views from Magellan
will be enhanced by NASA computers to give clear pictures of
powerful geologic forces at work on Venus.
   All the data could help experts ponder a fundamental question:
Is the Earth, like Venus, fated to one day become a barren,
lifeless world backing in superheat and bathed by acids?
   Scientists expect to find thousands of volcanoes rising from the
baked Venusian plains. Venus also has vast mountain ranges with
peaks towering higher than the Earth's Mount Everest.
   Most scientists believe the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus,
caused by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, long ago caused
all water on the planet to boil away.
   The experts also will look for indications of continental drift,
the force that causes rock plates to inch about the globe over
millions of years.
   If there is evidence of volcanism and crustal drift on Venus, it
will prove that the planet retains enough internal heat to melt
rock. The internal heat machine is what creates the lava for
volcanoes and drives the movement of continents.
   Meteors crashing into the shallow surface crust of the planet
are expected to have left craters in every sector of Venus. Fisk
said these scars will be of particular interest to experts. The age
of a solid planet or moon, he said, can be calculated by the number
and distribution of craters.
   ``Knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just one of the natural
consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system'' will help
answer such questions, said Laurence Soderblom of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   He said Magellan also may help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else'' in the universe.

   A bedeviled, beleaguered NASA is hoping
the Magellan spacecraft's rendezvous with Venus next month will
provide our best look yet at Earth's hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the $413 million unmanned device,
centerpiece of a $744 million mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on Aug. 10 after a 15-month journey from
Earth. And NASA desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how NASA has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said Steve
Saunders, the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the $1.5 billion Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for Magellan.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said Phil Allin, a Magellan project official at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot Mount Maxwell, which is a mile
taller than Earth's Mount Everest.
   NASA says Magellan's radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on Earth.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
Earth's.
   Magellan's mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said Jim Head, a member of the Magellan science
team and a geologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the Earth and
Mercury, but Venus always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long Magellan was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At 9:31 a.m. PDT on Aug. 10, Magellan will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above Venus.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of 70 percent
to 90 percent of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, Saunders said.
   If scientists are lucky, Magellan may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created Hawaii.
   Venus is the planet most like Earth in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is Earth's nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited Venus since the early 1960s,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
Earth, and from NASA's Pioneer Venus orbiter in 1978 and the Soviet
Union's Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in 1983.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. Saunders said
Magellan's pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   Magellan will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, Magellan will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of Venus' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, Magellan will radio the
information back to Earth, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at NASA's Deep Space Network
stations in California, Spain and Australia.
   Computers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' Saunders
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   Magellan's main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. NASA is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the Magellan mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is $744 million, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said Bill Dimmer of NASA's
comptroller's office in Washington. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for $413 million of that total, he said.

   Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands
of dust orbiting Neptune and found evidence the planet has
``southern lights,'' NASA said today.
   The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of Triton, the
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited
scientists as unique in the solar system, NASA said.
   ``There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said NASA astronomer Rich
Terrile, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands
orbit Neptune's equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered
by Voyager earlier.
   Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with Neptune
and Triton, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken
during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers
celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby.
   ``My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had
one hell of a party last night,'' Mike Urban, a Voyager engineer,
said today.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m. PDT Friday.
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons
besides Triton and Nereid, which were first observed from Earth. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be
a complete ring.
   While only the narrow rings were visible as Voyager flew toward
Neptune, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, Terrile said.
That makes them look like Saturn's broad rings, but only when viewed
from behind Neptune.
   The same thing happened when Voyager passed Uranus in 1986. That
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft,
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus.
Terrile said Neptune's dust bands are not as extensive.
   Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at
30 degrees south latitude on Neptune as Voyager's ultraviolet light
sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project
scientist Ellis Miner said today.
   Because the scan didn't cover different longitudes, scientists
don't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles Neptune
east to west, as do Earth's auroras, Miner said.
   Miner said Voyager also found nitrogen in Triton's atmosphere.
Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth's atmosphere.
   On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles,
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates
magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on
Earth to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On
Earth they glow in visible light. Neptune's lights glow ultraviolet
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere.
   Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape
recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during
the Neptune and Triton rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, Urban said.
   Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of
Triton, which is four-fifth's the size of Earth's moon. But pictures
returned Friday were more than enough to stun scientists.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
Carl Sagan said Friday. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The photographs show a cracked, frozen Triton scarred by
thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters,
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far
defy explanation.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist Edward Stone said
Friday at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some
other moons, but Triton is the first place scientists have actually
seen ice volcanoes, Stone said. Photographs showed at least three
inactive volcanoes.
   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000
to 2,000 feet high.
   The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen
``are very different from ordinary ice,'' said Sagan, a member of
the Voyager imaging team. ``That may explain the exoticness of the
landforms.''
   Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment
of radiation that produced chemical changes, Sagan said. ``We've got
pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.''
   Preliminary measurements of Triton's magnetic field suggest that
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like Earth's magnetic
field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said.
   Robert Strom of the Voyager imaging team said the relative
scarcity of craters on Triton tends to confirm speculation that
Triton originated outside the solar system and became captured by
Neptune's gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons.
   Voyager also revealed that Triton has an atmosphere and is
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog.
   On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other
volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and
condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look
back at Neptune. Then it will head toward interstellar space.
   Weary NASA scientists, many of whom spent all night at the
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over
the spectacular images being received.
   Laurence Soderblom of the Voyager imaging team said: ``Wow! What
a way to leave the solar system.''

VOYAGER DISCOVERS MAGNETIC FIELD ON NEPTUNE

<P>
For the first time, the spacecraft Voyager has detected intense radio signals 
coming from Neptune, revealing that the planet has a magnetic field and 
indicating that next week's close encounter will be as intriguing as scientists 
had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery suggests that the spacecraft will find a wide range of 
interesting phenomena as it passes close to the distant planet Thursday night, 
including the kind of auroral activity that produces the northern and southern 
lights on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The signals were first detected last Monday, but scientists at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory were not sure they were coming from Neptune, according to 
James Warwick, principal investigator on the planetary radio astronomy 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not What Was Expected 
</P>
<P>
"Their character was different than what we were expecting," Warwick said. 
</P>
<P>
"The radio emissions are very intense," Warwick said, adding that they came in 
short, powerful bursts over a limited frequency range. Scientists had expected 
radio signals from Neptune, but they were looking for something less intense 
and less limited in frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
Warwick and fellow scientists working on the project decided to announce the 
discovery Friday after they grew more confident of what they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery means Neptune has a strong magnetic field because radio waves are 
generated by charged particles that become trapped in the magnetic field and 
spiral into the planet's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same process that produces the northern lights on Earth. Charged 
particles from space flow along the Earth's magnetic field lines and into the 
atmosphere at either the North or South Pole, producing the celestial fireworks 
over the higher latitudes. Now, Voyager is expected to see the same thing at 
Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Within 3,000 Miles 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager spacecraft, which will make its fourth and final planetary flyby 
next week when it passes within about 3,000 miles of Neptune's cloud tops, used 
a radio receiver and a giant pair of "rabbit ears" to detect the radio 
emissions -- just as it did at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Each 33-foot-long 
ear scans a series of frequencies and, since they work separately, the 
"polarization," or vibration, of the signals can be determined, thus 
distinguishing between radio signals generated by lightning and those created 
by a magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are dealing with a magnetic field," Warwick said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a magnetic field also tells scientists something about the 
interior of Neptune. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of 
its molten iron core, and Neptune's strong magnetic field suggests that Neptune 
also has a region of fluid in its interior. 
</P>
<P>
Venus, Mars and probably Pluto do not have magnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
Early analysis of the data from Voyager indicates that Neptune's magnetic field 
is similar in intensity to Earth's. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more data is collected on the magnetic field, scientists will be 
able to determine more precisely the length of a Neptunian day -- the time it 
takes for one rotation. That is believed to be about 18 hours, but by the time 
Voyager is through that figure should be known exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists have known little about Neptune other than such things as 
its atmospheric composition, which includes the methane that makes it appear 
blue. But Voyager will pass right over the planet's north pole, and that is 
fortuitous for scientists who are interested in its magnetic field. That 
trajectory will carry it through the intense field where charged particles are 
being funneled into the polar atmosphere, and that should reveal much about the 
field.

<P>
In fact, by the time Voyager zips past Neptune it will have collected enough 
data for scientists to learn more about its magnetic field than any other 
planet except Earth.

   The Galileo spaceship swooped past Venus
early Saturday, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at 12:59 a.m. EST, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said Bill O'Neil, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting Galileo to Jupiter has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
Earth confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered Galileo's infrared
light sensor to start observing Venus. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, O'Neil said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier Friday, Galileo studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said Galileo project scientist Torrence Johnson. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
Jupiter.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director Neal Ausman.
   The $1.35 billion mission will let Galileo examine Earth, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995, they
arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mercury,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on Earth. Venus is about 95
percent as wide as Earth. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give Galileo a boost for
its trip to Jupiter by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the Earth as a slingshot next Dec. 8 and again
on Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward Jupiter,
Ausman said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having Galileo's camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting Thursday night and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
Galileo's four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to Earth
until October, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past Earth.
   Galileo was programmed to photograph Venus and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with Venus'
atmosphere. At the same time, NASA arranged for the Pioneer Venus
Orbiter, circling Venus since 1978, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, Johnson said.
   While nearly 20 other U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited
Venus, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have Galileo send back a small
amount of data, Johnson added.
   Studies from Earth and previous spacecraft indicate Venus has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing Mount Everest and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least 70 percent of Venus'
surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally
planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching
it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. NASA decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So Galileo was launched with a much weaker Inertial Upper Stage
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required NASA to redesign Galileo's route so the craft could
utilize gravity from Venus and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to Jupiter.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop NASA from having a
shuttle carry Galileo into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate Florida with plutonium in Galileo's
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. NASA said the
risk was minimal.
   Galileo is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered Jupiter's major moons.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward Neptune, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from Earth.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone, referring to
Voyager's previous exploration of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the next week,'' Stone
said during a late morning news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for Thursday's close encounter with Neptune and
Friday's flight past its largest moon, Triton. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means Voyager will fly closest to Neptune about 8:55 p.m. PDT
Thursday.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at 8:15 a.m. PDT today indicating the thrusters
started firing at 4:09 a.m. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with Neptune has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' says Jurrie van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around Neptune's north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of Triton and another moon,
Nereid. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to Neptune, cable television stations will
carry live NASA broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which had been discovered from Earth,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting Neptune.
   Voyager also discovered Neptune has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like Earth's jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   NASA listed Voyager's position as of 9 a.m. today as 2.743
billion miles from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   Neptune, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   Thursday night, Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus
in 1986.
   Sunday was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
Florida on Aug. 20, 1977. The Neptune encounter is the climax of the
$865 million, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the Neptune encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will conduct daily news conferences through Aug. 29.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling Saturn and Uranus.
   They also say Neptune's magnetic field may create auroras like
Earth's northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind Neptune.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
Neptune's atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside Neptune.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   Voyager 2 found Neptune's moon Triton to
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward
and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean-size floods of
frozen lava, scientists believe.
   If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's
photographs, Triton is only the third object in the universe where
active volcanoes have been identified.
   ``It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the
solar system,'' says Charles Kohlhase, Voyager spacecraft mission
design manager at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras _ somewhat like Earth's northern and southern
lights _ in several places in Neptune's skies and over much of the
day side of Triton, Roger Yelle, of the University of Arizona, said
today.
   The auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light, and they occur at odd
places because of Neptune's tilted magnetic field, Yelle said. When
the particles are pulled toward Earth's poles along magnetic field
lines, they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble
auroras.
   Voyager today snapped and sent back to Earth beautiful
photographs showing the sunlit, crescent edges of Neptune and Triton
as they were backlighted by the sun. NASA expects to release prints
of the photo no earlier than Tuesday.
   Triton apparently has three types of volcanic activity.
   Scientists announced two of them Friday: huge inactive
crater-shaped volcanoes, called calderas, filled with lava made of
ice instead of molten rock; and long fault-line valleys filled with
oozing ice, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube
slit with a razor blade.
   Triton's biggest surprise came Sunday, when U.S. Geological
Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom announced that a third kind of
volcanic activity apparently had been identified. The latest
recorded photographs sent by Voyager reveal what look like active
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles
and gas 12 to 20 miles high.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said University of Arizona planetary scientist Bradford Smith,
leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be
a ``crazy idea,'' but other scientists expressed their support.
   ``It sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis,'' said Voyager
project scientist Edward Stone.
   Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune in addition to
Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It also has
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that
are broad bands of dust.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.65 million miles from Neptune, speeding toward
interstellar space at 37,600 mph.
   As the craft sped toward the ill-defined boundary of the solar
system, about 1,500 mission scientists, engineers and their families
celebrated at a bash that featured rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry
singing ``Go, Voyager, go!'' a slightly modified version of his
classic ``Johnny B. Goode.''
   A recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the
cultural and historical items aboard aboard Voyager.
   The spacecraft made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday
night when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole
cloudtops. Early Friday, it zoomed about 24,000 miles past Triton.
Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed
Triton's volcanic activity.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. But he said the
volcanoes on Triton are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground
pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   ``I believe they are active,'' Soderblom said. ``There's 10 or 20
or 30 _ lots.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps
faster.
   Smith said the deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the
blast.
   Earth's volcanoes spew molten rock, and Io's erupts sulfur. Venus
also may have active volcanoes, but none has been spotted on the
cloud-shrouded planet.
   On Sunday, NASA also revealed more surprises about Triton's
apparently inactive caldera-like volcanoes, which measure up to
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what Smith described as flows
of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.
   The new photos show Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can come up and
overflow,'' Smith said. ``You see that happen in Hawaii all the
time'' when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop Kilauea
volcano.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive,
oceanic-scale flooding, Soderblom said.
   A volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100
years. Smith said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located
on Triton's huge south polar ice cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past Neptune this week for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at JPL,'' joked Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, Sunday was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from Florida on Aug. 20, 1977.

   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday, when Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   As of 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction Monday morning, NASA engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the Neptune flyby.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct
daily news conferences starting Monday and continuing through Aug.
29.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of Neptune's
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were discovered from Earth. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on Earth, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle Saturn and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting Neptune.
   _A magnetic field surrounding Neptune, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like Earth's northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   The Neptune encounter is the climax of the $865 million,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Haynes said Monday's course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind
Neptune.
   Ellis Miner, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine Neptune's atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside Neptune.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to Earth
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, Miner said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to Earth, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with Neptune, Voyager will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, Voyager will start a 49-minute trip through
Neptune's shadow. Instead of photographing Neptune during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

   Neptune's icy volcanic moon Triton is the
coldest body ever measured in the solar system, NASA said Monday,
and the planet itself has something in common with Los Angeles: smog.
   The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like
Earth's northern lights on Neptune and Triton, scientists said.
   Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on Monday snapped a
series of family portraits of Neptune and Triton, appearing as
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.
   Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that
Triton's surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
making the moon ``the coldest body we have seen in the solar
system,'' said Roger Yelle of the University of Arizona.
   Scientists believe Pluto and its moon Charon are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   In another finding, the best close-up photo yet of another moon,
1989 N1, showed that Neptune's second-largest moon has a huge crater
about half as wide as the lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide satellite.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1,
one of six moons discovered since June by Voyager, according to
Bradford Smith, the leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find
liquid lakes or oceans on Triton, but the moon almost certainly is
too cold to have them, said Torrence Johnson, a scientist at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.
   Johnson defended the theory, advanced by other scientists Sunday,
that Triton has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles
20 miles skyward. ``It isn't a crazy idea,'' he said.
   Voyager's close encounter with Neptune occurred Thursday night
and it passed Triton on Friday, capping its epic tour of the four
outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The probe has also found five rings, including three thin ones
and two broad bands of dust.
   1989 N1 took Nereid's place as Neptune's second-largest moon
after Triton. N1 and the other five moons discovered by Voyager in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth,
have not yet been permanently named.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras somewhat like Earth's northern and southern lights
over wide sections of Neptune's skies and over much of Triton's day
side, said Yelle.
   But unlike Earth's auroras, which glow in visible light as
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases, the
auroras on Neptune and Triton are invisible to the human eye. That's
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles
excite hydrogen gas.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in Neptune's
atmosphere ``converts it into photochemical smog'' that forms a
90-mile-thick icy layer at the bottom of Neptune's stratosphere,
said Jim Pollock, an imaging team member from NASA's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, Calif.
   Smith said smog on Neptune and in Los Angeles have ``definite
similarities,'' although Los Angeles smog has components absent on
Neptune.
   Finding smog on Neptune ``is no surprise,'' Smith said.
``Photochemical smog exists any place (planet or moon) we've been
that has an atmosphere. In Los Angeles, the problem is it's
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts
exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' Saturn's smoggy
moon.
   Auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles
from the solar wind spiral toward a planet's magnetic poles along
magnetic field lines. On Earth, the magnetic poles are tilted only
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates, so
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions.
   Neptune's major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from
its rotational poles, and scientists have said the planet may have
multiple magnetic poles. That could explain why Neptune's auroras
appear over wide areas of the planet.
   Triton's aurora is created differently. Electrically charged
particles in Neptune's orbiting radiation belt, discovered recently
by Voyager, excite gases in Triton's atmosphere to create its
auroras, said Andy Chen of Johns Hopkins University.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Tuesday, Voyager will be 2.759 billion miles from
Earth and 4.097 million miles beyond Neptune, slowly decelerating as
it speeds toward the stars at 37,582 mph.
   NASA engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said Lanny Miller, manager of the flight
engineering office.

   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched since 1978, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around Venus today on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said George Alexander, chief spokesman for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
NASA and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the Hubble Space Telescope, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   Magellan dived over Venus' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at 9:32 a.m., slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed Magellan to be captured by Venus' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
Steve Wall.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
Venus, out of radio contact with engineers on Earth. Magellan
emerged at 9:53 a.m., but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time Magellan's radio
signal takes to reach Earth.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said David Okerson, a Magellan project
engineer.
   In the Magellan project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary Sharon Kyle.
   Magellan encountered Venus 144 million miles from Earth after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The $413 million Magellan, the heart of a $744 million mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by Sept. 1.
   NASA plans to release the first pictures in September, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   Magellan has raised NASA's hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Wesley T. Huntress Jr., NASA director of solar system exploration,
said Thursday. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot Magellan, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since 1978,
when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
Venus.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' Huntress said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
between 1979 and last year, but they were launched in 1977.
Galileo, launched in October, is headed toward a 1995 rendezvous
with Jupiter.
   During the coming decade or so, NASA also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, Saturn, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   NASA has said Magellan would return more data than all previous
NASA missions combined.
   Venus is similar to Earth in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   NASA wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to Earth's. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   Magellan was named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by Martin Marietta Corp. and its radar
was built by Hughes Aircraft Co.

   Here are some facts, figures and
theories about Venus, the planet visited early today by the
Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth, and
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 96 percent carbon dioxide and most of the rest
nitrogen, but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor.
The atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on Earth.
   DAY LENGTH: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, so one day on
Venus equals 243 Earth days. Its rotation is retrograde, so the sun
rises in the west and sets in the east.
   YEAR LENGTH: Venus orbits the sun once every 225 Earth days.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of Venus and the
evolution of our own Earth.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday, and six hours later,
Atlantis' five astronauts are to release Magellan on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in 1978, and Magellan will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches Venus in August 1990, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and Venus, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the 1978 Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   Magellan is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from Atlantis this year. The Galileo probe to Jupiter is
to set forth in October.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in 1986. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in January 1986, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Saunders said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
Russia's Venera 1, which scouted Venus in 1961. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The United States has successfully sent five probes to Venus,
six to Mars, four to Jupiter, three to Saturn, and one each to
Mercury and Uranus. And in August, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at Neptune.
   The Soviet Union has sent 19 successful spacecraft to Venus and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 last September while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of Jupiter; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of Saturn; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, NASA is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet Earth, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of Earth when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that Venus may represent what
might happen to Earth if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud-shrouded Venus for the best
look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky
at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting NASA administrator
Dale Meyers.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft Magellan, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The $550 million craft, which had to be launched
by May 28 or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. Magellan is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the Kennedy Space Center emergency landing site.
   NASA's first attempt to launch Atlantis last Friday was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander David M.
Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard,
Mary Cleave and Mark Lee.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send Magellan out of Earth orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching Venus.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above Earth
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path Magellan
must follow to reach Earth's mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until May 28. At that point, Earth and Venus would have moved out
of alignment and the Magellan mission would not be possible for two
years.
   Magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a U.S. planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but Venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The Earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by Venus because it is so close in size
to Earth, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the Earth, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on Earth, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that Venus' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   Magellan will rendezvous with Venus in August 1990. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to Earth for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   Magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what Lennard Fisk, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
America's planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in 1978, was the last U.S. space launch and Fisk
said America ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly past Neptune in August. It
earlier visted Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In October, the robot
craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in 1990,
and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said Fisk.

   From 3.8 billion miles, the Earth is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said Wednesday as NASA released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in February and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded Feb. 13-14 but were not played back to Earth until
late March because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Earth and Venus.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, Mercury was too close to the sun
to be photographed and Pluto was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, Earth was within a band of sunlight but
Sagan said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
August and September 1977 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years 2000 and 2010. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in 1975.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
Jupiter, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in 1962.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except Pluto,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

   Voyager 2 photographed an active geyser
or volcano blowing gaseous and frozen nitrogen 5 miles high on
Triton, proving Neptune's biggest moon is the solar system's third
object with active eruptions, scientists said Monday.
   ``We caught one in the act!'' said Ellis Miner, deputy Voyager
project scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   A NASA news release called the eruptions ``geyser-like
phenomenon.'' But with 5-mile-high plumes, they can be considered
either volcanoes or giant geysers, said Brad Smith, leader of
Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Earth and Io, a moon of Jupiter, are the only other bodies in
the solar system known to have active volcanoes. Io's volcanoes
spew molten sulfur.
   Images radioed to Earth when Voyager flew past Neptune and
Triton in August showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material
lying on Triton's south polar ice cap. At the time, scientists said
they believed the deposits were created by volcanoes spewing gas
and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said they believed the
volcanoes were active or had been active in the past few hundred
years.
   But it wasn't until late last week that closer examination of
Aug. 24 pictures taken from a distance of 62,000 miles revealed an
eruption in progress, Miner said Monday.
   ``Resembling a smokestack, the narrow stem of the dark plume
rises vertically nearly 5 miles, forming a cloud that drifts 90
miles eastward in Triton's winds,'' NASA said in a stratement.
   NASA made the announcement as Voyager formally ended its
two-month close inspection of Neptune, the solar system's
fourth-largest planet. The one-ton space probe was 34.7 million
miles past Neptune, traveling at 37,337 mph. It was 2.83 billion
miles from Earth, and had traveled 4.46 billion miles on a curved
course since its launch in 1977. Voyager 2 explored Jupiter in
1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune formally started Aug. 5 and
it will continue to look back at the planet until December.
   But the formal end of the encounter was marked by the activation
Monday of a new set of computer commands replacing the program that
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close
examination of Neptune.
   Voyager 2, like its twin Voyager 1, is expected to return
information to Earth for another 25 or 30 years before its
plutonium power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic
fields and electrically charged particles in space. Voyager 1
explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   The eruption isn't apparent in any single image of Triton, but
was ``recognized by examining several images taken from different
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques,'' NASA said.
   Triton's eruptions are of nitrogen ice with nitrogen gas, Smith
said.
   ``It's a semantic issue'' whether to call them volcanoes or
giant geysers, Smith said. ``If we're talking about the materials
involved, it's closer to a geyser than a volcano. But if you're
talking about the mechanics involved _ shooting material miles
above the surface _ that's closer to a volcano.''
   Scientists don't know what causes the eruptions on Triton, the
coldest known object in the solar system with a surface temperature
of 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   ``One possibility being considered is that pressurized gas,
probably nitrogen, rises from beneath the surface and carries aloft
dark particles and possibly ice crystals,'' NASA said. ``Whatever
the cause, the plume takes the particles to an altitude where they
are left suspended to form a cloud that drifts.''
   Triton is about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon.
   Voyager 2 also discovered gargantuan storms and 720-mph wind in
Neptune's atmosphere, and six moons orbiting the planet in addition
to Triton and Nereid, which were detected from Earth. It also
discovered three thin rings and one broad band of dust orbiting the
planet.

   Voyager 2 brushed by Neptune's north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked Triton, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' NASA said Friday.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m PDT Friday.
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told hundreds of scientists
and dignitaries Friday at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedingly
delighted to be here on this very historic day for America and
America's space program.''
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons in
addition to Nereid and frost-covered Triton, which were first
observed from Earth.
   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around
the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will
also prove to be a complete ring.
   Voyager's closest photos of Triton were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this weekend, but those returned Friday astounded
scientists. Soderblom said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone.
   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been
seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some other moons, ``it's the first
time we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one of
the huge craters on Triton. ``This is a real volcano.''
   But Stone noted that Triton's volcanoes are ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''
   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across.
   Other Triton photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying
cliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier
terrain,'' JPL scientist Torrence Johnson said. ``They're like
things you see in polar caps on Mars.''
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' Soderblom said, adding that the faults suggest
``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.
   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``erupted
plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys
or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is
``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''
Soderblom said.
   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices
and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.
   Earth and Jupiter's moon Io are the only objects in the solar
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active.
   Voyager also revealed Triton has an atmosphere, as predicted.
It's content wasn't immediately determined, but NASA said the haze
might be like photochemical smog.
   Stone said the discovery that Triton's surface once was
geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting
moon _ about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon _ once was a
comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around Neptune.
   Under that theory, Triton initially would have orbited Neptune in
a long ellipse, but Neptune's gravity slowly pulled it into a
circular orbit, making Triton a semi-molten, geologically active
ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Saturday, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from
Earth and 1.385 million miles from Neptune, speeding away from the
giant planet at 37,847 mph.
   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in Neptune's bluish
atmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands of
miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone
called the Great Dark Spot.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its trip to Neptune followed a
4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75
billion miles from Earth.
   Voyager 1 also was launched in 1977, exploring Jupiter in 1979
and Saturn in 1980 before speeding out of the plane of the planets.
   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends Oct. 2, Voyager
2 will look back over its shoulder at Neptune. Then it, like Voyager
1, will head toward interstellar space.
   ``Voyager 2 is now past Neptune and is continuing to press
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''
NASA administrator Richard Truly said. ``The Voyagers are destined
to wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they will
encounter.''
   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of NASA, called the
climax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time
we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the
reconnaissance of the planets, except Pluto.''

   A geyser-like volcano blasting nitrogen
ice and gas five miles high was photographed on Neptune's moon
Triton by Voyager 2 in the craft's last hurrah of its grand
solar-system tour.
   The discovery, announced Monday as Voyager 2 formally ended its
two-month encounter with Neptune, proves Triton is the solar
system's third known object with active eruptions, scientists said.
The others are Earth and Jupiter's moon Io, which has
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers.
   Photographs radioed to Earth when Voyager flew past Neptune and
Triton in August showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material
lying on Triton's south polar ice cap.
   At the time, scientists believed the deposits were created by
volcanoes spewing gas and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said
they believed the volcanoes were active or had been active during
the past few centuries.
   But it wasn't until late last week that closer examination of
pictures taken from 62,000 miles revealed an eruption in progress,
said Ellis Miner, deputy Voyager project scientist at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``We caught one in the act!'' he said.
   A National Aeronautics and Space Administration news release
called such eruptions ``geyser-like phenomena.''
   But Voyager's project scientist Edward Stone said, ``From the
standpoint of a major eruption, one would clearly discuss it as a
volcano.''
   He said a column of dark material rising five miles from the
surface can bee seen.
   On Earth, volcanoes erupt material that makes up the planet's
crust _ molten rock _ while geysers spew water.
   ``It's a semantic issue,'' said University of Arizona scientist
Brad Smith, head of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The eruption isn't apparent in any single image of Triton, but
was recognized by examining several images taken from different
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques, NASA said,
calling the discovery ``Voyager's last hurrah in its journey past
the planets.''
   Voyager 2's encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest
planet formally started Aug. 5 and ended Monday, when the one-ton
probe was 34.7 million miles past Neptune, traveling at 37,337 mph.
   The spacecraft was 2.83 billion miles from Earth, and traveled a
curved 4.46-billion-mile path since its launch in 1977. Voyager 2
explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   Although Voyager will continue to look back at Neptune until
December, Monday's formal end of the encounter was marked by the
activation of new computer commands replacing the program that
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close
examination of Neptune.
   Voyager 2, like its twin Voyager 1, is expected to return
information to Earth for 25 or 30 more years before its plutonium
power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic fields and
electrically charged particles in space as they search for the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980.
   Scientists don't know what causes the eruptions on Triton, which
is about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon and is the coldest
known object in the solar system, with a surface temperature of 400
degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Stone said one possibility is that heat from sunlight penetrates
and is trapped below Triton's polar ice, evaporating nitrogen ice
into gas that powers the eruptions.
   The active volcano is the third and apparently the only active
type of volcanism discovered on Triton.

   With Magellan safely in orbit around
Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the
spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped
the landscape of the hellishly hot planet.
   ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and
volcanoes,'' said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar
imaging system.
   Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal ``the
way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and
the way volcanoes work,'' said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mapping is set
to start next month.
   On Friday, Magellan plunged over the north pole of Venus, fired
its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges
from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface.
   ``We made it!'' said Carolynn Young, a Magellan project team
member. ``I had goose bumps from head to toe. It's wonderful.''
   The spacecraft successfully jettisoned the retrorocket Friday
night, laboratory spokesman Bob MacMillin said.
   He said engineers' plans for today included monitoring
Magellan's performance and collecting precise information on its
orbit _ details needed for successful mapping.
   Magellan's arrival at Venus broke a string of bad luck for NASA.
Hydrogen gas leaks have grounded the shuttle fleet temporarily and
a mirror focusing flaw severely impaired the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   Magellan is equipped with radar designed to peer through the
thick Venusian clouds and unveil the landscape of the second planet
from the sun. On Sept. 1, it will start mapping by bouncing radar
waves off Venus and capturing the echoes.
   NASA said the radar should be able to yield pictures and maps of
about 90 percent of Venus at a level of detail 10 times better than
in images produced by two Soviet Venera spacecraft that were
launched in 1983. It should be able to detect features as small as
about two football fields.
   ``It's like going to the Grand Canyon instead of having someone
tell you about it,'' mission analyst Rob Lock said.
   Magellan project manager Tony Spear said some worthwhile
pictures of Venus' surface may be produced by radar tests that
start next Thursday, but ``it is most likely in September ... that
we will get images of sufficient quality.''
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989,
starting a roundabout 948-million-mile journey to Venus. It met the
planet at a distance of 144 million miles from Earth.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor other than the moon, and is
similar to Earth in size, mass, density and position.
   Magellan may reveal similarities and differences between the two
planets, including whether any of Venus' volcanoes are active and
whether its surface features are formed by large-scale movements of
gigantic plates of rocky crust.
   It also will look for signs that the bone-dry planet may have
had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Saunders said
Magellan has no ability to determine what caused global warming on
Venus, but may find clues to when it started.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science,
called Magellan's arrival at Venus ``the beginning of one of the
most exciting eras of planetary exploration'' _ a period that
includes upcoming missions to Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, asteroids and
comets.
   Magellan was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since
Pioneers 12 and 13 were sent to Venus in 1978, and also the first
launched from a shuttle.
   Magellan, named for 16th century global circumnavigator
Ferdinand Magellan, is 21 feet long and 15 feet wide. After firing
the heavy fuel-filled braking rocket, its 3.7-ton weight dropped to
less than 1.5 tons, Spear said.

   Voyager 2 fired its thrusters Monday in a
delicate maneuver to bring it closer to Neptune's mysterious moon
Triton. Then it searched for northern lights over Neptune and
snapped pictures of its turbulent storms.
   One of two partial rings _ called ring arcs _ discovered earlier
this month by Voyager has not been seen in subsequent photographs,
leading scientists on a ``search for the lost arc,'' said Bradford
Smith, the head of the Voyager imaging team, which analyzes the
spacecraft's photographs.
   Scientists expect to find many ring arcs as they get closer to
the planet, and to obtain very detailed photographs of them, Smith
said in a press briefing at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Scientists issued their first weather forecast for Neptune,
predicting fairly accurately on Aug. 13 where Neptune's Great Dark
Spot _ an Earth-sized cyclone _ would be found Sunday.
   ``It's not perfect, but weather forecasting isn't a perfect
science,'' Smith said.
   The length of a day on Neptune _ the time the planet takes to
spin on its axis _ was estimated to be 16 hours, based on
observations of intense bursts of radio waves from the planet's
magnetic field, which varies with its rotation. Previous estimates
had put the day length at 17 or 18 hours.
   Voyager has so far discovered four new moons around Neptune,
bringing the total to six.
   The course correction executed Monday didn't use Voyager's main
thrusters, but two tiny thrusters that kept the spacecraft pointed
in the right direction to remain in communication with Earth. The
smaller thrusters also avoided heating that could have disrupted a
radio receiver that partly malfunctioned a year after Voyager was
launched in 1977.
   It was the first time such a maneuver had ever been performed,
the researchers said.
   Use of the main engine could have put mission controllers out of
touch with the spacecraft for up to two days, said Norman Haynes,
Voyager project manager. The controllers couldn't risk that with the
spacecraft's closest encounter with Neptune set for Thursday at 8:55
p.m. PDT.
   The spaceship will pass 3,000 miles from Neptune, and about
24,000 miles from Triton five hours later. The course correction
will bring the spacecraft 439 miles closer to Triton and will allow
better observations of any rings arcs and of the atmospheres of
Neptune and Triton.
   The latest pictures of Triton show the moon is brighter, cooler
and only about half the size scientists previously thought, Smith
said. Its diameter is now estimated at 1,740 miles, about
four-fifths the size of Earth's moon.
   The pictures show dark spots near Triton's equator and a pinkish
cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas, or methane,
falling to the moon's surface as a sludge, Smith said.
   Triton is a ``most intriguing moon,'' orbiting Neptune in a
backward direction, according to Voyager project scientist Edward
Stone. That suggests it may have been a giant comet that smacked
into some other moon of Neptune, then became trapped into orbit
around the planet.
   At 9 a.m. PDT Tuesday, Voyager will be 2.74 billion miles from
Earth and 2.29 million miles from Neptune, with a speed relative to
Neptune of 37,697 mph.
   Voyager's schedule of activities Monday including searching for
aurora, or northern lights, near Neptune's north pole; making 36
photographs of Neptune to study its weather, 24 pictures of Triton,
29 pictures of the moon Nereid and several photos of the recently
discovered moon designated 1989 N1.
   Last week, Voyager found evidence Neptune has a magnetic field,
suggesting it should also have auroral lights as electrically
charged particles are sucked toward its magnetic poles.
   The probe also was programmed to take 39 pictures of the region
in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   Pictures taken Monday were being recorded on tape aboard Voyager
for transmission back to Earth later in the week.
   Voyager's Monday schedule also included using an infrared sensor
to study composition of Neptune's atmosphere.

   Voyager 2 plunged over Neptune's north
pole and today took its closest look at the moon Triton, discovering
dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults
and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic
exploration of four planets.
   ``This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory
astronomer Rich Terrile said after the 12-year-old spaceship made
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. Neptune ``is not
a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real
place.''
   The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above Neptune's icy
north pole cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. PDT Thursday _ the closest of its
planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by Neptune's gravity
to a speed of 61,148 mph.
   Its photos of Triton revealed that Neptune's major moon has
large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said
Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.
   ``It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a
moon of Uranus, Stone said. ``This is a real volcano.''
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said today in a speech to
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Reiterating President Bush's July statement in support of an
eventual permanent base on the Earth's moon and a manned trip to
Mars, Quayle declared: ``We Americans have been opening new
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so.
Today, space is America's frontier.''
   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, called the climax of the
Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time we're seeing a
planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the
planets, except Pluto.''
   Five hours after the rendezvous with Neptune, the spaceship made
its closest pass by the moon Triton at 2:10 a.m., a flyby that was
confirmed when signals reached Earth at 6:16 a.m. PDT.
   The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's
radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to Earth.
   The array of information on Neptune's largest moon had
scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about Neptune
itself.
   ``Triton will upstage Neptune. It's filled with hummocky,
rippling terrain,'' Terrile said.
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' said Laurence Soderblom, of the U.S. Geological Survey. The
faults suggest that ``Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time
on the moon.
   Later, Joseph Boyce, a NASA geologist, said there was ``abundant
evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like
substance rather than molten rock.
   Voyager's newest photos of Triton received this morning showed a
smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that Boyce said
measured several hundred miles across.
   ``It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,''
Boyce said. ``It looks like some sort of feature flooded by
material, and the material is probably volcanic material.''
   The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows
on Uranus' moon Ariel in 1986, and earlier found active
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of Jupiter.
   Boyce emphasized there is no evidence yet that Triton's icy
volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the
crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so.
   Earlier, Bradford Smith, head of Voyager's photographic imaging
team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had described Triton's
surface in photos taken Thursday as ``extremely strange and
puzzling.''
   The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and
``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist
Torrence Johnson said.
   While difficult to interpret, the early photos of Triton gave
``the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and
alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white
topography that is ``closer to flat than big mountains,'' said
Smith, who called the pictures ``Just short of spectacular.''
   At 11:59 p.m. PDT, signals were received showing that Voyager had
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it
passed through the plane containing Neptune's rings, said Donald
Gurnett. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the
spacecraft, Gurnett said.
   Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the
spaceship's near encounter with Neptune, Smith said.
   ``There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. ``We are all very
excited.''
   Scientists announced Thursday that Voyager discovered two more
tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a
60-mile-wide moon designated 1989 N5, and the even smaller 1989 N6,
which is a mere 30 miles wide.
   That brought the number of Neptune's moons discovered before the
close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from
Earth _ Triton and Nereid _ and four found earlier by Voyager.
   Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling Neptune,
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc.
Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from
Neptune almost certainly also is a complete ring.
   During its flight past Neptune and Triton, Voyager was programmed
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study
their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the
rings and search for others; and take its best but still
2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid.
   Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of
Neptune's atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds,
high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other
cyclones.
   NASA calculated Voyager's position during the Neptune flyby as
nearly 2.75 billion miles from Earth. But the ship had traveled a
curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in
1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   Champagne flowed at the laboratory Thursday when Voyager crossed
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets Neptune's
magnetic field.
   Earlier pictures of Triton suggested the backward-orbiting moon
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural
gas on its pink-and-blue surface.
   Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry
to aim a space probe built with 1960s technology, NASA engineers
said Thursday they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was
supposed to be after the long journey.
   ``Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer.
   Voyager 1 visited Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and now is
speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after
it stops studying Neptune on Oct. 2.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but Pluto's
elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making Neptune temporarily
the solar system's outmost planet.
   ``Someday there ought to be a Pluto flyby,'' Fisk said. ``But
there are no active plans to do that.''

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Up to four more active ice volcanoes on
Neptune's moon Triton were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager
2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the
fastest yet seen in the solar system.
   Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly
five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of
Triton, ``chances are that there are a dozen of these things going
off globally'' at any time, said Torrence Johnson, a planetary
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2
after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug.
24-25 flight past Neptune and Triton.
   Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced Tuesday
during a news conference at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Triton is only the third world in the solar system known to have
active volcanism. The others are Earth and Jupiter's moon Io, which
has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are
volcanoes on cloud-shrouded Venus.
   Neptune's jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas
past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like
Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in
Neptune's atmosphere.
   ``These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the
previous record winds of 1,100 mph in Saturn's jet stream, Stone
said. ``These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is
Mach 1.''
   The speed of sound on Earth is about 700 mph, depending on
temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in Earth's air.
   The clouds racing in Neptune's winds could be seen in a movie
made by computer from still photographs taken by Voyager. Also
shown at Tuesday's news conference was another computer movie
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on Triton,
Neptune's largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar
system.
   The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts
back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud
also is visible.
   The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three
more plumes, Johnson said.
   When Voyager swept past Triton early Aug. 25, scientists saw
streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what
they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced it
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic
analysis of the photos.
   But the images were so fuzzy ``you had to take our word for
it,'' Johnson said.
   So NASA used a computer to overlap still photos taken from
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes.
   The causes of Triton's nitrogen ice volcanoes and Neptune's high
winds are mysterious.
   Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material
settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent
nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker
material beneath. But the heat cannot escape through the ice, so
some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build
until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark
material with it.
   Neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than Earth. Scientists are
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from Neptune's
formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot,
not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15
and 20 degrees south latitude, Stone said.
   Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in
the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is
needed to power high winds, he said.
   Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission
in which it flew past Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The spacecraft
discovered six moons at Neptune, bringing the total to eight, and
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30
times farther from the sun than Earth.

   The spacecraft Magellan bombarded Venus
with radar Saturday in the first attempt to make pictures of the
planet's cloud-shrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost
touch with it last month.
   ``Most people are sighing with relief,'' said Jim Scott,
Magellan mission director at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're just happy to
get into the position where we wanted to be.''
   Acting on computerized commands radioed 154.9 million miles from
Earth, Magellan started bouncing radar off the planet during the
morning and engineers received confirmation 13 minutes later, Scott
said.
   NASA's Deep Space Network tracking station at Goldstone, Calif.,
started receiving data on the radar images, and computers will
assemble it into pictures that will be released to the public early
this week, said Ed Sherry, technical assistant to Magellan's
project manager.
   ``I'm just delighted. I'm happy as a clam,'' he said.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of Venus' surface, totally concealed by
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet. It was launched from
the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, and started orbiting
Venus on Aug. 10, after a looping 948 million-mile voyage from
Earth.
   The spacecraft's radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which reached Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Engineers lost radio contact with Magellan for 14 hours starting
Aug. 16, then for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21. They still haven't
learned the cause of the temporary blackouts, which they believe
could happen again.
   But they gave Magellan new computer instructions so it can
recover quickly from future communications breakdowns.
   The Aug. 16 blackout happened only hours after Magellan used its
radar for its first pictures of Venus during two orbits around the
planet. Only 1{ orbits worth of picture information was sent to
Earth before contact was lost.
   Half the remaining picture information was radioed to Earth on
Wednesday and the rest was sent back Saturday before mapping
resumed, Scott said.
   The first pictures showed Venus has large flows of solidified
lava; pervasive ``Venusquake'' faults; big meteorite impact
craters; volcanic cinder cones; large collapsed volcanic craters,
called calderas; and parallel mountain ridges and valleys like
those in the Great Basin that covers most of Nevada and western
Utah.
   NASA's official position is that Magellan's formal mapping
mission won't begin until late this month. But if all goes well
through the weekend, officials may decide afterward that the
243-day mapping effort began Saturday, Scott and Sherry said.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, rotates once on its axis
every 243 Earth days. Magellan circles Venus in a nearly polar
orbit, so as Venus revolves beneath it the craft should be able to
map 70 percent to 90 percent of the planet during its 243-day
mission. NASA, however, has said it expects to use Magellan for
additional 243-day cycles so the entire planet can be mapped.
   Venus is considered Earth's virtual twin in terms of size, mass,
density and distance from the sun, although the planet's surface
has been heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a runaway ``greenhouse
effect.''
   Magellan's goal to learn exactly what forces shape Venus, and
whether its crust is broken into giant drifting plates like those
that carry continents across the face of the Earth.
   Many scientists believe Venusian crustal movements are
predominated by ``hot spots'' - rising subterranean plumes of
molten rock like those that created the Hawaiian Islands.

   Voyager's pictures of Neptune's moon
Triton _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, NASA says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said Rich Terrile,
an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone said Monday.
   Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that Triton is
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that Neptune
has something in common with Los Angeles: smog.
   Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to Neptune
last Thursday and zipped past Triton on Friday, scientists
recognized that the frosty surface of Neptune's largest moon
reflected much more light than originally expected, said Mary Beth
Murrill, a JPL spokeswoman.
   Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68
seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of Triton, Murrill
said.
   Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas,
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square
miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen
particles 20 miles skyward.
   During its Neptune encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six
moons in addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from
Earth. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad
rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   NASA engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said Lanny Miller, manager of the flight
engineering office.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 4.55 million miles behind Neptune, speeding toward the
edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph.
   Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined Triton's surface
temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon
``the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said Roger
Yelle of the University of Arizona.
   Scientists believe Pluto and its moon Charon are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   Voyager also found smog on Neptune.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's
atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of
photochemical smog at the bottom of Neptune's stratosphere, said Jim
Pollock, an imaging team member from NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif.
   ``Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an
atmosphere,'' imaging team leader Bradford Smith said of other
planets and moons.
   ``In Los Angeles, the problem is it's happening way down low
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen
except on Titan,'' he said, referring to Saturn's smoggy moon.
   In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon
1989 N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its
lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1,
one of the six moons discovered by Voyager since June, Smith said.
   Voyager found earlier that 1989 N1 really is Neptune's
second-largest moon after Triton. Scientists previously thought
Nereid was No. 2.
   Instruments aboard Voyager discovered Neptune is encircled by
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape,
called a torus.
   The torus is created by gases coming off of Triton, said Ralph
McNutt, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jupiter is
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur
volcanoes on the Jovian moon Io.
   The space probe also found Neptune and Triton have auroras
vaguely like Earth's northern and southern lights. They glow in
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however,
unlike Earth's visible auroras.
   Voyager's close encounter with Neptune last week capped its epic
tour of the four outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus. The probe was launched in 1977 along with its twin, Voyager
1, which explored only Jupiter and Saturn.

   Atlantis' astronauts, safely in
orbit after a cliff-hanger weather delay, sent the Magellan
spacecraft streaking across the solar system Thursday night on a
$550 million mapmaking mission to Venus.
   The robot spacecraft, reviving an American planetary-science
program dormant for a decade, slipped from the shuttle's cargo bay
at 9:01 p.m. EDT and drifted into space.
   ``Magellan is deployed,'' reported shuttle commander David
Walker.
   An hour later, after Atlantis moved a safe distance away, both
stages of a spacecraft motor fired to start Magellan on a 456-day
journey to Venus, 158 million miles away. It will travel 806
million miles, looping 1{ times around the sun, before reaching and
orbiting its target in August 1990.
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
Magellan's mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
Walker replied when told both stages had fired.
   Minutes later Mission Control reported:
   ``Magellan is coming to life and is on a proper path toward
Venus, falling toward the sun.''
   Mission specialists Mark Lee and Mary Cleave, operating remote
controls inside the shuttle cabin, checked the health of the space
probe before sending a signal that spring-ejected it into its own
orbit while Atlantis soared over the Pacific Ocean 600 miles
southwest of Los Angeles.
   Magellan, the first planetary craft ever launched from a
shuttle, is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' cloud-shrouded
surface. Its high-resolution radar system is expected to produce
images of objects as small as a football field _ 10 times the
clarity of any previous pictures of the mysterious planet.
   The release of Magellan, the main task of the four-day flight,
came a little more than six hours after Atlantis thundered into
orbit 184 miles high.
   The launch was delayed 59 minutes by shifting clouds and winds
that had threatened the second postponement in six days. When
Atlantis finally left its pad, just five minutes remained in the
launch ``window'' dictated by the need to have the shuttle in the
proper position to dispatch Magellan to Venus.
   The launch team had advanced the countdown to the 5-minute mark
and held there, waiting for a break in the clouds that obscured a
runway near the launch pad where Atlantis would land in an
emergency.
   Chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying a weather scout plane,
found a break, signaled the go-ahead, and the count was started and
carried down to the blazing liftoff.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger. I'm glad you stuck with it,''
acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers said as he congratulated
the launch team.
   It was the 60th U.S. man-in-space flight, the 29th for the
shuttle and the fourth since the Challenger explosion more than
three years ago.
   ``Four of us are very happy to be back in space, and the fifth
one is very happy to be here,'' radioed Walker.
   Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Cleave and
Norman Thagard flew on previous shuttle flights. Lee is a rookie.
   ``Did somebody win the pool up there?'' mission control
commentator John Creighton asked the crew. ``We had only five
minutes left in the window.''
   ``We wouldn't want to push it any closer,'' replied Walker.
   The commander also reported Atlantis' separation from its
external fuel tank as it entered orbit was rougher than he
remembered on his first shuttle flight.
   ``It was more violent _ although I hate to use that word,'' he
said. ``It wasn't the soft separation I remembered from the
previous flight.''
   A launch attempt last Friday was halted with just 31 seconds to
go because of a short circuit in an engine fuel pump. Technicians
worked around the clock over the weekend to replace the pump and a
fuel line. NASA had to launch Magellan by May 28 or ground it for
two years until Earth and Venus were again in the proper alignment.
   Among tens of thousands who watched the rare afternoon liftoff
were some of the country's most renowned planetary scientists. They
have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978,
when Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last U.S. planetary
expedition.
   Success for Magellan would signal the start of a science-rich
three-year period during which five major probes will be rocketed
into space.
   ``The overture, the symphony, begins with Magellan,'' said NASA
science chief Lennard Fisk. ``It's going to be a long symphony.
It's going to have a lot of crescendos ... Nobody is going to
question our leadership in planetary science again.''
   Fisk hailed Magellan's flight as the start of a ``second golden
age'' of space science. The first was the period from the mid-1960s
to the late-1970s when unmanned spacecraft for the first time were
launched to make closeup examinations of Venus, Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Looking ahead, Fisk said that in August the Voyager 2 spacecraft
launched in 1977 will take the first close look at Neptune after a
planetary odyssey that earlier took it near Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus.
   In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo probe
on its way to Jupiter, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, Ulysses is to orbit the sun
in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.
   The planetary program had languished for 11 years because of a
combination of NASA budget cuts and the Challenger explosion that
delayed most of these missions more than three years.
   When Magellan reaches Venus in August 1990, it is to fire into
orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist.
   The radar is designed to pierce Venus sulfuric acid clouds and
produce images showing features as small as 100 yards across, the
size of a football field. In comparison, two 1983 Soviet spacecraft
captured features about 1,200 yards across and the 1978
Pioneer-Venus could not distinguish anything smaller than 60 miles
across.
   ``Everything we have learned about planetary science says that
Venus is the planet most like Earth,'' Saunders said. ``A major
question is why Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though
at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.''
   The surface temperature of Earth's sultry twin is 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure
is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   The atmosphere of Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide,
and the upper clouds, which hide the planet from view, are made up
of sulfuric acid droplets. Earlier exploration by unmanned
spacecraft have revealed continent-sized plateaus, deep canyons and
one of the highest mountains in the solar system.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.

MAGELLAN PROBE MANEUVERS INTO ORBIT OF VENUS

After its 15-month journey from Earth, the Magellan spacecraft, a planetary 
probe cobbled together from leftover pieces of other projects, slipped into a 
perfect orbit around Venus Friday morning, providing NASA with an emotional 
high in its long summer of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver required the spacecraft to fire its solid-rocket motor while it 
was behind Venus and out of touch with human controllers at Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. Project scientists spent a tense 21 minutes until the spacecraft 
emerged again at 10:06 a.m., signaling a successful firing and precipitating 
high fives, bearhugs and prolonged clapping. Had the solid rocket not fired, 
the craft would have sailed past the planet at 25,000 miles per hour and been 
lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, Magellan will start radar mapping the cloud-shrouded surface 
of our sister planet, painting a portrait more detailed than what is available 
even for much of the Earth, which is shielded from such mapping by its oceans. 
At its low point, the spacecraft will sweep within 186 miles of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The flight to the hot, dry planet and insertion into orbit went so smoothly, 
JPL researchers said, that Magellan was left with a large excess of fuel for 
its maneuvering rockets, enough to keep it in operation for 30 years, decades 
longer than had been projected. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is the first of several planetary probes already launched or in 
preparation that will give the United States operating observatories around 
other objects in the solar system -- including Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, asteroids 
and comets -- well into the next century. "We are back in the planetary 
exploration business," said JPL's Steve Wall. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after the successful rocket firing, NASA associate 
administrator Lennard A. Fisk shrugged off questions about NASA's short-term 
grounding of its shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks. Instead he focused on 
the successful Venus flyby of Galileo earlier this year, the launches of the 
Cosmic Background Explorer observatory last November and the Gamma-Ray 
Observatory in June and the upcoming launch of Ulysses into a solar orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is not the first spacecraft to reach Venus. Soviet and American probes 
have preceded it, and two of the Soviet probes even landed on the surface, 
transmitting pictures of a parched, cracked landscape. But those pictures only 
covered the area immediately surrounding the craft's landing site. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have also used cloud-piercing radar to map the upper quarter of the 
planet, and U.S. scientists have employed the massive Arecibo radio observatory 
to map the entire planet, but only very crudely. In both cases, the resolution 
was sufficient only to pick out objects the size of 10 football fields, just 
enough "to whet our appetites," said JPL's Bob MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan, in contrast, will be able to image objects the size of a single 
football field, providing unprecedented clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope that by observing Venus in great detail, they will be able to 
learn about not only its past but Earth's as well. Venus is very nearly Earth's 
twin in size, but its surface temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and its 
atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth, indicating that two planets 
took different paths in a very early stage of planetary evolution. 
</P>
<P>
The sweltering temperature of Venus is caused by the high concentration of 
carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, which permits the sun's heat to pass through 
and warm the planet but prevents heat from escaping back into space. 
Researchers are predicting a similar, albeit less disastrous, "greenhouse 
effect" on Earth because of continued release of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"From looking at places like Venus, we can . . . know more about what might 
happen on Earth," said Gentry Lee of JPL. 
</P>
<P>
But geologists are especially interested in studying the surface of Venus, 
which "is completely unlike anything seen on Earth or Mars," according to JPL's 
Stephen Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist. Because so much of the Earth's 
crust is obscured by oceans, geologists have a hard time interpreting many of 
its features. The study of Venus should give insight into Earth's crustal 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know a lot more about that planet to understand our own," Saunders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers will have to wait a little longer. Spacecraft controllers will 
spend the next three weeks checking Magellan's systems and flexing its radar 
unit. The actual mapping will begin Aug. 29 if no adjustment to its orbit is 
necessary, as now seems likely, or Sept. 1 if adjustment is required. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan will spend about a third of each 3.2-hour orbit mapping a narrow swath 
of Venus about 16 miles wide. During the remainder of the orbit, the data will 
be radioed to Earth. The spacecraft will require one Venus day -- 243 Earth 
days -- to map about 80% of its surface, all but the south pole. 
</P>
<P>
During that phase, Magellan will radio back to Earth more data than all the 
previous planetary probes combined. 
</P>
<P>
Following this primary mission, the spacecraft will enter an extended mission 
in which it will map the remaining 20% of the planet and go back over 
interesting parts of the surface to provide stereoscopic images. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite and its operation for the next year will cost NASA $551 million. 
Counting the cost of its launch by the shuttle Atlantis, the total cost of the 
mission is $744 million. An additional $169 million will be necessary to keep 
it in operation through 1995.

   The shuttle Atlantis and its five
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission
to start a robot craft streaking toward Venus, the cloud-shrouded
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists.
   The crew finished final spacecraft checks and NASA officials
said the space probe called Magellan was ready as the 23-minute
launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no
earlier than 2:24 p.m.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said launch of the
explorer craft Magellan will mark ``a resurgence of America's
planetary program.'' The last American probe to deep space was
dispatched in 1978.
   Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began Tuesday. A
launch control commentator announced ``all conditions look good''
for launch time weather in Florida. Officials kept close watch on
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at 2:24 p.m. EDT, heading to
orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above Earth.
   Launch pad workers completed fueling early this morning. After
breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits
they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to NASA workers
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad.
   Magellan is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours
after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile
unmanned trip of its own.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave and Mark Lee will operate remote
controls that propel Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Atlantis is commanded by David M. Walker. The other crew members
are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard.
   The liftoff opportunity, dictated by Magellan's path to Venus
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23
minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history.
   After its release from the shuttle, Magellan's own rocket will
send it out of Earth orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will
fly around the sun 1{ times before settling into an orbit of Venus
in August 1990.
   Venus has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward
and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar ``star'' of
the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after
sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million
miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets
since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily:
Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke Venus, which has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead.
   Magellan will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet.
   An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the
surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.
The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the
Venusian surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then
sending the image back to Earth for computer enhancements.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of the surface
while orbiting Venus for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single
Venus day.
   The last U.S. planetary probe was the Pioneer-Venus, launched in
1978.
   Fisk said that in the 11 years since, ``we had a planetary
program that was in danger of being an also-ran.''
   Magellan is the first in a series of American planetary
exploration missions.
   Voyager 2, a probe launched in 1977 and an earlier visitor to
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, will fly past Neptune in August. In
October, the robot craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A
space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to
the sun in October 1990, and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' Fisk said at a Thursday news conference.
   Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of Venus and until the
Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space
probes have been sent to Venus, including four by the United
States, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been
photographed.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the Magellan
studies may help scientists understand how the Earth developed into
a place where life flourishes while Venus became a world of torrid
heat.

Every once in a while, a clever screenwriter reminds us that when we peer up at 
some distant star or planet, we are actually looking into the past because the 
light thrown off by the celestial body takes so long to travel to us here on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
On public-television stations around the country tonight, would-be astronomers 
and insomniacs alike can spend the wee hours looking at close-up photographs of 
Neptune's recent past as Voyager 2 zips past the planet and its moons at 38,000 
m.p.h., snapping pictures like a shutter-happy tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling at the speed of light, the signals that make up those photographs 
will take four hours and six minutes to traverse the 2.7 billion miles 
separating Neptune and Earth. And just as soon as the signals are received by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's deep space tracking 
antennas in California, Spain and Australia and then turned into photographs by 
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, viewers will be able 
to see them on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic slide show begins at 11:30 p.m. on KCET Channel 28, at 11 p.m. on 
KVCR Channel 24 and at 12:25 a.m. on KPBS Channel 15, and will continue until 
at least 4 a.m. Friday. Anyone willing to stay up will get the first look at 
these pictures from deep space just hours after the 1-ton Voyager spacecraft 
makes its closest pass over the clouds of Neptune, turns 45 degrees with the 
help of the planet's gravity and then flies past Neptune's quirky moon, Triton. 
Voyager is scheduled to buzz within 3,000 miles of Neptune's wispy cloud tops 
tonight at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on Voyager's close encounter with Neptune, the pale-blue eighth planet 
from the sun that was discovered in 1846, will also be carried throughout the 
night on Cable News Network and C-SPAN. CNN will have extended live coverage of 
the mission beginning at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
During its 4.4-billion mile, circuitous journey through the solar system, 
Voyager 2 has already photographed Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Tonight's 
meeting with Neptune, which is four times the size of Earth, will be Voyager's 
final visit to a planetary system before it darts off into the infinity of 
space. Scientists hope that Voyager will provide the first direct measurements 
of the environment outside the solar system sometime in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
PBS' "Neptune All Night" will feature 20-minute updates each hour from NASA and 
JPL scientists as they examine and interpret the most recent photographs. The 
remaining 40 minutes each hour will originate live from WHYY-TV in Philadelphia 
and will include a panel of experts on the East Coast and at JPL analyzing the 
new data, live viewer calls on a nationwide toll-free hot line, reaction to the 
Neptune voyage from science-fiction writers and celebrities, a recap of 
Voyager's previous planetary encounters and a frivolous look at space travel in 
movies and science-fiction literature. 
</P>
<P>
"We are staying on the air all night to present this program because there 
really has been a rebirth in public interest in the space program," said Don 
Leifer, program director at KVCR in San Bernardino. "We literally had a block 
party on my street with all the people watching the lunar eclipse (last week). 
This show is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. It's the first time anyone 
will have seen such close-up pictures of Neptune, and we felt this falls 
exactly into where public television should go." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Edward Stone, Voyager's chief project scientist, called the 
meeting with Neptune "the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer 
planets, and like a symphony, its tempo is accelerating as it nears the end." 
</P>
<P>
Already Voyager has discovered four previously unknown Neptunian moons, a 
complete ring and several partial rings circling the planet, a huge storm 
system the size of the Earth that may pack winds up to 400 m.p.h. and a strong 
magnetic field. JPL scientists expect further discoveries today as the 
spacecraft sails through the upper reaches of Neptune's atmosphere and then 
within 2,500 miles of Triton, the moon that revolves the "wrong" way and 
appears to have a transparent atmosphere and a pinkish, iced surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It may snow from time to time in places, there may be heavy frost laid down," 
astronomer Bradford Smith said of the eccentric satellite. "What we would 
really like to do is to get some idea of what Triton's geological history has 
been. It's a strange satellite, it's in the wrong orbit, it's going backward 
around Neptune, and something truly catastrophic must have happened at some 
time in its past." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's snapshots of Neptune can also be seen on the NASA-Select satellite 
feed by anyone with their own satellite dish, on some cable-access channels and 
at various locations around the Southland. The NASA-Select feed will contain 
fresh images from space as well as NASA and JPL press conferences and 
discussions of the mission and the spacecraft's discoveries. The NASA feed will 
begin at 9 a.m. today and continue through the night, and also will be 
broadcast from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The NASA-Select feed can be seen at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry, the Griffith Park Observatory, Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in San 
Diego, the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Cal State Long Beach, El 
Camino College, San Diego State, Santa Monica College, UCLA, USC, Ambassador 
College, Southwestern College and on some cable systems. Interested viewers 
should call their cable operators for details. 
</P>
<P>
The Learning Channel will also offer a one-hour progress report on Voyager 
today at 5 p.m. CNN will air a special report, "Voyager: Rendezvous With 
Neptune," Saturday at 5 a.m. And TBS will carry its own special on Voyager at 7 
p.m. Sunday, hosted by Carl Sagan and Sidney Poitier.

   Some statistics known about Neptune as
Voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight:
   DIAMETER: About 30,700 miles, nearly four time's Earth's diameter
and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus,
which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31,760 miles.
   MOONS: Two majorones, Triton and Nereid, plus at least four
others discovered so far by Voyager 2. Triton, four-fifths the size
of Earth's moon, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit
a planet backwards. That suggests it once was a sun-orbiting comet
that hit a Neptunian moon and was ``captured'' into orbit around
Neptune.
   RINGS: So far Voyager has found Neptune is orbited by one
complete ring of debris, and one ring arc, or partial ring, which
scientists believe also may prove to be a complete ring upon closer
inspection.
   DAY LENGTH: Surface wind suggests Neptune takes nearly 18 hours
to spin on its axis, but Voyager's measurements indicate a day on
Neptune is closer to 16 hours, the time it takes for the bulk of the
planet's interior to rotate.
   YEAR LENGTH: Neptune takes 165 Earth years to make a single orbit
around the sun. That means a winter on Neptune lasts more than 40
Earth years.
   DISTANCE FROM SUN: Orbits the sun at an average distance of 2.793
billion miles, 30 times as far as Earth and invisible to the naked
eye from Earth. Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun,
but because of Pluto's elongated orbit it is now the ninth and
outermost.
   WEATHER: A chilly 307 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at an
altitude where the atmospheric pressure is twice that at sea level
on Earth. Voyager has revealed cirrus-like clouds, 400-mph wind and
an Earth-sized cyclone and other storms in Neptune's atmosphere. The
source of the internal heat creating Neptune's weather is a mystery;
Earth's comes from decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   ATMOSPHERE: Primarily hydrogen and helium, but Neptune appears
pale blue-green because enough methane, the major component of
natural gas, is present to absorb red light.
   STRUCTURE: Scientists suspect that a third of the way toward
Neptune's center the atmosphere gives way to a slurry of water and
rock, with no distinct sky-sea boundary.
   DISCOVERY: In 1846, by Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis
d'Arrest at the Berlin Observatory. Neptune was discovered because
its presence was predicted based on disturbances in Uranus' orbit.

VENUS BARES ITS SOUL IN NEW RADAR IMAGES; 
</P>

SPACE: LATEST PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW CRATERS LARGE ENOUGH TO SWALLOW LOS ANGELES. JPL 
SCIENTISTS SEARCH FOR CLUES TELLING WHY PLANET TURNED OUT TO BE SO DIFFERENT

Venus, a planet that started out like the Earth but took a dramatic turn 
somewhere along the way, is turning out to be a geological candy store as it 
lays bare its soul for the Magellan spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs released Tuesday by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory show a planet 
that is pockmarked with giant impact craters large enough to swallow Los 
Angeles and a twisted, tormented landscape that has been molded by forces that 
are still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely jazzy images," said Gordon H. Pettengill of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, principal investigator for Magellan's 
radar science team. The images were captured by an electronic "camera" that 
uses radar beams to pierce through the dense atmosphere that normally hides the 
surface of the hot, barren planet. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that Magellan will help them understand why Venus -- the planet 
that is most like the Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun -- turned 
out to be so different: devoid of life, with surface temperatures hot enough to 
melt lead and a heavy atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
After a troubled beginning, Magellan seems to be doing its best to help unravel 
the mysteries, but some of the images produce more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has mapped the surface for more than 80 orbits as it flies in a 
polar trajectory around Venus. The problems that caused the craft to sever its 
communications with Earth twice are not fully understood, said chief engineer 
John P. Slonski Jr., so Magellan is not completely safe yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems may happen again," Slonski told a press conference at the 
Pasadena lab. He said that even if the "root cause" of the blackouts has not 
been determined, engineers have at least narrowed the range of probabilities 
and taken steps to protect Magellan as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said Tuesday that the images captured by Magellan have demonstrated 
that Venus is an extraordinary laboratory in which to test geological theories 
because the photographs are clear and reveal a geological record spanning 
hundreds of millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth, the evidence of earthquakes and volcanoes disappears over time 
because of vegetation and erosion. On Venus, where there is no vegetation and 
very little erosion, the geological record stands out in brilliant clarity. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new images shows an extraordinary pattern of what appears to be a 
crosshatching of faults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely regular pattern," said James W. Head II of Brown University, 
co-investigator on the radar science team. "The regularity is so remarkable," 
he said, that "we have no idea how these (patterns) would form." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that there are similar areas on Earth, he said, but they must be 
hidden by vegetation or erosion. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, "erosion does not appear to be a fundamental process" on the 
surface of Venus, Head said. That is because there is no water to wash away the 
soil and produce sediments that could be transported by the wind, and the wind 
amounts to little more than a slight breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so used to water eroding the surface of Earth," Head said. "It's 
astonishing to see all this detail. When you create (a geological feature on 
Venus) it stays there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
If Magellan can capture a photo of an active volcano on Venus, it would answer 
whether the planet is alive in a volcanic sense, but nothing in the images 
transmitted to Earth shows that. 
</P>
<P>
Head pointed out that Magellan has covered only 1 1/2% of the surface of Venus 
so far. If you looked at that much of the Earth's surface, you probably would 
not see any active volcanoes either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Head indicated that he believes he already knows the answer. "It's very much 
alive," he said of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The images from Magellan reveal a surface that could be changing even as the 
spacecraft zips overhead. In addition to faulting and cratering, the newly 
released images show a "river" of lava hundreds of miles long. The images also 
show giant volcanoes similar to those in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular image is a mosaic covering an area about half the size of 
California. It was displayed at JPL as a 10-foot-by-12-foot mural, and it shows 
giant craters up to 30 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
One image shows an impact crater that is nearly two miles deep. All of the 
impact craters are at least five miles in diameter. Scientists said that is 
because only the largest objects survive the long journey through space to 
Venus' surface. Smaller meteoroids apparently break up as they crash through 
the dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is expected to spend nearly a year mapping Venus, and scientists said 
Tuesday that they expect far more images and a lot of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't touch that dial," Head said. "We think we've got a blockbuster fall 
season coming up."

   The Magellan spacecraft found that
600-mile-wide circular features on Venus are mile-high volcanic
bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet, a
scientist said Wednesday.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like nested sets of
concentric rings. Called coronas, the rings are ridges and valleys
that form huge circles. Numerous volcanoes and lava flows dot the
coronas.
   The coronas are formed by the same kind of upwelling of
underground plumes of molten rock that created the Hawaiian
Islands, said Ellen Stofan, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They're definitely formed by some sort of thermal pulse from
the interior of the planet'' that lasts hundreds of millions of
years, she said.
   In 1983 and 1984, the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
identified about 30 coronas that measure from 75 miles to more than
600 miles across. But the Venera orbiters couldn't determine if
they were upward bulges or depressions in the ground caused by the
impacts of gargantuan meteorites.
   Magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated
radar, which makes much more detailed pictures and also is able to
calculate surface topography. It found five more coronas and
determined they rise as much as one mile above the surrounding
terrain. Stofan said that shows they are hot spots rather than
impact craters.
   One corona that's 150 miles wide seems to be in the early stages
of bulging upward, suggesting that some of its small volcanic domes
and lava flows may be actively erupting, she said.
   Magellan won't be able to confirm the presence of active
volcanoes until the middle of next year, when it passes over the
same part of Venus a second time and can look for landscape changes
resulting from any ongoing eruptions.
   NASA engineers, meanwhile, said the sun will almost block
Earth's view of Magellan and Venus on Nov. 1 when Venus, the sun
and Earth will be oriented in almost a straight line.
   That will cause a nine-day halt - starting sometime between
Saturday and Monday - in Magellan's use of radar to peer through
Venus' clouds and map the planet, said Phil Allin, administrative
assistant to Magellan's project manager.
   The astronomical lineup, called ``superior conjunction,'' also
may make NASA completely lose contact with Magellan for up to three
days, although engineers disagree on whether that will happen,
Allin said.
   The sun won't completely block Earth's view of Venus and
Magellan during the planetary lineup, but activity from the sun
already has impaired some communications, he said.
   Engineers twice lost touch with Magellan in August due to a
yet-unidentified problem. If that happens again when the
Venus-sun-Earth alignment also makes communication difficult or
impossible, ``we worry about how quickly we would get things back
to normal,'' Allin said.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, and arrived at the second planet from the sun on Aug. 10.

<HEAD>Space Probe Finds Three More Moons Orbiting Neptune</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three new moons were discovered around
Neptune by cameras on the Voyager 2 space probe as it hurtled
toward the blue planet, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists said
Thursday.
   The discoveries bring the number of known Neptune moons to six,
including long-known Triton and Nereid and a moon found earlier
this summer by Voyager.
   Voyager 2 was 22 million miles from Neptune when the moons were
confirmed by scientists Wednesday, indicating there may be many
more discoveries as the space probe draws closer in the next few
weeks.
   Finding the moons may presage discovery of narrow rings around
Neptune similar to those around Saturn. That is because the moons
are orbiting in a region where rings are thought to exist, said
Richart Terrile, one of the team of scientists studying images
transmitted by Voyager.
   ``The whole ring arc idea has it that satellites will be in
association with the rings, and the fact we're seeing the moons
already is encouraging,'' Richard Terrile, using a term for partial
rings.
   The new moons were temporarily named 1989 N2, 1989 N3 and 1989
N4. The objects were spotted in images from Voyager's TV cameras
and tracked for five days. They were confirmed as moons when they
followed predicted orbits.
   The trio appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in
diameter and are in circular, equatorial orbits moving in the same
direction as Neptune's rotation. Triton, for unknown reasons,
orbits in the opposite direction.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and has explored Jupiter, Saturn
and Uranus. Now 2.7 billion miles from Earth, it is heading at more
than 42,000 mph on a course to pass within 3,000 miles of Neptune
on Aug. 24.
   The number of discoveries at such a great distance from Neptune
suggests more finds are likely, according to Terrile, 38, a 10-year
Voyager project veteran who is among two dozen members of the
imaging team.
   ``At this time in the last encounter, Uranus, we had only found
one moon. I think the fact that we found four now bodes well for
finding more,'' he said.
   The moons may shed light on how Neptune formed. Neptune has a
large atmosphere and little is known about what its core is made of
and what is going on in there.
   Moons can provide a sample of material from a planet, or be
material captured by it, Terrile said.
   ``A planet just normally doesn't form by itself, it leaves
behind debris,'' he said, adding that the debris can be in the form
of moons or rings.
   Study of moons can also tell scientists about such events as
heating, collisions and geological activity in the solar system.
``The moons have on them, since they are surfaces, an imprinted
history of what's gone on,'' Terrile said.
   For the moment, the discoveries raise more questions than
answers. If there is a ring system, is it regular or irregular?
   ``We know very little about what's there, yet we're plunging a
spacecraft right through the system,'' Terrile said.
   Scientists believe Voyager 2 is in a fairly safe position, he
said, but if there is an irregular system ``we might find that it's
a rather hazardous place to fly the spacecraft through.''
   The newfound moons were only points of light on the images, but
the resolution will improve about 5 percent each of the next 10
days and then improve by 10 percent a day, Terrile said.
   Of the three, 1989 N3 is closest to Neptune, orbiting 17,000
miles above the planet's clouds and completing one orbit every 8
hours and 10 minutes.
   Orbiting 23,300 miles above the clouds, 1989 N4 circles Neptune
in 10 hours and 20 minutes; 1989 N2 is 30,000 miles above the
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes.
   Voyager 2 spotted the first new moon, 1989 N1, on June 21 and
tracked it until confirmation in July.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magellan, a robot spacecraft armed with a
sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with Venus and begin an
eight-month exploration and mapping of the Earth's nearest
neighbor, NASA officials said Thursday.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804-million-mile
voyage to Venus on Aug. 10 when it fires a rocket engine to settle
into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface.
   Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles
per hour and the rocket firing will slow Magellan to 18,400 miles
per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.
   After a checkout period lasting until about Sept. 1, Magellan
will use a powerful radar system to penetrate the dense clouds
above Venus and gather images for a detailed map of the baked
surface of the torrid planet.
   Tony Spear, the Magellan project manager, said at a news
conference that the only major problem experienced by the $413
million spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical
failure in one gyroscope.
   Spear said the spacecraft needs two gyros to control its
position and is equipped with four. Loss of the one gyro, he said,
still leaves a full set of two, plus one spare.
   Magellan was carried into space by the space shuttle Atlantis
and released into Earth orbit May 4, 1989. An upper stage rocket
engine fired to send Magellan streaking out of Earth orbit toward
Venus. During its 15-month voyage, the spacecraft looped the sun,
passed Earth's orbit once and then sped toward its August meeting
with Venus.
   Spear said the plans called for Magellan to spend 243 days, the
length of one Venus day, creating a radar map of 70 percent to 90
percent of the planet's surface. If the craft continues to perform,
Spear said the mission would be extended for additional mapping
cycles until 1995.
   Magellan will circle Venus once every three hours, spending 37
minutes of each orbit bouncing radar signals off the planet's
surface. Each pass will image a swath 10,000 miles long and about
16 miles wide. The data is stored in on-board recorders.
   When the spacecraft swings toward the high part of its orbit, it
will spin, aim its antennae toward Earth and spend 115 minutes
transmitting the radar data back to NASA's deep space network.
   Later, computers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory will process
the signals into images that resemble aerial photos. Scientists
expect Magellan to detect surface details as small as 260 yards
across, about 10 times more resolution than any of the 20 or so
spacecraft that have previously explored Venus.
   Venus holds fascination for scientists because it's nearly the
same size and mass as the Earth and the two planets are thought to
have shared a similar planetary formation history.
   But the two planets differ significantly in temperature and
pressure.
   Venus has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees _ about the
temperature of a self-cleaning oven _ and its atmosphere is almost
pure carbon dioxide. Venus has no liquid water and the atmospheric
pressure is more than 90 times that of Earth.
   Though Venus is 23 million miles closer to the sun than Earth,
it is covered by acid clouds so dense that its surface is in
perpetual twilight.
   Because of the clouds, only a radar such as that carried by
Magellan, can gather the images needed to map the Venusian surface.

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its 1995 encounter with Jupiter.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a NASA was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager Dick Spehalski said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
9:59 p.m. PST Friday. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager Bill O'Neil.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents Galileo from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of Venus, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, Johnson said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of Venus' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, Johnson said.
   The pictures and data were stored on Galileo's tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to Earth until October when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past Earth
on Dec. 8.
   The $1.35 billion mission also will let Galileo examine Earth,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995,
they arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above Venus' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on Earth.
   Ausman said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to Jupiter,''
Johnson said.
   Galileo will use the Earth as a gravity slingshot next December
and again Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward
Jupiter, Ausman said.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar map at
least 70 percent of Venus' surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result of
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo toward
Jupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block Galileo's mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate Florida
with plutonium in Galileo's nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
NASA said the risk was minimal.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on June 22 when it was
57.2 million miles from Neptune. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released Wednesday by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which called it ``the
best color photo of Neptune taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its Aug. 24 close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from Earth, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of Neptune. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot or Earth's
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on Jupiter, Saturn and apparently on Neptune are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe Earth's jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said Hansen and Caltech planetary
scientist Andrew Ingersoll.
   Jupiter's 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on Neptune,
Stone said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on Saturn, he added.
   Stone said that on Jupiter, and possibly Neptune, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. Jupiter's
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from Neptune to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
Neptune's atmosphere, said Rich Terrile, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying Neptune's atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' Terrile said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., in 1977.
   They explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in 1980
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and will fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's north pole cloudtops at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   Five hours later it will encounter Neptune's backward-orbiting
moon, Triton, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
Pluto's elongated orbit Neptune will be the ninth and outermost
until 2007.

   In 1990 and again in 1992, the most
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast
oceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by
earthquakes and active volcanoes.
   That planet is Earth.
   The Galileo spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the space
shuttle Atlantis on Thursday, is ultimately bound for Jupiter. But
its long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home
planet before dispatching it to Jupiter.
   That makes Galileo the first spacecraft to approach Earth from
interplanetary space.
   ``It's showing people what the Earth would look like to an
extraterrestrial,'' said Torrence Johnson, project scientist on the
Galileo mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earth
like this before. We're going to go in and see what this place
looks like.''
   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse
effect and the Antarctic ozone hole, Galileo will film what
scientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer and
writer Carl Sagan of Cornell University.
   In the movie, the Earth will appear as a thin, distant crescent,
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10
feet across are visible.
   As the spacecraft pulls away from Earth's sunlit side, it will
take a backward-looking shot showing five days of the Earth's
rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the Earth recedes.
   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tiny
planet that we're on,'' Sagan said.
   Galileo will also, at Sagan's suggestion, use its
state-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. And
on its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone hole
over Antarctica.
   ``Galileo has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed to
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the
global environment,'' Sagan said.
   Galileo is returning to Earth only to pick up a boost in speed
from Earth's gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After its
launch, Galileo will get a gravity kick by passing around Venus,
pick up more speed with the two passes by Earth and then begin its
primary mission to orbit Jupiter, explore its moons and dispatch a
probe into Jupiter's atmosphere.
   ``We wouldn't do anything on the Earth encounters if we thought
it would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said Fraser P. Fanale of
the University of Hawaii, who is in charge of Galileo's Earth
science objectives.
   Scientists say the $1.4 billion probe's investigation of Jupiter
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that
interplanetary exploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views of
Jupiter and its satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's images
will be 1,000 times clearer, they say.
   In 1995, a smaller probe is to be fired by Galileo into
Jupiter's cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the
Jovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushed
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.
   Galileo will orbit the planet gathering information on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces
such phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-old
storm larger than Earth.
   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in 1982 on a
direct course to Jupiter, but it has been delayed repeatedly as
Congress and the White House wrangled over NASA financing and as
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.
   On Sept. 28, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. They
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated
areas, but NASA said its evaluations indicated the risk of
contamination was very low.
   Galileo will do more than observe the Earth as it makes its way
to Jupiter. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments
to observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of things
we don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said Johnson.
``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a
picture of the whole moon from the data we have.''
   Galileo will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the
moon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of
the moon's crust and its interior.
   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by Venus, searching
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit at
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars
and Jupiter.
   Its observations of the Earth and moon may help resolve a debate
about the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of Louis A. Frank of the
University of Iowa.
   The theory holds that the Earth's lakes and oceans come from
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the
Earth's atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.
   If that's true, Galileo should be able to spot hydrogen clouds
around the Earth and the moon, the result of the comets' water
molecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor rising
from the moon as comets collide with its surface.
   Galileo will make the most accurate measurements yet of the
Earth's mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet
``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the
atmosphere.
   It may also show whether the Earth is shadowed by a ring of
interplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists have
proposed.
   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We may
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at
Jupiter,'' said Johnson.
   Finally, the Earth observations have what Johnson calls ``the
surprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planets
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even been
imagined. Could a fresh look at Earth do the same?
   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things people
hadn't thought about,'' Johnson said. ``Who knows?''

   NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to
launch ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle Oct.
12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes Earth, Galileo will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, study depletion
of Earth's protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early 1960s are available, said Torrence Johnson, the project
scientist.
   ``The Galileo spacecraft is a marvel,'' Neal Ausman Jr., the
mission director, said during a news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at JPL _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   Clayne Yeates, acting science and mission design manager, called
Galileo the ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on Jupiter and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said Yeates.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet Neptune this week, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
Jupiter in 1979.
   Galileo will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. Jupiter's atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on Earth. Galileo will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry Galileo into Earth
orbit Oct. 12, then launch the spacecraft. Galileo will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around Venus, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past Earth in December 1990, using
Earth's gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars,
where in October 1991 it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said Johnson.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past Earth again before being sent
on its way to Jupiter. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in August 1993.
   Galileo will make about 10 orbits around Jupiter, passing closest
to Io but also near Europa and Ganymede, two other Jovian moons.
   The Galileo mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in 1977, at which time launch was set for 1982. Budget cuts during
the Reagan administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said John
Casani, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at JPL.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Finds Giant `Dark Spot' On Neptune; May Be Huge Storm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a
6,200-mile-wide dark spot on Neptune, and scientists believe it's a
giant storm similar to Earth's hurricanes and Jupiter's Great Red
Spot.
   The width is about one-fifth of Neptune's 30,700-mile diameter,
just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the
size of Jupiter, said Andrew Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the
California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager 2 was launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977, visited
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its twin,
Voyager 1, explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and is now
heading toward interplanetary space.
   ``I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter
because Uranus was such a bland place,'' Ingersoll said Monday. ``So
I'm happy to see such action on Neptune.''
   The top Voyager scientist was similarly excited.
   ``It's huge!'' Caltech physicist and vice president Edward Stone
said of the dark spot.
   While the robot probe is too far from Neptune to detect winds
within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane-like storm system
similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said Stone,
chief scientist of the Voyager project for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   Hurricanes on Earth are much smaller, measuring several hundred
miles across. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week
or two, Jupiter's Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since
its discovery more than 350 years ago _ a mystery scientists have
yet to explain.
   Stone said Neptune's dark spot became apparent in photographs
taken by Voyager's television cameras in April, and faint hints of
it can be seen in pictures made as early as January.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as Jupiter
and Neptune may explain the persistence of the spots, Ingersoll
said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth.
   Voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to Neptune, the
solar system's fourth-largest planet, at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   It will swoop 3,000 miles from the planet's north pole, by far
the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecraft's
``grand tour'' of the giant, gaseous outer planets. Five hours
later, it will pass 25,000 miles from Triton, one of two known
Neptunian moons.
   Voyager 2 today was 2.66 billion miles from Earth and 58.98
million miles from Neptune, speeding toward that planet at 42,216
mph, said Mary Beth Murrill, spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Neptune's dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the
planet's southern hemisphere, Ingersoll said.
   Voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white
spot _ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees
south latitude, he said.
   The dark spot's color isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, Ingersoll said. But Stone said it is darker than Neptune's
surrounding skies, which are blue-green because of methane in its
mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
   Jupiter's Great Red Spot is believed to get its color from
organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within
it, said Ingersoll.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, Jupiter contains dozens of smaller
storm systems, which appear as white spots. Saturn has similar
storms, although they are less visible, Stone said.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and Neptune's dark spot, the scientists
said.
   The existence of Neptune's dark spot is mysterious because
scientists didn't think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce
winds, said Ingersoll. Unlike Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, Uranus
lacks enough internal heat to create big storms, Stone said.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, and is about
30 times farther from the sun than Earth. But because Pluto's
elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun,
Neptune will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until
the year 2007.

   An aging Pioneer spacecraft that
gave scientists their first close-up look at Venus continues to
yield secrets of the cloud-shrouded planet 10 years after its
launch, NASA says.
   The Pioneer orbiter has revealed many previously unknown
features of Venus, whose thick veil of sulfuric acid clouds has
kept Earth's telescopes from seeing its 800-degree surface.
   ``It challenges our thinking to try to understand why did Venus
evolve in such a different fashion than Earth,'' project scientist
Larry Colin said Friday. ``And are there any lessons to be learned
there in terms of the direction our own climate is evolving?''
   The probe, with some adjustments, should continue to send data
until it burns up in the Venusian atmosphere when its fuel runs out
in the summer of 1992, said Colin and project manager Richard
Fimmel.
   The two NASA officials quietly celebrated the 10th anniversary
of the probe's launch with a news briefing at NASA Ames Research
Center here, 35 miles south of San Francisco.
   The Pioneer orbiter, one of a series of space probes developed
at Ames, was launched at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 20,
1978. Pioneer originally carried five probes, which separated from
the orbiter and descended into Venus' atmosphere on Dec. 9, 1978,
studying the atmosphere before they burned up.
   Radar data from the $200 million probe provided scientists with
detailed maps of 90 percent of the planet's surface. The
information also helped them understand weather patterns in Venus'
dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and how the solar wind affects it.
   While Venus has been called Earth's twin because it is similar
in size and density, the planet is inhospitably hot because of what
scientists call a ``runaway greenhouse effect,'' or overheating
caused when the atmosphere trapped solar radiation.
   Pioneer revealed hints of old volcanoes on Venus, since
confirmed by radar studies from Earth and by the Soviet Union's
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft.
   But the orbiter is beginning to show its age.
   ``Like people, spacecraft get old, and Pioneer Venus has its
aches and pains,'' Fimmel said.
   The probe's solar cells, which power the craft and its
scientific instruments, are degrading, partly due to a natural
process, partly to bombardment by high-energy sun particles, Colin
said.
   When the orbiter had full power, scientists could run all the
instruments at once, but now they must operate them at different
times, he said.
   The probe, a cylinder 8 feet in diameter and 4 feet high and
topped with a yard-wide antenna dish, is now about 1,200 miles
above the planet's surface.
   Scientists are looking forward to the culmination of the mission
in 1992, when the probe's orbit will bring it within 93 miles of
Venus, into the upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere.
   Pioneer has been unable to take measurements in the planet's
atmosphere since its arrival because of a varying elliptical orbit.
During its fatal re-entry, the probe will be able to detect major
changes since then, Colin said.
   The orbiter also has studied several comets, including Halley's,
Encke, Giacobini-Zinner, Wilson, McNaught and
Nishikawa-Takimizawa-Tago.
   The Venus orbiter is one of six Pioneer probes still operating.
Sun orbiter Pioneer VI, launched in December 1965, is the oldest.
