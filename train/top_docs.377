On its convoluted journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft swung by Earth on 
Saturday, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:35 p.m., only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the $1.5-billion nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It was virtually perfect," said William J. O'Neil, Galileo's project manager 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design manager at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the Earth and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 
</P>
<P>
Two extremely sharp photographs taken Saturday by Galileo, one of the Earth and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes of these recorded images, Galileo will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the Earth after 
visiting another planet," O'Neil said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to Earth." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the Earth and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one JPL scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the Earth encounter went, 
scientists at JPL realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to Jupiter can be labeled a success. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step will take place Oct. 29, when Galileo passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on Dec. 8, 1992, it will have its second encounter with Earth, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Both swings around the Earth, as well as a rendezvous with Venus last February, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
As Galileo raced by Earth, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When Galileo scoots by Earth two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to Jupiter, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
When Galileo arrives at Jupiter late in 1995, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the summer of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into Jupiter's stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
Jupiter's four major moons with one of Earth's first telescopes.

   Seven months into its six-year, $1.35
billion journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft ignited its
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near Earth in December,
NASA said.
   The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two-day
maneuver that ends late today, said Jim Wilson, a spokesman at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth
flyby. It's a very gradual change,'' mission director Neal Ausman
said Friday.
   On Dec. 8, Galileo will swoop past Earth in a gravity slingshot
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the
sun and hurl it toward its 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the solar
system's largest planet.
   The spacecraft will study Earth during the flyby and again
during another slingshot maneuver in December 1992. Galileo used
Venus as a gravity slingshot Feb. 9.
   When the maneuver started at 11:10 a.m. PDT Friday, Galileo was
96 million miles from Earth, but had traveled a looping path of 365
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle Atlantis
last Oct. 18, Wilson said.
   Its trip to Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, will total
2.4 billion miles.
   The $1.35 billion mission will take Galileo past one asteroid in
1991 and perhaps another in 1993. In July 1995, the spacecraft
separates into a 4,890-pound orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They
are scheduled to reach Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense
atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two years
studying and taking snapshots of Jupiter and its major moons Io,
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
   One or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get Galileo
to swoop about 1,000 miles from Earth in December, Ausman said.
Without the maneuvers, the spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5
million miles.

   The spacecraft Galileo grabbed Earth's
gravity coattails Saturday and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to Jupiter.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, Galileo used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
Atlantic, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at 12:35 p.m. PST, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the Earth, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director Neal E. Ausman Jr. at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through Earth's shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the Jupiter encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager William J. O'Neil added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   Galileo's looping 2.4 billion-mile route to Jupiter made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered Galileo's instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from Earth, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from Earth's dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
Australia. Data and pictures will continue to come in as Galileo
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle Columbia.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to Galileo's $1.4 billion mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to Jupiter for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986
led to changes in Galileo's own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried Galileo into orbit Oct. 18, 1989, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from Venus and Earth.
   The spacecraft flew past Venus on Feb. 10. It will get another
boost from Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept Jupiter.
   Galileo will go into orbit around Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   A probe launched from Galileo five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore Jupiter and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   The Galileo spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with Earth next week so it can reach Jupiter in
1995, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said Thursday.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the Dec. 8 flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at Earth as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' Bill O'Neil, Galileo project
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989, starting its $1.4 billion, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in December 1995, the Galileo orbiter will spend two
years exploring Jupiter and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in Jupiter's atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   Galileo's route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and Earth as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach Jupiter. It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992. It used Venus as a
gravity slingshot last February.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and Earth. Data collected
at Venus was stored on Galileo's tape recorder and sent to Earth
last week.
   Galileo's optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of Venus' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But Galileo's infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in Venus' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, NASA scientist Robert Carlson
said.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.
   Galileo also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from Venus, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said University of Iowa physicist Louis
Frank.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around Venus. Scientists played the tape Thursday.
   Galileo will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest Atlantic
Ocean at 3:35 p.m. EST Dec. 8. Galileo was 4.46 million miles from
Earth on Thursday.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy Earth's protective ozone
layer, Johnson said.
   Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from Earth, he added.

   The Galileo spacecraft, looping through
the solar system on the way to its 1995 exploration of Jupiter,
fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it
near Earth late this year.
   ``We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move
closer and closer to our aim point near Earth on Dec. 8,'' said
Neal Ausman, mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit
in the palm of a hand, started firing at 11:10 a.m. PDT and will
fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends Saturday
afternoon, laboratory spokesman Jim Wilson said.
   The two-day maneuver will slow the spacecraft, which was
traveling about 66,000 mph earlier today, by about 25 mph. It also
will gradually alter its direction, Ausman said.
   It is the second of three or four maneuvers needed to bring
Galileo within 1,000 miles of Earth, which will act as a gravity
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun and
propel it toward Jupiter, he added. Without maneuvers, the
spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5 million miles.
   As of today, Galileo was 96 million miles from Earth, but has
traveled a looping path of 365 million miles since it was launched
from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18. Its trip to Jupiter will
total 2.4 billion miles.
   Galileo will make a second swing past Earth in December 1992. It
flew past Venus in another gravity slingshot maneuver on Feb. 9.
   In July 1995, the spacecraft separates into a 4,890-pound
orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They are scheduled to reach Jupiter,
the solar system's largest planet, on Dec. 7, 1995.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter before the probe is destroyed by
intense atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two
years studying and taking snapshots of Jupiter and its major moons
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

   NASA engineers were unwilling to wait
until October to see the Galileo spacecraft's photographs of Venus,
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures
sent to Earth early.
   One of the photos released Wednesday shows clouds as small as 25
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere.
It was taken Monday night when the Jupiter-bound Galileo was about
1 million miles past Venus, the second planet from the sun.
   ``You can see clouds, and you can see some very interesting
detail in the cloud patterns,'' said Neal Ausman, Galileo mission
director at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``The engineers and scientists are
exceptionally pleased.''
   Galileo is scheduled to go into orbit around Jupiter in December
1995 in a $1.35 billion mission to study the solar system's largest
planet. Just before 10 p.m. PST last Friday, the spacecraft swooped
about 10,025 miles over Venus so that planet could act as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to Jupiter.
   Most of the photographs and other data collected during and
after the flyby won't be sent back until October, when the
spacecraft is closer to Earth. Galileo's main antenna now is furled
to protect it from the heat of the sun. A smaller antenna, which
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate, is
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft.
   But NASA engineers were able to get Galileo to send the three
photos back to Earth on Monday and Tuesday by transferring separate
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio
transmission, Ausman said.
   NASA spokesman Jim Wilson called the technique ``experimental
and difficult.''
   Ausman said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study Venus'
lower atmosphere, as well as ultraviolet light measurements and
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in
space around Venus.
   By the time Galileo's fly-by of Venus formally ends Friday
night, the spacecraft's television camera will have taken about 80
pictures of cloud-shrouded Venus.
   Many other spacecraft have photographed Venus, some from much
closer than Galileo. But the new photos still should have
scientific value, Ausman said.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18 on a looping 2.4 billion, six-year route that requires Venus and
Earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to
Jupiter. It will fly past Earth on Dec. 8, then again on Dec. 8,
1992.
   Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, the Voyager
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the
solar system, according to JPL spokeswoman Mary Hardin.
   Voyager 1, which photographed Jupiter in 1980 and Saturn in
1981, was ordered to shoot the pictures Tuesday evening. But it
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs
to travel the 3.7 billion miles to Earth, Hardin said Wednesday.

   The Galileo spaceship swooped past Venus
early Saturday, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at 12:59 a.m. EST, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said Bill O'Neil, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting Galileo to Jupiter has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
Earth confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered Galileo's infrared
light sensor to start observing Venus. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, O'Neil said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier Friday, Galileo studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said Galileo project scientist Torrence Johnson. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
Jupiter.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director Neal Ausman.
   The $1.35 billion mission will let Galileo examine Earth, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995, they
arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mercury,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on Earth. Venus is about 95
percent as wide as Earth. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give Galileo a boost for
its trip to Jupiter by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the Earth as a slingshot next Dec. 8 and again
on Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward Jupiter,
Ausman said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having Galileo's camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting Thursday night and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
Galileo's four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to Earth
until October, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past Earth.
   Galileo was programmed to photograph Venus and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with Venus'
atmosphere. At the same time, NASA arranged for the Pioneer Venus
Orbiter, circling Venus since 1978, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, Johnson said.
   While nearly 20 other U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited
Venus, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have Galileo send back a small
amount of data, Johnson added.
   Studies from Earth and previous spacecraft indicate Venus has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing Mount Everest and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least 70 percent of Venus'
surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally
planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching
it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. NASA decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So Galileo was launched with a much weaker Inertial Upper Stage
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required NASA to redesign Galileo's route so the craft could
utilize gravity from Venus and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to Jupiter.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop NASA from having a
shuttle carry Galileo into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate Florida with plutonium in Galileo's
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. NASA said the
risk was minimal.
   Galileo is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered Jupiter's major moons.

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its 1995 encounter with Jupiter.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a NASA was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager Dick Spehalski said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
9:59 p.m. PST Friday. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager Bill O'Neil.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents Galileo from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of Venus, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, Johnson said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of Venus' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, Johnson said.
   The pictures and data were stored on Galileo's tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to Earth until October when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past Earth
on Dec. 8.
   The $1.35 billion mission also will let Galileo examine Earth,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995,
they arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above Venus' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on Earth.
   Ausman said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to Jupiter,''
Johnson said.
   Galileo will use the Earth as a gravity slingshot next December
and again Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward
Jupiter, Ausman said.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar map at
least 70 percent of Venus' surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result of
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo toward
Jupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block Galileo's mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate Florida
with plutonium in Galileo's nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
NASA said the risk was minimal.

<HEAD>Galileo Flyby Spurs NASA `Aliens' to Conclude There's Life on
Earth</HEAD>

   NASA scientists pretending to be
explorers from another world said Wednesday they had concluded life
exists on Earth, and it may be intelligent.
   The scientists based their conclusinon on data from the
Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft.
   ``The accumulated evidence we have ... would give your
hypothetical explorer a very strong indication you had biological
activity on Earth,'' said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief
scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's study of Earth illustrates how researchers use data
collected by spacecraft to reach conclusions about other planets.
   Galileo boomeranged past Earth and the moon Dec. 8, using the
planet's gravity as a slingshot to speed it up and expand its orbit
around the sun so it can reach Jupiter in 1995.
   Scientists used the opportunity to treat Earth as an alien
planet, ordering Galileo to snap a few thousand pictures and make
numerous measurements. They outlined their findings during a
Wednesday news conference.
   Measurements made by Galileo's infrared light-detecting
instrument showed Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrous oxide,
methane and oxygen, indicating ``there's a lot of life'' on the
planet, said laboratory scientist Robert W. Carlson.
   Another of Galileo's instruments picked up non-natural radio
signals that got stronger closer to the planet, which would make
alien scientists strongly suspect Earth has intelligent life that
makes radio broadcasts, Johnson said.
   The spaceship also detected lightning bolts, made measurements
to help explain creation of the Northern and Southern Lights,
determined the planet is warmed by a mild ``greenhouse effect'' and
detected a high-altitude ice cloud that helps cause the annual hole
in the protective ozone layer over Antarctica.
   On the moon, Galileo found evidence of a huge volcanic eruption
4 billion years ago. That shows such volcanic activity occurred
about 200 million years earlier than previously believed, said
Brown University geologist Jim Head.
   The spacecraft's pictures also confirmed the existence of a
1,200-mile-wide meteorite impact basin on the southern hemisphere
of the moon's far side, the largest such crater ever identified,
Head said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration released nine
more of Galileo's photos of the Earth and moon Wednesday.
   One was a mosaic, assembled from 11 separate pictures, showing
all of icy Antarctica. Others showed huge lunar craters, a color
map of minerals on the moon's surface, clouds swirling over South
America, and Australia's larger lakes and Great Barrier Reef.
   The pictures didn't display evidence of life on Earth because
Galileo's closest approach to the planet, at a distance of 597
miles, was over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. The detail in the
pictures was inadequate to reveal buildings, scientists said.
   NASA also displayed two short movies, made by assembling
hundreds of Galileo's still photos, showing the Earth and moon
spinning.
   ``Top that, Ted Turner!'' Head declared after the colorized
lunar movie was played. He was referring to media mogul Turner's
controversial practice of colorizing classic films.
   Also Wednesday, Galileo fired its thrusters repeatedly to aim
itself properly for its close encounter with the asteroid Gaspra
next Oct. 29, said project manager Bill O'Neil.
   Galileo will swing past Earth again Dec. 8, 1992, for a final
``gravity slingshot'' maneuver to help it reach Jupiter. In July
1995, Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe. Both will
reach Jupiter in December 1995.
   The probe will descend into Jupiter's atmosphere, returning data
to the orbiter until the probe is crushed by intense atmospheric
pressure. The orbiter will circle Jupiter for at least two years,
studying the planet and making closeup pictures of its 10 largest
moons.

<HEAD>Nationwide Survey Finds Americans Are ``Scientific Illiterates''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 500 years after Copernicus postulated that
Earth revolves around the sun, millions of Americans think
otherwise, suggests a poll that found vast numbers of the nation's
adults ``scientifically illiterate.''
   Many Americans also mistakenly believe that laser beams are
focused sound waves and that atoms are smaller than electrons, said
Jon Miller, director of the Public Opinion Laboratory at Northern
Illinois University, who conducted a nationwide survey for the
National Science Foundation.
   In a July telephone survey, 2,041 adults 18 or older were asked
about 75 questions on basic science, Miller said. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Asked whether the Earth goes around the sun or the sun around
the Earth, 21 percent replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they
didn't know.
   In the early 16th century, the Polish astronomer Nicholas
Copernicus laid the foundation for modern astronomy with his
heliocentric theory of planetary motion in which the planets
revolved around a motionless sun.
   Forty-five percent correctly said it takes a year for the Earth
to orbit the sun, but 17 percent said one day, 2 percent said one
month and 9 percent didn't know.
   ``The results show that on very basic ideas, vast numbers of
Americans are scientifically illiterate,'' Miller said Sunday.
``It's a fairly dire situation.''
   The results of the survey haven't been fully tabulated yet, but
it appears that 93 percent to 95 percent would have to be
considered scientifically illiterate, lacking fundamental knowledge
of scientific vocabulary, methodology and an understanding of
science's impact on the world, said Miller. The group's 1985 survey
found a 95 percent illiteracy rate.
   The results indicate many Americans have little idea of what
presidential candidates are talking about when they list key issues
such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, acid rain, the greenhouse
effect and the space race, he said.
   Leon Lederman, who last week was named co-winner of the 1988
Nobel Prize for physics and is director of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, called the latest findings
``pretty devastating.''
   ``How you can preserve democracy when the world is increasingly
more complex scientifically and technologically, and people are
increasingly more ignorant of the issues?'' he asked.
   On other questions, the survey found that 43 percent said
correctly that electrons, which are components of atoms, are
smaller than atoms; 20 percent thought they were larger and 37
percent had no idea.
   Asked if lasers _ an essential component of the proposed Star
Wars defense system _ work by focusing sound waves, 36 percent
correctly answered the statement was false. Twenty-nine percent
thought it was true and 35 percent didn't know. Lasers work by
focusing light waves. In fact, the name stands for Light
Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
   Most of those surveyed _ 76 percent _ answered correctly that
light travels faster than sound. Nineteen percent mistakenly
thought sound moves faster.
   Miller said some of the responses indicate the lack of
scientific knowledge could present some practical problems.
   For example, 63 percent said incorrectly that antibiotics kill
viruses as well as bacteria.
   So if a doctor tells a patient he has a virus and the patient
has an antibiotic around the house, he's liable to take it, said
Miller. Antibiotics don't kill viruses.
   Miller said the great majority of high school graduates have not
had a day's instruction in algebra, physics or chemistry.
   ``It's important to turn that around,'' he said.

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the Galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the Earth
on its long voyage to Jupiter.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but Johnson said Thursday the last good
pictures before Galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the 1960s.
   Galileo passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. It used Earth's gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach Jupiter in 1995. It used Venus for the same purpose
last February and will fly past Earth again in December 1992.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel Galileo
on its $1.4 billion mission to Jupiter. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study Venus and Earth in dress
rehearsals for exploring Jupiter.
   Three of Galileo's new photographs of the moon and Earth were
released Thursday by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as Galileo zoomed away from Earth, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows Mare
Orientale, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from Earth. Because of
the way the moon orbits Earth, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from Earth.
   Galileo's third picture shows half of Antarctica, including the
Ross Ice Shelf and mountains poking through ice near McMurdo Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
Earth and moon as if we were alien observers,'' Johnson said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   Galileo is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said Clark Chapman, a researcher from the Planetary
Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' Chapman said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   NASA plans to release more pictures Wednesday and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning Earth.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed Thursday during a NASA
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above Australia and more distant peeks at Asia,
India, Baja California and the Andes.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
Jupiter. But after the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, NASA decided it was too risky to launch Galileo from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring Galileo to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

GALILEO SPACECRAFT RIGHT ON TARGET FOR EARTH FLYBY DEC. 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After taking a brief look at Venus, the Galileo spacecraft is speeding toward a 
close encounter with Earth Dec. 8 on its long journey to Jupiter and it is 
expected to hit its desired course almost on the button, scientists reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had tried to block the launch of Galileo last year because 
its instruments draw their energy from nuclear power, and some feared that a 
launch failure or a subsequent collision with Earth could release deadly 
radioisotopes into the atmosphere. But there is no chance of that, scientists 
said, because Galileo will be within about 16 miles of its desired course, 
passing 590 miles over the surface of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo will make an even closer Earth flyby in two years, passing less than 
200 miles from the planet on its way to its ultimate destination, Jupiter. But 
nothing about the spacecraft has given officials with the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration anything to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"The spacecraft's health is excellent," said Galileo project manager William J. 
O'Neil of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo is functioning so well that "we don't have to do anything on the ground 
or anything on the spacecraft" to successfully zip by the Earth and use gravity 
to boost its speed by about 15,000 m.p.h. That is one of several maneuvers that 
Galileo will go through in order to reach Jupiter, where it will conduct a 
two-year study of the Jovian system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans did not call for Galileo to fly past either Venus or Earth, 
but a new course had to be developed after changes in the space program 
resulting from the Challenger disaster precluded the use of a rocket powerful 
enough to send it on a direct course to Jupiter. So both Venus and Earth are 
bonuses along the way, and scientists expect to make full use of both 
opportunities to study planets that are very similar in some ways, but quite 
different in others. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth flyby will be unique in that, for the first time, a spacecraft will 
reveal the Earth as it would appear to an alien spacecraft flying through the 
solar system. The flyby is expected to produce some first-ever pictures of the 
Earth and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see portions of the far side of the moon that have never been looked 
at with modern sensors," said Torrence V. Johnson of JPL, the project 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The images that Galileo will send back as it speeds toward Earth, as well as 
the thousands of photographs it will take of Jupiter and that planet's moons, 
could be exceptionally rewarding because the camera aboard Galileo is capable 
of creating extremely sharp images in very low light, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Belton, leader of the imaging team, Galileo's camera is 
about 100 times as sensitive to light as the cameras that sent back spectacular 
images from the two Voyagers as they explored the outer reaches of the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo's visit to Venus has been upstaged by JPL's Magellan spacecraft, which 
uses a radar camera to pierce through the sulfur dioxide clouds that hide the 
planet's surface, but at least it gave scientists a chance to check out their 
instruments and pick up a little precious data on the brilliant white planet. 
</P>
<P>
The data, collected in February, was stored aboard the spacecraft until last 
week, when Galileo was close enough to Earth to transmit it back. Scientists 
have spent the last few days devouring the information. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas came early this year," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
And there were a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Galileo's instruments detected a concentration of electrons 
traveling at far higher speeds than would have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
The electrons apparently were accelerated to the extraordinary speeds because 
of some "interaction" of Venus with the million-mile-an-hour wind blowing off 
the sun. Asked the significance of the discovery, Louis Frank of the University 
of Iowa, head of the plasma science team, said: 
</P>
<P>
"It shows our ignorance of how to push particles around the solar system." 
</P>
<P>
The photos of Venus taken by Galileo do not rival the sharp radar images that 
Magellan has been sending back for the last few weeks, but scientists embraced 
them anyway because they reveal additional details about the clouds that cover 
Venus. That, in turn, is important because it gives scientists a chance to 
study the atmosphere of a planet that evolved quite differently from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in an atmosphere that we are changing," Belton said, referring 
to the global warming effect that many scientists believe is taking place on 
Earth. "If you don't want the Earth to change into something like that (Venus), 
then you better learn about atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
Venus has an atmosphere that is rich in carbon dioxide, so it has already 
experienced the greenhouse effect. It is also devoid of life.

SHUTTLE ALOFT, SENDS GALILEO ON 6-YEAR VOYAGE TO JUPITER

<P>
The shuttle Atlantis roared into space Wednesday on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the 9:53 a.m. PDT launching and is 
finally on its way to Jupiter. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the Galileo and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director Robert Sieck said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth the wait," said Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center in 
Mountain View, Calif., one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for Galileo to reach Jupiter, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of Earth as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, NASA officials considered scrapping the $1.4-billion project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as NASA reevaluated the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to Jupiter. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, NASA decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving Galileo with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was saved when engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to Jupiter without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push Galileo 
beyond Earth's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give Galileo the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so Galileo will have to take the scenic back 
roads to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
After Galileo was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced speed left Galileo falling toward the sun. But, in February, 
Galileo will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing Galileo around and throw it back toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1990, Galileo will come within 600 miles of Earth, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using Earth's gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of Earth's orbit. Ten months later, 
Galileo is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1992, Galileo will make a daringly close approach to Earth, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, that should give Galileo the speed it will need to reach 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if Galileo accidentally plunges down 
into Earth's atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
That would require multiple failures, which NASA judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for NASA, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt Wednesday's launching.

Although Galileo will send data back to Earth during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters Jupiter. Galileo will loop 
around Jupiter and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots.

About 150 days before Galileo reaches Jupiter, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data

   NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to
launch ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle Oct.
12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes Earth, Galileo will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, study depletion
of Earth's protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early 1960s are available, said Torrence Johnson, the project
scientist.
   ``The Galileo spacecraft is a marvel,'' Neal Ausman Jr., the
mission director, said during a news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at JPL _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   Clayne Yeates, acting science and mission design manager, called
Galileo the ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on Jupiter and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said Yeates.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet Neptune this week, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
Jupiter in 1979.
   Galileo will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. Jupiter's atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on Earth. Galileo will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry Galileo into Earth
orbit Oct. 12, then launch the spacecraft. Galileo will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around Venus, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past Earth in December 1990, using
Earth's gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars,
where in October 1991 it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said Johnson.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past Earth again before being sent
on its way to Jupiter. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in August 1993.
   Galileo will make about 10 orbits around Jupiter, passing closest
to Io but also near Europa and Ganymede, two other Jovian moons.
   The Galileo mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in 1977, at which time launch was set for 1982. Budget cuts during
the Reagan administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said John
Casani, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at JPL.

   In 1990 and again in 1992, the most
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast
oceans, a churning, molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by
earthquakes and active volcanoes.
   That planet is Earth.
   The Galileo spacecraft, scheduled for launch aboard the space
shuttle Atlantis on Thursday, is ultimately bound for Jupiter. But
its long, looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home
planet before dispatching it to Jupiter.
   That makes Galileo the first spacecraft to approach Earth from
interplanetary space.
   ``It's showing people what the Earth would look like to an
extraterrestrial,'' said Torrence Johnson, project scientist on the
Galileo mission. ``We've never conducted a mission to planet Earth
like this before. We're going to go in and see what this place
looks like.''
   In addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse
effect and the Antarctic ozone hole, Galileo will film what
scientists are calling the Earth movie, proposed by astronomer and
writer Carl Sagan of Cornell University.
   In the movie, the Earth will appear as a thin, distant crescent,
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10
feet across are visible.
   As the spacecraft pulls away from Earth's sunlit side, it will
take a backward-looking shot showing five days of the Earth's
rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the Earth recedes.
   ``A continuous zoom movie like that would be, it seems to me,
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space, of the tiny
planet that we're on,'' Sagan said.
   Galileo will also, at Sagan's suggestion, use its
state-of-the-art instruments to map the atmosphere for methane,
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming. And
on its first pass, it will peer directly down into the ozone hole
over Antarctica.
   ``Galileo has such capable and novel instruments, it seemed to
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the
global environment,'' Sagan said.
   Galileo is returning to Earth only to pick up a boost in speed
from Earth's gravity as it begins its six-year journey. After its
launch, Galileo will get a gravity kick by passing around Venus,
pick up more speed with the two passes by Earth and then begin its
primary mission to orbit Jupiter, explore its moons and dispatch a
probe into Jupiter's atmosphere.
   ``We wouldn't do anything on the Earth encounters if we thought
it would jeopardize the primary mission,'' said Fraser P. Fanale of
the University of Hawaii, who is in charge of Galileo's Earth
science objectives.
   Scientists say the $1.4 billion probe's investigation of Jupiter
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that
interplanetary exploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views of
Jupiter and its satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's images
will be 1,000 times clearer, they say.
   In 1995, a smaller probe is to be fired by Galileo into
Jupiter's cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the
Jovian atmosphere. The probe will transmit data until it is crushed
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure.
   Galileo will orbit the planet gathering information on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics,
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces
such phenomena as the mysterious Great Red Spot, a centuries-old
storm larger than Earth.
   The spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in 1982 on a
direct course to Jupiter, but it has been delayed repeatedly as
Congress and the White House wrangled over NASA financing and as
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule.
   On Sept. 28, activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium. They
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated
areas, but NASA said its evaluations indicated the risk of
contamination was very low.
   Galileo will do more than observe the Earth as it makes its way
to Jupiter. It will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments
to observe the dark side of the moon. ``There are a lot of things
we don't know about the far side of the moon,'' said Johnson.
``It's been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a
picture of the whole moon from the data we have.''
   Galileo will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the
moon's north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of
the moon's crust and its interior.
   The spacecraft will be active as it passes by Venus, searching
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning. And it will visit at
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars
and Jupiter.
   Its observations of the Earth and moon may help resolve a debate
about the ``space snowballs'' hypothesis of Louis A. Frank of the
University of Iowa.
   The theory holds that the Earth's lakes and oceans come from
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the
Earth's atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year.
   If that's true, Galileo should be able to spot hydrogen clouds
around the Earth and the moon, the result of the comets' water
molecules disintegrating. It should also detect water vapor rising
from the moon as comets collide with its surface.
   Galileo will make the most accurate measurements yet of the
Earth's mass, and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet
``airglow'' caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the
atmosphere.
   It may also show whether the Earth is shadowed by a ring of
interplanetary dust around the sun, as some scientists have
proposed.
   All of these observations have another purpose, too. ``We may
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at
Jupiter,'' said Johnson.
   Finally, the Earth observations have what Johnson calls ``the
surprise component.'' The two Voyager flights to the outer planets
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadn't even been
imagined. Could a fresh look at Earth do the same?
   ``I would not want to bet against finding some things people
hadn't thought about,'' Johnson said. ``Who knows?''

   From 3.8 billion miles, the Earth is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said Wednesday as NASA released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in February and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded Feb. 13-14 but were not played back to Earth until
late March because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Earth and Venus.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, Mercury was too close to the sun
to be photographed and Pluto was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, Earth was within a band of sunlight but
Sagan said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
August and September 1977 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years 2000 and 2010. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in 1975.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
Jupiter, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in 1962.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except Pluto,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

   More than 450 years after Copernicus proved the
Earth revolves around the sun, millions of adult Americans seem to
think it's the other way around, a researcher said Sunday.
   ``It's a fairly dire situation,'' said Jon Miller, director of
the Public Opinion Laboratory at Northern Illinois University, who
conducted a nationwide survey for the National Science Foundation.
   ``The results show that on very basic ideas, vast numbers of
Americans are scientifically illiterate,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   In the telephone survey of 2,041 adults 18 or older, conducted
in July, people were asked about 75 questions testing their
knowledge of basic science, Miller said. The survey had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   Asked whether the Earth goes around the sun or the sun around
the Earth, 21 percent replied incorrectly. Seven percent said they
didn't know.
   Of the 72 percent who answered correctly, 45 percent said it
takes one year for the Earth to orbit the sun, 17 percent said one
day, 2 percent said one month and 9 percent didn't know.
   The responses indicate that about 55 percent of adult Americans,
or some 94 million people, don't know that the Earth revolves
around the sun once a year, Miller said.
   ``It shows that there are basic misunderstandings about some of
the things we would have presumed virtually everyone would have
known,'' said Miller, a political science professor at Northern
Illinois University in DeKalb, about 60 miles west of Chicago.
   A similar survey conducted by the polling group in 1985
indicated that only about 5 percent of adult Americans could be
considered ``scientifically literate,'' with basic knowledge of
scientific vocabulary, methodology and an understanding of the
impact of science on the world, Miller said.
   Miller said the latest results, which haven't been fully
tabulated yet, should put the literacy rate in the 5 to 7 percent
range. The survey results will be incorporated into an National
Science Foundation report to be issued next year on the state of
American science and technology.
   Leon Lederman, who was named co-winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize
for physics, called the latest findings ``pretty devastating.''
   ``I'm not surprised ... but it's much worse than anyone had
expected,'' he said Sunday in a telephone interview. ``How you can
preserve democracy when the world is increasingly more complex
scientifically and technologically, and people are increasingly
more ignorant of the issues.''
   Lederman said he plans to retire next year as director of the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., to teach
physics to freshmen at the University of Chicago.
   ``Get them while they're young ... if you get them as a senior
it's too late,'' he said. ``We have to roll up our sleeves and get
to work ... to improve and solve the scientific literacy question.''
   In an election year, in which candidates are talking about
issues like the Strategic Defense Initiative, acid rain, the
greenhouse effect and the space race, the survey results indicate
many Americans have little idea of what the candidates are talking
about, Miller said.
   Asked a true-false question on whether lasers _ an essential
component of the Star Wars defense system _ work by focusing sound
waves, only 36 percent of the respondents correctly answered the
statement was false. Twenty-nine percent thought it was true and 35
percent said they didn't know.
   Lasers work by focusing light waves.
   ``I think the next president and Congress have to face this
issue (of scientific illiteracy) in some fashion or the other,'' he
said.
   Miller says schools deserve a lot of blame for doing a poor job
in teaching math and science.

   The Galileo space ship cruised on the
next leg of its 2.4-billion mile, six-year trip to Jupiter after
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act
like a mad shutterbug.
   Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on Saturday, but for
about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera
opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None
of those unintended exposures were recorded.
   NASA engineers sent the 2.8-ton Galileo new computer commands
late Saturday, and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures, right
on schedule, of cloud-shrouded Venus in a series that ended Sunday
morning.
   ``They seem to understand what happened, and they're not
concerned about any repeats,'' said Bob MacMillin, spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Galileo is now flying back toward Earth so the planet can act as
a gravity slingshot on Dec. 8 to help the spacecraft reach Jupiter
in 1995 in a $1.35 billion mission to explore the solar system's
largest planet.
   Galileo swooped about 10,000 miles above the 900-degree
Fahrenheit surface of Venus at 9:59 p.m. PST Friday in the
mission's first ``gravity assist maneuver.'' Venus helped increase
Galileo's speed by almost 5,000 mph, giving it enough energy to get
to Jupiter.
   After the flyby, the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study
Venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning. The camera
bugs then developed.
   MacMillin said engineers determined Galileo's camera and
computer were fine, and that the problem was in a computer program
sent from Earth to tell Galileo what to do and when to do it.
   The problem was caused by improper timing between various
commands within the computer program, MacMillin said.
   He said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as
Galileo. The craft was deployed Oct. 18 from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then launched by a solid-fueled booster to start
its looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to Jupiter.
   The spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at Venus
until late this Friday, taking 27 more photos and using other
sensors to detect dust, infrared and visible light, and
electrically charged particles.
   The pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecraft's
tape recorder. Almost all of them will be sent back to Earth in
October when Galileo is close enough to send scientific information
using its small antenna.
   That antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft. A
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the sun's heat.
   After swinging past Earth in December, Galileo will explore
asteroid Gaspra in October 1991, then make another flight past
Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. The spacecraft may study asteroid Ida in
August 1993 before Galileo deploys a 760-pound probe in July 1995.
Galileo and the probe will reach Jupiter in December 1995.
   The probe will parachute into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to Galileo until it is vaporized by intense heat and
pressure. Galileo will swoop past the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes, then go into orbit around Jupiter to
study the planet and moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede at least
until late 1997.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Galileo spacecraft, speeding toward
a 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, successfully completed its first
course correction by firing its small thrusters more than 2,000
times, NASA said.
   The three-day maneuver, which ended Saturday night, accelerated
the spacecraft by about 38 mph, bringing its speed to more than
60,000 mph relative to the sun, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The trajectory change is meant to put Galileo in proper position
for its flight past Venus on Feb. 9, 1990. The spacecraft will
swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so the planets can act as
``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo toward Jupiter during the
$1.9 billion mission.
   In July 1995, Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe.
The orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months starting Dec. 7,
1995, and the probe will parachute into the Jovian atmosphere,
making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18. On
Monday, Galileo was 5.3 million miles from Earth and 36.9 million
miles along its looping 2.4-billion-mile path to Jupiter.
   Wilson said several of Galileo's 12 thrusters fired a total of
2,000 brief pulses during the trajectory maneuver, the first of
about 30 course corrections needed to get the spacecraft to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   A temperature sensor on one thruster malfunctioned Friday, so
another thruster was used Saturday, mission director Neal Ausman
said.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to Earth's hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like Earth's northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by Saturn, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form Titan's surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval Earth between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found Saturn's atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, Mariner and Pioneer probes found
that Venus is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through Venus' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on Earth.
   Photographs taken of Mercury by Mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard Mariner 10 found that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the Earth's and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976 and 1977
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier Mariners found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce summer storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

   Here are key events for the Galileo
spacecraft's looping, six-year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's
largest planet:
   Oct. 18, 1989 _ Galileo is released from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then an Inertial Upper Stage booster launches the
spacecraft on its long voyage.
   Nov. 9-11, 1989 _ Controllers order multiple firings of
Galileo's thrusters for the first of about 30 course correction
maneuvers.
   Dec. 22, 1989 _ Thrusters fire again for second course
correction.
   Feb. 9, 1990 _ Galileo swoops near Venus for its first ``gravity
assist'' maneuver, using the planet's gravity to increase the
spacecraft's speed to help it reach Jupiter. Galileo makes photos
and measurements of Venus, storing them on an onboard recorder.
   Late October 1990 _ Galileo plays back to Earth the photos and
measurements it made near Venus.
   Dec. 8, 1990 _ Galileo passes within 600 miles of Earth, making
photos and measurements during its second ``gravity assist''
maneuver, which will help aim it toward Jupiter.
   Oct. 29, 1991 _ The spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of
asteroid Gaspra, taking pictures and measurements.
   Dec. 8, 1992 _ Galileo zooms about 185 miles above Earth's
surface in the third and final ``gravity assist'' maneuver needed
to hurl it toward Jupiter.
   Aug. 28, 1993 _ If Galileo has adequate propellant supplies, it
passes 600 miles from asteroid Ida for photos and measurements.
   July 1995 _ The spacecraft separates into a 760-pound Galileo
probe and a 4,890-pound Galileo orbiter. Both continue toward
Jupiter.
   Dec. 7, 1995 _ The probe and orbiter arrive at Jupiter. The
probe plunges into the planet's atmosphere, relaying measurements
to the orbiter, then is destroyed by intense atmospheric pressure.
The orbiter speeds about 600 miles from the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers, then goes into orbit around
Jupiter.
   December 1995-October 1997 _ The orbiter circles Jupiter, making
photos and measurements of the giant planet and the moons Europa,
Ganymede and Callisto.

<TEXT>
   Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft
that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years
after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the
launch pad, NASA scientists said Monday.
   Disturbances in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus suggest that a
mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond Pluto, John D. Anderson
of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said as NASA observed the fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past Pluto's orbit.
   Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is
searching for long gravity waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and
the boundary of the sun's influence.
   The radio signals the 570-pound space probe is sending back _
from 45 times the distance between the Earth and the sun _ aren't
very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light.
But they are important to researchers trying to solve some
classical puzzles about the universe.
   The energy of the craft's signals picked up by a 70-meter deep
space antenna would have to be accumulated for over 11 billion
years to build up enough energy to light a 7{-watt nightlight for
one millisecond, said Richard O. Fimmel, project manager at the
NASA Ames Research Center.
   But the signals from Pioneer 10 and its twin, Pioneer 11,
launched in 1973, are strong enough to send ``high quality data on
a daily basis,'' said physicist James Van Allen of the University
of Iowa, a principal investigator on the Pioneer project.
   Van Allen, who discovered the radiation belts surrounding Earth,
said Pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its
original missions to study Jupiter and the asteroid belt between
Mars and Jupiter.
   ``One of the principal current objectives is the observation of
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored
distances from the sun,'' Van Allen said.
   ``We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer
boundary of the heliosphere, which is the sphere of influence of
the sun, and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,''
he said.
   But sadly, he said, Pioneer 10 may stop working before it
reaches the edge of the heliosphere.
   The tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10
years, Fimmel said, and may run out of energy before it reaches
interstellar space.
   Before that, however, Pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to
the shape of the heliosphere.
   And it is relaying strong evidence suggesting Planet X or
possibly two smaller unknown planets exist.
   ``We have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that Uranus and Neptune
are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet
X,'' said Anderson. ``It's conceivable there could be other
gravitational effects on the two orbits.
   ``We haven't ruled out other matter which could be in orbit
around the sun,'' he said. ``It could be small particulate matter.
It could be more than one planet that are very small. The best
hypothesis is a single planet X at one to four Earth masses.''
   Such a planet, he said, would likely be a mixture of ice and
rock.
   Pioneer 10 made its closest approach to Jupiter _ 82,000 miles _
on Dec. 3, 1973, 21 months after it was launched, after traveling
an arc-shaped 620 million-mile path from Earth.
   It was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, fly past
Jupiter and return pictures, chart Jupiter's intense radiation
belts, measure the mass of its four planet-sized moons, and
discover that Jupiter is predominantly a liquid planet.
   Pioneer 11 encountered Jupiter a year later, then reached Saturn
on Sept. 1, 1979.
   Both craft, though partly damaged along the way, far exceeded
their operations guarantee of at least 21 months. A spokesman for
TRW Inc. of Redondo Beach joked Monday that the company would fix
anything wrong with the two Pioneers if NASA could bring them back.

   Here are some facts, figures and
theories about Venus, the planet visited early today by the
Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth, and
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 96 percent carbon dioxide and most of the rest
nitrogen, but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor.
The atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on Earth.
   DAY LENGTH: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, so one day on
Venus equals 243 Earth days. Its rotation is retrograde, so the sun
rises in the west and sets in the east.
   YEAR LENGTH: Venus orbits the sun once every 225 Earth days.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.

   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched since 1978, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around Venus today on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said George Alexander, chief spokesman for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
NASA and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the Hubble Space Telescope, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   Magellan dived over Venus' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at 9:32 a.m., slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed Magellan to be captured by Venus' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
Steve Wall.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
Venus, out of radio contact with engineers on Earth. Magellan
emerged at 9:53 a.m., but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time Magellan's radio
signal takes to reach Earth.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said David Okerson, a Magellan project
engineer.
   In the Magellan project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary Sharon Kyle.
   Magellan encountered Venus 144 million miles from Earth after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The $413 million Magellan, the heart of a $744 million mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by Sept. 1.
   NASA plans to release the first pictures in September, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   Magellan has raised NASA's hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Wesley T. Huntress Jr., NASA director of solar system exploration,
said Thursday. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot Magellan, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since 1978,
when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
Venus.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' Huntress said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
between 1979 and last year, but they were launched in 1977.
Galileo, launched in October, is headed toward a 1995 rendezvous
with Jupiter.
   During the coming decade or so, NASA also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, Saturn, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   NASA has said Magellan would return more data than all previous
NASA missions combined.
   Venus is similar to Earth in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   NASA wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to Earth's. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   Magellan was named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by Martin Marietta Corp. and its radar
was built by Hughes Aircraft Co.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward Neptune, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from Earth.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone, referring to
Voyager's previous exploration of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the next week,'' Stone
said during a late morning news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for Thursday's close encounter with Neptune and
Friday's flight past its largest moon, Triton. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means Voyager will fly closest to Neptune about 8:55 p.m. PDT
Thursday.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at 8:15 a.m. PDT today indicating the thrusters
started firing at 4:09 a.m. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with Neptune has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' says Jurrie van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around Neptune's north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of Triton and another moon,
Nereid. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to Neptune, cable television stations will
carry live NASA broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which had been discovered from Earth,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting Neptune.
   Voyager also discovered Neptune has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like Earth's jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   NASA listed Voyager's position as of 9 a.m. today as 2.743
billion miles from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   Neptune, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   Thursday night, Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus
in 1986.
   Sunday was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
Florida on Aug. 20, 1977. The Neptune encounter is the climax of the
$865 million, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the Neptune encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will conduct daily news conferences through Aug. 29.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling Saturn and Uranus.
   They also say Neptune's magnetic field may create auroras like
Earth's northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind Neptune.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
Neptune's atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside Neptune.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   The Galileo spacecraft makes a
rendezvous with Earth on Saturday, using the planet's gravity like
a slingshot to hurl it along on its six-year journey to the solar
system's largest planet, Jupiter.
   Launched in October 1989, Galileo will swoop about 593 miles
above the southwest Atlantic Ocean at 12:35 p.m. PST.
   The pass will be monitored by mission controllers at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   During the flyby, the spacecraft will measure gases that cause
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere and will
study high-altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy
Earth's ozone layer, scientists said.
   Galileo will also be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which always faces
away from Earth.
   On Oct. 18, 1989, Galileo was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis. Then its own rocket booster launched the
spacecraft on its long voyage, with arrival at Jupiter scheduled in
1995.
   In February, Galileo neared Venus for its first ``gravity
assist'' maneuver, using the planet's gravity as a slingshot to
help it reach Jupiter.
   Next Oct. 29, the spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of asteroid
Gaspra, taking pictures and measurements. Then, on Dec. 8, 1992,
Galileo zooms about 185 miles above Earth's surface in the third
and final ``gravity assist'' maneuver needed to hurl it toward
Jupiter.
   Galileo will arrive at Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995. The spacecraft
will orbit the planet and launch a probe to plung into its
atmosphere.

   Here are key facts about the Magellan
spacecraft, which is scheduled to go into orbit around Venus in
August:
   PRIMARY MISSION: To use radar to penetrate the clouds of Venus
and make pictures and maps of 70 percent to 90 percent of the
planet's surface with 10 times better detail than any previous
images. Magellan will reveal signs of forces that shaped the
planet, including volcanism, meteorite impacts and possibly wind,
water and large-scale movements of the planet's crust.
   EXTENDED MISSION: A single Venusian day _ the time it takes the
planet to rotate once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days.
Magellan's primary mission is to map the planet as it rotates once
below the polar-orbiting spacecraft. But NASA scientists expect to
obtain approval for additional 243-day mapping cycles so they can
make pictures and maps of most of the surface. The primary mission
will miss the planet's southernmost latitudes.
   COST: $744 million through the end of Magellan's primary 243-day
mapping effort, including $413 million for the spacecraft and its
instruments. NASA cut costs by building Magellan using some spare
parts from Voyager and Galileo spacecraft.
   LAUNCH: Deployed from cargo bay of space shuttle Atlantis on May
4, 1989, then launched by an inertial upper stage booster.
   THE VOYAGE: A 806 million-mile trip to Venus in 15 months,
requiring 1{ loops around the sun.
   PROPULSION: A solid-fueled Star 48B rocket is to put Magellan
into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. Twenty-four liquid-fueled
thrusters help point the spacecraft and adjust its trajectory.
   ORBIT: Magellan will orbit near Venus' poles once every 3 hours
and 11 minutes, at an altitude ranging from 171 miles to almost
5,000 miles.
   VITAL STATISTICS: Magellan is 21 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and weighs 7,410 pounds.
   INSTRUMENTS: Synthetic aperture radar is to send radar waves and
catch the reflected waves to make two-dimensional pictures of
Venus, measure elevations for topographic maps, and determine heat
emissions from Venus' surface to provide clues about surface
roughness and rock composition. Engineers on Earth will precisely
track Magellan's speed to measure changes in the strength of the
gravity field on various parts of Venus. That will yield clues
about the planet's interior.
   POWER SUPPLY: A pair of solar panels charge the spacecraft's two
nickel-cadmium batteries.
   COMMUNICATIONS: Magellan's 12-foot antenna dish radios
information back to 230-foot, dish-shaped antennas in Spain,
Australia and Goldstone, Calif. The radar information will be
relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
where it will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   CONSTRUCTION: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the
project. Martin Marietta Corp. built the spacecraft in Denver.
Hughes Aircraft Co. built the radar in El Segundo, Calif.

   Hughes Aircraft Co. will ship its
rebuilt $157 million Galileo space probe to NASA on Wednesday so a
space shuttle can launch the probe and a mother ship toward Jupiter
in October.
   The $1.36 billion, six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage was delayed
3{ years by the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL (NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) on its way to Jupiter,''
Hughes vice president Steven Dorfman said at a news conference
Tuesday.
   Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said the 4-foot-diameter,
teardrop-shaped probe would be trucked Wednesday across the Los
Angeles area to Pasadena, where JPL runs America's unmanned space
exploration program for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the Kennedy
Space Center in April, followed the next month by the mother ship,
or Galileo orbiter. After the two are attached, the combined
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed
aboard the shuttle Atlantis.
   The launch is expected to take place between Oct. 12 and about
Nov. 21.
   After exploring two asteroids, the orbiter and probe will reach
Jupiter in December 1995, after separating 150 days earlier. The
probe will enter Jupiter's atmosphere at 115,000 mph, then deploy a
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planet's
atmosphere.
   The probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes
before it is crushed by Jupiter's tremendous atmospheric pressure.
   The orbiter will circle Jupiter for at least 20 months, studying
the planet and its surrounding moons, magnetic field and
electrically charged particles.
   The data will help scientists better understand the origin of
Jupiter, the solar system and the universe, said Richard Young,
Galileo probe project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View.
   Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in
May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet and
the fifth from the sun.
   Then Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986, killing seven crew
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last fall. After the
tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid-fueled
Centaurs aboard the shuttle.
   Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and
lengthened because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as
ideally as they were in 1986 and because the new booster is less
powerful.
   Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were
retested.
   On the new flight plan, Galileo will take six years instead of
three years to get to the gaseous, giant planet, traveling 2.4
billion miles although Jupiter is about 400 million miles from
Earth, Dore said. To gain energy for the trip, Galileo will use the
gravity of Venus and Earth in a slingshot effect.
   Galileo will swing toward Venus in February 1990, swing back
toward Earth that December, circle the sun, and swing around Earth
again in December 1992 before finally heading for Jupiter.
   The delay increased the probe's cost to $157 million from $133
million, said Benny Chin, Galileo probe project manager at
NASA-Ames. Total cost of the mission, from its official start in
1977 through completion in late 1997 is about $1.36 billion, said
Richard Spehalski, Galileo project manager at JPL.
   Spehalski said White House approval for the launch is expected in
September. Such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive
plutonium. A NASA environmental impact statement concluded last
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off
with Galileo is very small.

   Space shuttle Atlantis soared into
orbit Wednesday and its astronauts started the Galileo probe on a
six-year, roundabout journey to Jupiter for the closest look yet at
the colossus of the solar system.
   ``Galileo is on its way to another world; it's in the hands of
the best flight controllers in this world,'' said Atlantis
commander Don Williams.
   Earlier, concerns about Galileo's nuclear power supply were left
behind as Atlantis lifted off flawlessly on its mission to carry
the $1.5 billion space probe into orbit on the first leg of its
trip.
   After Atlantis had made five trips around the world, Galileo was
ejected from the cargo bay by springs at 7:15 p.m. EDT, precisely
on schedule, over the Gulf of Mexico east of Brownsville, Tex. The
shuttle quickly moved away to put distance between itself and the
space probe's rocket.
   The ``burn'' was an hour later over Borneo _ first for 2{
minutes, then for a minute, 45 seconds _ giving the 6,700-pound
Galileo the initial push toward Venus, its first planetary
port-of-call.
   ``On time and on schedule,'' said Mission Control.
   ``It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outbound
toward the sun,'' said Brian Welch, spokesman for Johnson Space
Center in Houston. A spacecraft can escape the Earth's gravity when
traveling faster than 25,000 mph.
   The five astronauts spent their first hours in space giving a
final electronic checkout to Galileo, a probe so sophisticated that
one NASA official dubbed it ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft.''
   ``Everything looks real good,'' said astronaut Shannon Lucid, a
one-flight veteran from Bethany, Okla., who had charge of the probe
deployment.
   The crew members reported a few problems with their own ship as
it orbited 184 miles above the Earth. One was with a cooling system
that might cause them to have to return slightly earlier than
planned in what a flight director called ``a worst-case scenario.''
   ``You looked marvelous going up,'' Mission Control told Williams
as the winged spacecraft reached orbit after two launch
postponements.
   ``I feel a lot better,'' said Williams.
   Galileo, named after the 17th century discoverer of Jupiter's
moons, will use the laws of physics to get to Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system, in 1995. Flying by Venus will cause it
to gain momentum and so will two subsequent close encounters with
Earth.
   Although concern over the Galileo's 49.4-pound plutonium power
supply was argued in court, it drew no protesters to the Kennedy
Space Center on launch day. Environmentalists had argued that a
Challenger-like accident could scatter deadly plutonium-238 over
Florida.
   Nothing like that happened Wednesday, and even the weather
cooperated. Clouds and rain threatened to halt the launch until the
last minutes of the countdown, but the clouds suddenly dissipated
and the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky, trailing a 700-foot
geyser of fire.
   The 132-ton Atlantis has a crew of five for the mission that
ends Monday with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California
at 2:38 p.m. EDT.
   The $1.5 billion mission already was seven years behind schedule
when Atlantis was grounded by rain at the last minute Tuesday and
by a faulty engine computer last week.
   ``It feels great,'' said NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk after
liftoff. ``It's been a long time.''
   Apart from Lucid, Williams' crew consists of pilot Mike McCulley
and mission specialists Ellen Baker and Franklin Chang-Diaz.
   The liftoff was the start of a voyage that will take the probe
on a looping path past Venus in February, back to within 620 miles
of Earth in December 1990 and past Earth again at a 200-mile
altitude two years later. The craft will arrive at Jupiter in
Deceber 1995 for a two-year orbit.
   As part of the mission, a robot will separate from the Galileo
spacecraft and plunge through Jupiter's gaseous atmosphere.
   Scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of the solar
system by studying Jupiter, which holds original material from that
event 14 billion years ago. The planet's diameter is about 11 times
that of Earth and its mass 318 times greater.
   The mission originally was to have started in 1982, but money
ran out. Then came the Challenger explosion in January 1986,
delaying all shuttle flights for three years and prompting a change
in the rocket to propel the Galileo.
   The mission originally was budgeted at $425 million. It will
climb to $1.9 billion by the time Galileo finishes a 10-orbit trip
around Jupiter in 1997.
   The sweeps past Earth and Venus will take advantage of the
planets' gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed
to reach its distant target. Small onboard motors will fine-tune
the flight path.
   The Galileo's electricity will be generated by decaying
radioactive pellets of plutonium-238, which causes cancer and death
in humans if inhaled in minuscule amounts.
   Environmental activists feared not only a launch accident but
also mishaps during the two flybys. NASA convinced a federal judge
that the plutonium containers could withstand such pressures and
that even if there were a release of radioactivity there would be
no appreciable health effects.
   The government had hundreds of experts in the launch area _ just
in case _ to monitor any radioactive release.
   More than 200 guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolled
the launch center for protesters who said they might try to stop
the launch by infiltrating the launch zone and sitting on the
launch pad.
   ``We've succeeded in a small way calling attention to the
escalating plan to put nuclear energy into space, including in Star
Wars,'' said Bruce Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice.
   ``The real fundamental point is that people haven't been doing
much more than ooo-ing and ahhh-ing at the launches. They haven't
been considering the moral and ethical issues of what is in these
things, where they are going and what they are doing.''

   Galileo's camera shutter snapped
uncontrollably for five hours Saturday after the spacecraft zipped
around Venus, but officials said it shouldn't endanger the $1.35
billion, eight-year mission to Jupiter.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory shut off the
television camera while diagnosing the problem, which apparently
involved faulty software that made Galileo's computer send
incorrect commands to the camera, mission director Neal Ausman said.
   They decided Saturday night to send new computer commands to
Galileo to restart the camera so it could take a series of
photographs of Venus late Saturday and early Sunday, said NASA
spokesman Bob MacMillin.
   The engineers believed an error in computer commands they sent
to Galileo made the shutter snap when it wasn't supposed to, and
they were ``pretty certain there's nothing wrong with the computer
or camera,'' he said.
   Galileo cruised around Venus at 9:59 p.m. PST Friday, coming
three to four miles closer to the planet than the planned point of
closest approach 10,028 miles above the Venusian surface, said
mission science and design manager Bill O'Neil.
   The camera appeared undamaged, but its shutter opened and closed
twice per minute 468 times over five hours, Ausman said. As
planned, only 16 pictures taken late Friday and early Saturday were
stored on Galileo's tape recorder, Ausman said.
   The malfunction didn't harm those pictures, and the 452 unwanted
shutter snappings were ``just like taking pictures with no film in
the camera,'' project manager Dick Spehalski said during a Saturday
news conference.
   However, the problem threatened five dozen other photos the
spacecraft was supposed to take in the coming week to make a
time-lapse movie of Venus' clouds and winds, said project scientist
Torrence Johnson.
   He said scientists weren't too upset because about 20 U.S. and
Soviet spacecraft have visited Venus previously, and the main
purpose of Galileo's flyby was to use Venus' gravity to speed the
spacecraft for its long trip to Jupiter.
   Galileo's other sensors will continue observing Venus as the
spacecraft speeds away from the planet, Spehalski said.
   Galileo was deployed Oct. 18 from space shuttle Atlantis on a
looping 2.4-billion, six-year route that requires Venus and Earth
to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to Jupiter.
   Once there, the spacecraft will deploy a probe to study
Jupiter's atmosphere, then orbit the giant gas planet for at least
two years in a mission that costs $1.35 billion.
   When the glitch developed at 1:41 a.m. PST Saturday, Galileo
already had snapped the 16 pictures to study Venusian wind and
cloud patterns and search for lightning that might indicate
erupting volcanoes beneath the clouds.
   The camera was shut off at 6:30 a.m. after engineers determined
it was following incorrect computer commands, Ausman said. Eight
minutes later the erroneous commands stopped without explanation.
   Despite the trouble, ``there was no point when the spacecraft
was in jeopardy,'' he said.
   Galileo's TV camera is perhaps the most critical instrument on
the spacecraft. It is expected to take pictures of Jupiter 20 to
1,000 times more detailed than those returned by the Voyager 1 and
2 spacecraft in 1979.
   The TV camera has a shutter, which opens to throw light on an
electronic sensor. Data from that sensor can be sent to Earth,
where it is assembled into a photograph.
   ``We're dealing with a fresh spacecraft and prototype
software,'' so NASA knowingly risked a glitch in exchange for
trying to photograph Venus even though the spacecraft is still in
the shakedown part of its trip to Jupiter, Johnson said.
   For now, the pictures and data gathered in the flyby are being
stored on Galileo's tape recorder, and won't be sent back to Earth
until October when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material. That antenna now can be used only for communications to
keep Galileo operating.
   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result of
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members.
   After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo toward
Jupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in only
two years.

   NASA has started testing sensors aboard
Galileo, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its
thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to Venus
and Jupiter.
   ``We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they
are ready to observe Venus'' when Galileo whizzes past the
cloud-shrouded planet Feb. 9, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   On Friday, Galileo fired its thrusters during a 2{-hour period
so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops,
Wilson said.
   ``The maneuver went off exactly as planned,'' Galileo mission
director Neal Ausman said.
   Wilson said another maneuver may be needed in late January to
fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory. The first trajectory
maneuver was performed in November.
   Galileo was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18.
It will swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so those planets can
act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo toward its 1995
encounter with Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   On Wednesday, the spacecraft was 12{ million miles from Earth,
but had traveled almost 105 million miles along its looping
185-million-mile path to Venus, Wilson said.
   The spacecraft still has 2.3 billion miles left out of its
2.4-billion-mile trip to Jupiter.
   After flying past Earth in December 1990 and December 1992,
Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe in July 1995.
   The orbiter will circle the giant gas planet for 22 months
starting in December 1995, the same month the probe will parachute
into the Jovian atmosphere, collecting information for 75 minutes
until it is crushed by overwhelming atmospheric pressure.
   Scientific information that Galileo collects during February's
Venus flyby won't be transmitted back to Earth until late October,
after the spacecraft unfurls its umbrella-shaped, high-gain
antenna, Wilson said.
   The antenna would be damaged by heat if it were as deployed near
Venus, the second planet from the sun, he added.

A federal judge Friday cleared the way for the launching of the space shuttle 
Discovery early today after ruling that three environmental groups had failed 
to demonstrate that the launching could result in radioactive contamination 
over much of the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery, scheduled for liftoff at 4:35 a.m. PDT, will carry the 
nuclear-powered Ulysses into orbit and then send the robotic spacecraft on a 
2-billion-mile journey to the sun by way of Jupiter. During its five-year 
mission, the craft will generate electricity for its instruments by tapping 
into the energy released by the radioactive decay of 24 pounds of plutonium 
238. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters had argued that a cataclysmic accident could release the plutonium 
into the atmosphere, and they asked U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in 
Washington to delay the launching for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Justice 
Department attorney Rebecca Donnellan said that such a postponement would cost 
$350 million. NASA has insisted that only nuclear power can supply the 
electricity the Ulysses probe will need when it travels through the dim light 
of the outer solar system, but critics insist that even NASA's own documents 
show that a solar-powered craft, launched atop a Titan-Centaur unmanned rocket, 
could have done the job without the radioactive power supply. 
</P>
<P>
With the court victory behind them, NASA officials looked forward to today's 
launching and hoped for good weather. The weather was expected to be 
acceptable, but there was a 40% chance that showers would force another delay. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours after liftoff, the five-man crew of the Discovery will deploy the 
Ulysses, built by the European Space Agency. The Ulysses will give scientists 
their first look ever at the poles of the sun and thus could help them 
understand such things as changes in solar temperatures that have a major 
impact on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But to go into a polar orbit around the sun, Ulysses must first fly to Jupiter, 
five times farther from the sun than is the Earth. It will pass over Jupiter 
close enough for the planet to fling the spacecraft down and into a huge orbit 
that will carry it over the poles of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever seen the poles of the sun because the Earth and the other 
planets orbit around the sun's Equator. That incomplete picture has left 
scientists guessing about how the poles influence such things as sunspots and 
solar flares, which in turn are thought to have an impact on weather patterns 
on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery's commander is Navy Capt. Richard N. Richards, 44, and the pilot 
is Marine Lt. Col. Robert D. Cabana, 41. Mission specialists are Air Force Maj. 
Thomas D. Akers, 39, and Navy Capt. William M. Shepherd, 41. The fifth member 
of the all-military crew is the first Coast Guardsman to fly in space, Cmdr. 
Bruce Melnick, 40, a mission specialist.

<TEXT>
   More than 450 years after the church tried
Galileo Galilei for heresy, Pope John Paul II came to the
astronomer's hometown and pronounced the words many Pisans have
longed to hear:
   Galileo was right and the church was wrong.
   The pope had previously said the Inquisition erred in condemning
Galileo for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun. But
his statements during a weekend trip to this Tuscan city were
viewed by its citizens as Galileo's official rehabilitation.
   Speaking Sunday at the University of Pisa, where Galileo studied
and taught in the late 1500s, John Paul said he wanted to recall
some of the school's illustrious alumni _ ``above all the very
great Galileo.''
   Shortly after his arrival in Pisa on Friday night, the pope
stood on a bridge over the Arno River, illuminated by flickering
candles, and declared:
   ``How can one not recall the name of that great man who was born
here and from here took the first steps toward immortal fame?
   ``Galileo Galilei, whose scientific work, imprudently opposed at
the beginning, is now recognized by all as an essential step in the
methodology of research and, in general, on the path toward the
knowledge of the world of nature.''
   Born in 1564, Galileo originally aroused antagonism when, as a
professor at the university from 1589 to 1592, he initiated
experiments on the laws of bodies in motion which contradicted the
accepted teachings of Aristotle.
   But he was most widely known for his support of the Copernicus
system, which taught that the sun is the central body and the earth
and the other planets revolve around it.
   That defied the church-held belief that the earth was the center
of the universe.
   In 1616, the church denounced the Copernicus system as dangerous
to faith, summoned Galileo to Rome and warned him not to uphold or
teach it.
   But he published a book supporting the theory in 1632. The next
year he was summoned to Rome, tried by the Inquisition and forced
to abjure his beliefs. Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment,
which was later changed to house arrest. He died in 1642 near
Florence.
   John Paul has often spoken out on Galileo's behalf.
   In 1979, less than a year after his election as pope, he urged
the international scientific community to examine the Galileo case,
saying he hoped it would help remove the ``diffidence that still
prevents fruitful harmony between science and faith, and between
the church and the world.''
   John Paul appointed a Vatican commission in 1979 to study the
case. Five years later, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences issued
documents from secret Vatican archives, including details of the
Inquisition proceedings, which uphold Galileo.
   In his speech at the university on Sunday, the pope did not
address the Galileo case specifically. But he noted that religious
faith and science have often been at odds throughout the centuries.
   John Paul warned of potential moral and ethical abuses of modern
science but said faith and research are not incompatible.
   ``The church trusts, promotes and encourages your task,'' he
said.

   A healthy Galileo spacecraft sped
unerringly toward distant Jupiter on Thursday, while the five
orbiting astronauts who released it measured the threatened ozone
layer that is Earth's natural sunscreen.
   Racing along at more than 9,000 mph, the probe Thursday night
was more than 260,000 miles out on its 2.4-billion-mile, six-year
journey to study the largest planet in the solar system in a search
for clues to how the universe began.
   Galileo was dispatched from Atlantis' cargo bay Wednesday night,
6{ hours after the shuttle was launched from Cape Canaveral.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials reported
Thursday the craft was in ``perfect shape'' and ``right on course.''
   Atlantis also was pronounced in ``excellent condition'' by
Mission Control after the crew members successfully restored a
cooling system that shut down Wednesday when it overheated and cut
in a backup unit.
   On Thursday, a major solar flare hurled a surge of radiation
toward Earth, but NASA officials said they were not concerned.
   Government scientists said the flare may disrupt communications
and electrical power transmission over the next two days, but NASA
said it had been evaluated and was not considered a problem for the
astronauts.
   ``In the orbit we're in, at 160-mile altitude, it is no threat
at all,'' said flight director Ronald D. Dittemore.
   The burst also has had no impact on Galileo, which is ``built
for much harsher environments than a solar flare,'' said NASA
spokeswoman Paula Cleggett-Haleim.
   Earlier Thursday, Mission Control wakened the space travelers
with a musical tribute to Atlantis commander Don Williams and pilot
Mike McCulley, both naval aviators and graduates of Purdue
University.
   Played were ``Hail Purdue'' and ``Anchors Aweigh,'' with
reveille sandwiched in between.
   The other crew members are Ellen Baker, Franklin Chang-Diaz and
Shannon Lucid.
   They began a series of medical, materials processing and other
experiments that will occupy their time until they return to Earth
on Monday. Landing is scheduled for Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
at 2:38 p.m. EDT Monday.
   On NASA satellite television Thursday night, Chang-Diaz and Mrs.
Baker demonstrated a retinal photography test on the shuttle's
middeck.
   With swimming goggles strapped around her head, Mrs. Baker
steadied herself while Chang-Diaz pressed a camera to the right
goggle to photograph her retina.
   Researchers said the camera slides should help them determine if
there are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Such
changes could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want to
determine if that is related to motion sickness in space.
   A new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in the
cargo bay to measure sections of the Earth's ozone layer, an area
of the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of the
sun's ultraviolet radiation.
   There is global concern over depletion of the ozone layer, and
many people fear its destruction will cause a rise in such human
health problems as skin cancer.
   The information gathered by the Atlantis crew will be compared
with data being collected at the same time and over the same areas
by nearly identical sensors aboard three older U.S. satellites.
   Researchers want the new data so they can accurately calibrate
the satellite sensors. NASA considers the experiment so important
that it has scheduled it for six more shuttle flights.
   ``Accurate, reliable measurements from space are critical to the
detection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential effects
and development of corrective measures,'' the agency said.
   Scientists report the ozone shield has thinned out worldwide by
about 3 percent within the last two decades, with the largest
losses occurring over the polar regions.
   The depletion is thought to be increased by the interaction of
certain manmade chemicals, principally chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, used as refrigerants and in the manufacturing of some plastic
products.
   Some U.S. manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans
to stop making the chemical or to guard against releasing it into
the atmosphere.
   Galileo, which slowed from its initial earth-escape velocity of
more than 25,000 mph, has a long way to go on its odyssey that will
take it on a scenic route through the solar system. Its path will
whip it once past Venus, twice around the Earth and within view of
an asteroid before it reaches Jupiter in December 1995.
   The roundabout route is necessary for the 6,000-pound spacecraft
to use the gravity forces of Venus and Earth to gain enough speed
to reach its target.
   Once at Jupiter, Galileo will fire a probe into the Jovian
atmosphere and then orbit the planet for a planned 22-month study.
   Scientists believe the probe could reveal much about the birth
of the universe.
   Because Jupiter has apparently undergone little change from its
beginnings, its composition is thought to resemble the cloud of gas
and dust from which the sun and planets formed. Galileo's
observations could give scientists a better idea of what the early
solar system looked like when it formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   Similarly, the Jovian atmosphere's hydrogen-to-helium ratio
promises to be a vital clue to the validity of the big-bang theory,
which holds that the universe was created in a single explosive
moment more than 15 billion years ago. The ratio is thought to be
about the same as was created at the time of the big bang.

   The robot probe Magellan streaked
across the solar system today at 25,000 mph on its way to Venus,
and the astronauts who launched the spacecraft turned to more
routine tasks aboard Atlantis.
   Deployment of the probe from the shuttle's cargo bay Thursday
night signaled a revival of an American planetary-science program
that has been dormant since 1978.
   ``The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are
operational and nominal. It couldn't be better,'' John Gerpheide,
Magellan project manager, said a few hours after the probe was
launched.
   Atlantis' fiery blastoff Thursday afternoon followed a
cliff-hanging, 59-minute wait that ground controllers and the five
astronauts endured because of the fickle Florida weather. With just
five minutes left in the shuttle's launch window, controllers found
a hole in the clouds and Atlantis thundered into the sky at 2:47
p.m. EDT.
   About six hours after the liftoff, Magellan was gently ejected
from the shuttle's cargo bay and the $550-million interplanetary
mission began.
   ``At last check, all systems were working exceptionally well on
Magellan,'' Mission Control commentator Jeffrey Carr said early
today.
   The space shuttle also was performing well, Carr said.
   Mission Control awoke the crew today at about 9:20 a.m. EDT with
a rousing rendition of the theme music from the movie ``Superman.''
   ``Good-morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,''
Mission Control told the crew.
   ``Good morning Houston,'' commander David Walker replied.
``We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our
toothbrushes.
   ``We thank you for that fine wake-up music,'' Walker said.
   During the rest of the mission, the astronauts will try to
photograph lightning systems at night and attempt to grow crystals
of indium by melting and then re-solidying the material.
   The crew members also will take other photographs of the Earth
as well as test various systems on the orbiter. Another planned
project includes taking saliva samples during the flight to
determine how an anti-motion sickness drug is absorbed by the body
in zero gravity.
   Atlantis, in orbit 184 miles above the Earth, is scheduled to
land Monday afternoon at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of the
rebirth of the planetary program,'' Gerpheide said. ``It's the
beginning of a really grand set of missions which will last for
quite a few years.''
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
Magellan's mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
Walker said when told Magellan had been launched on its journey.
   Magellan was the first planetary craft deployed from a space
shuttle.
   The Magellan is moving at a rate of 25,000 mph, relative to
Earth, meaning it travels about 416 miles in just sixty seconds. At
its current rate, Magellan could get from Washington D.C. to New
York in a minute and could fly coast-to-coast in about seven
minutes.
   But it will take the spacecraft 15 months to travel to Venus,
the cloud-shrouded planet that is 158 million miles away. The probe
will loop 1{ times around the sun and travel 806 million miles
before reaching its destination in August 1990.
   Once in orbit above Venus, Magellan is to use its radar system
to map up to 90 percent of the planet's surface. The
high-resolution radar is expected to produce images of objects as
small as a football field _ 10 times the clarity of any previous
pictures of Venus.
   Venus, where the surface temperature is 900 degrees, has long
intrigued scientists because it is close in size to the Earth but
so different in many other ways. The sun rises in the west because
Venus rotates the opposite direction of Earth, and its rotation is
so slow that a day there lasts 243 Earth days.
   Magellan, named for the 16th-century Portuguese explorer, needed
to be launched by May 28 or it would have had to wait two years for
Earth and Venus to again be in a favorable alignment.
   NASA had tried to launch Atlantis last Friday, but a flaw
detected in a fuel pump halted the liftoff. Engineers later found
what appeared to be a leak in a hydrogen fuel line, and both parts
were replaced before Thursday's launch.
   Crew members on the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and the
fourth since the Challenger disaster, are Walker, pilot Ronald
Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard, Mary Cleave and Mark
Lee.
   Magellan's mission marks the beginning of a new era in solar
system exploration that has been dormant since 1978 when the
Pioneer-Venus spacecraft was launched.
   In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo probe
on its way to Jupiter, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, Ulysses is to orbit the sun
in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.

   Atlantis' astronauts, safely in
orbit after a cliff-hanger weather delay, sent the Magellan
spacecraft streaking across the solar system Thursday night on a
$550 million mapmaking mission to Venus.
   The robot spacecraft, reviving an American planetary-science
program dormant for a decade, slipped from the shuttle's cargo bay
at 9:01 p.m. EDT and drifted into space.
   ``Magellan is deployed,'' reported shuttle commander David
Walker.
   An hour later, after Atlantis moved a safe distance away, both
stages of a spacecraft motor fired to start Magellan on a 456-day
journey to Venus, 158 million miles away. It will travel 806
million miles, looping 1{ times around the sun, before reaching and
orbiting its target in August 1990.
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
Magellan's mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
Walker replied when told both stages had fired.
   Minutes later Mission Control reported:
   ``Magellan is coming to life and is on a proper path toward
Venus, falling toward the sun.''
   Mission specialists Mark Lee and Mary Cleave, operating remote
controls inside the shuttle cabin, checked the health of the space
probe before sending a signal that spring-ejected it into its own
orbit while Atlantis soared over the Pacific Ocean 600 miles
southwest of Los Angeles.
   Magellan, the first planetary craft ever launched from a
shuttle, is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' cloud-shrouded
surface. Its high-resolution radar system is expected to produce
images of objects as small as a football field _ 10 times the
clarity of any previous pictures of the mysterious planet.
   The release of Magellan, the main task of the four-day flight,
came a little more than six hours after Atlantis thundered into
orbit 184 miles high.
   The launch was delayed 59 minutes by shifting clouds and winds
that had threatened the second postponement in six days. When
Atlantis finally left its pad, just five minutes remained in the
launch ``window'' dictated by the need to have the shuttle in the
proper position to dispatch Magellan to Venus.
   The launch team had advanced the countdown to the 5-minute mark
and held there, waiting for a break in the clouds that obscured a
runway near the launch pad where Atlantis would land in an
emergency.
   Chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying a weather scout plane,
found a break, signaled the go-ahead, and the count was started and
carried down to the blazing liftoff.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger. I'm glad you stuck with it,''
acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers said as he congratulated
the launch team.
   It was the 60th U.S. man-in-space flight, the 29th for the
shuttle and the fourth since the Challenger explosion more than
three years ago.
   ``Four of us are very happy to be back in space, and the fifth
one is very happy to be here,'' radioed Walker.
   Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Cleave and
Norman Thagard flew on previous shuttle flights. Lee is a rookie.
   ``Did somebody win the pool up there?'' mission control
commentator John Creighton asked the crew. ``We had only five
minutes left in the window.''
   ``We wouldn't want to push it any closer,'' replied Walker.
   The commander also reported Atlantis' separation from its
external fuel tank as it entered orbit was rougher than he
remembered on his first shuttle flight.
   ``It was more violent _ although I hate to use that word,'' he
said. ``It wasn't the soft separation I remembered from the
previous flight.''
   A launch attempt last Friday was halted with just 31 seconds to
go because of a short circuit in an engine fuel pump. Technicians
worked around the clock over the weekend to replace the pump and a
fuel line. NASA had to launch Magellan by May 28 or ground it for
two years until Earth and Venus were again in the proper alignment.
   Among tens of thousands who watched the rare afternoon liftoff
were some of the country's most renowned planetary scientists. They
have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978,
when Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last U.S. planetary
expedition.
   Success for Magellan would signal the start of a science-rich
three-year period during which five major probes will be rocketed
into space.
   ``The overture, the symphony, begins with Magellan,'' said NASA
science chief Lennard Fisk. ``It's going to be a long symphony.
It's going to have a lot of crescendos ... Nobody is going to
question our leadership in planetary science again.''
   Fisk hailed Magellan's flight as the start of a ``second golden
age'' of space science. The first was the period from the mid-1960s
to the late-1970s when unmanned spacecraft for the first time were
launched to make closeup examinations of Venus, Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Looking ahead, Fisk said that in August the Voyager 2 spacecraft
launched in 1977 will take the first close look at Neptune after a
planetary odyssey that earlier took it near Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus.
   In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo probe
on its way to Jupiter, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, Ulysses is to orbit the sun
in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.
   The planetary program had languished for 11 years because of a
combination of NASA budget cuts and the Challenger explosion that
delayed most of these missions more than three years.
   When Magellan reaches Venus in August 1990, it is to fire into
orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist.
   The radar is designed to pierce Venus sulfuric acid clouds and
produce images showing features as small as 100 yards across, the
size of a football field. In comparison, two 1983 Soviet spacecraft
captured features about 1,200 yards across and the 1978
Pioneer-Venus could not distinguish anything smaller than 60 miles
across.
   ``Everything we have learned about planetary science says that
Venus is the planet most like Earth,'' Saunders said. ``A major
question is why Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though
at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.''
   The surface temperature of Earth's sultry twin is 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure
is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   The atmosphere of Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide,
and the upper clouds, which hide the planet from view, are made up
of sulfuric acid droplets. Earlier exploration by unmanned
spacecraft have revealed continent-sized plateaus, deep canyons and
one of the highest mountains in the solar system.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.

   NASA's Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft
will zoom past Earth next week, taking pictures and making
measurements as if its home planet were an alien world.
   ``It will be the first time the Earth has been viewed from this
perspective. I expect it will give us a greater appreciation of
this place,'' said Bill O'Neil, project manager at the NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's close encounter with Earth will take place on Dec. 8
and is aimed at using the planet's gravity like a slingshot to send
the craft on the right path.
   The craft will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest
Atlantic Ocean at 12:35 p.m. PST Dec. 8. Galileo was 3.97 million
miles from Earth today.
   Galileo will be the first planetary craft to approach Earth from
space. So the flyby will be ``our first chance to look at Earth as
we have at other planets,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief
scientist, said Thursday.
   During its flyby, the spacecraft will measure gases that cause
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere and will
study high-altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy
Earth's ozone layer, Johnson said.
   Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from Earth, he added.
   Galileo is powered by two nuclear batteries - not reactors -
that use the decay of radioactive plutonium to produce electricity.
   Environmentalists unsuccessfully sued to halt Galileo's launch
for fear the plutonium could contaminate Earth's atmosphere. O'Neil
said the chance that Galileo will somehow plunge into Earth's
atmosphere and release its plutonium is less than one in 2 million.
   Even if it did happen, the plutonium would cause no more than 10
cancer deaths during the next 70 years, according to NASA.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from a space shuttle in October 1989 and is
scheduled to rendezvous with Jupiter in 1995 after a looping
2.4-billion-mile journey.
   Galileo's route was designed so the spacecraft could use Venus
and Earth as ``gravity slingshots.'' It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992.
   It used Venus as a gravity slingshot last February. Scientists
discussed their Venus findings on Thursday.
   Galileo's infrared camera made the first pictures of Venus'
middle and lower cloud decks. Pictures also were used to make a
movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph winds.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass trapping heat
in a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.

FT  13 SEP 94 / Technology: Bird's eye view of the sun - Today's high point
for Ulysses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ulysses, the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar
system, will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above
the south pole of the Sun.
The Dollars 750m (Pounds 480m) Ulysses mission is a joint project of the US
and European space agencies, dedicated to exploring the heliosphere. This
region contains mainly ions (charged atoms) and electrons emanating from the
Sun - a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar
space by the Sun's hot breath, the solar wind. It encompasses the whole
solar system, except for the planets and their atmospheres.
Because the planets were formed from a disc of debris around the newborn Sun
about 5bn years ago, they all lie within one plane, known as the ecliptic,
which is tilted only slightly from the Sun's equatorial plane.
To explore the solar wind and magnetic field, free of the turbulence and
other complications caused by the planets, John Simpson of the University of
Chicago proposed in 1959 sending a space probe over the Sun's poles. The
idea became technically feasible in the 1970s, and in 1977 the European
Space Agency agreed to collaborate with Nasa on the Ulysses project.
No rocket is strong enough on its own to send a spacecraft out of the
ecliptic, because it has to cancel Earth's motion around the Sun of 30
km/sec and build up speed in a new direction. But Ulysses' designers
realised that they could use the gravitational pull of the giant planet
Jupiter to propel their car-sized probe into a new plane, like a slingshot
(see diagram).
All went well from 1977 until 1980, when the project began an odyssey of
setbacks and delays, caused mainly by technical and financial difficulties
at Nasa. Ulysses was eventually launched on a Space Shuttle in October 1990,
seven and a half years after the original target date.
Once in space, Ulysses performed perfectly. Project scientists took
advantage of its swing past Jupiter in February 1992 to make the first
detailed survey of the gigantic system of electrical currents, particles and
magnetic fields surrounding the planet.
On route to the Sun's south pole, the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses
have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere: shock waves
in the solar wind; electromagnetic waves with a very long period (more than
10 hours); regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun; enormous
clouds of ionised gas; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from
elsewhere in the galaxy. The investigators are still working out the
significance of these observations.
'This is our first ever 'bird's eye view' of the Sun's magnetic poles,' says
Roger Bonnet, Esa's science director. 'This new perspective will cast some
light on the origins of the solar wind and is going to improve our models of
the solar interior.
'It may also enable us to anticipate better the variations of solar activity
and forecast their effect on Earth,' he adds. For example, Ulysses may give
some clues about the impact of the 11-year sunspot cycle on terrestrial
climate.
Although the mission has taken so long to gestate and execute, some
old-timers are still involved. Willis Meeks, Nasa's Ulysses project manager,
has been working on it for 16 years. And Simpson, the 'father of Ulysses',
is in charge of the largest of the nine experiments, which looks at the
behaviour of cosmic rays in the solar wind. 'I have had plenty of
opportunities to fly experiments on other missions,' he says. 'But Ulysses
remains unique, as the first and only foreseeable mission to the polar
regions of the Sun's heliosphere.'
The spacecraft's new polar orbit will carry it over the Sun's north pole
next summer. Although current plans call for the mission to end in October
1995, Esa and Nasa are keen to continue observing until the end of 2001.
They say the modest extra cost, Dollars 50m, would pay large scientific
dividends because the current observations coincide with a quiet period on
the Sun, whereas 2000-2001 will be a period of maximum solar activity.
Whatever happens next, Ulysses has already paid off in Simpson's eyes. 'We
don't have to wonder any longer whether the results will justify the effort
and reward the long wait,' he says. 'We already know they do.'

   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past Neptune this week for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at JPL,'' joked Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, Sunday was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from Florida on Aug. 20, 1977.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' said Jurrie van der Woude, a JPL spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday, when Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   As of 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction Monday morning, NASA engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the Neptune flyby.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct
daily news conferences starting Monday and continuing through Aug.
29.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of Neptune's
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were discovered from Earth. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on Earth, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle Saturn and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting Neptune.
   _A magnetic field surrounding Neptune, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like Earth's northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   The Neptune encounter is the climax of the $865 million,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Haynes said Monday's course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind
Neptune.
   Ellis Miner, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine Neptune's atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside Neptune.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to Earth
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, Miner said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to Earth, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with Neptune, Voyager will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, Voyager will start a 49-minute trip through
Neptune's shadow. Instead of photographing Neptune during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 is converging on
Neptune, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager
at the National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on Nep
a giant storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, Voyager will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
Neptune's north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, Voyager will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, Triton. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.
   Neptune, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times Earth's size and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit
Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting Neptune, said
physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from Earth, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
Earth's hurricanes or Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving Neptune's storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
Neptune _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, Stone said.
   Despite any internal heat, Neptune receives 900 times less
sunlight than Earth, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on Triton,
Stone said.
   Scientists believe Triton _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of Earth's moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Scientists say pictures of the far side
of the moon taken by the spacecraft Galileo will help fill a blank
spot on the map of the planet.
   The pictures, taken as Galileo sped past the moon and Earth on
its six-year voyage to Jupiter, also should reveal more about the
mineral content of the moon's crust, scientists said Monday.
   ``We're actually doing some new observation,'' said James Head,
a member of Galileo's imaging team at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration displayed
black and white photos of the full moon that provided a sharp image
of the Orientale Basin as well as portions of both the near and far
sides of the moon.
   The spacecraft swung into the Earth's gravitational field
Saturday, hurtling 597 miles above the western Atlantic at the
point of its closest approach.
   By sweeping near Earth, Galileo was able to use gravitational
pull like a slingshot to increase its speed by 11,600 mph, boosting
its velocity to 79,000 mph in relation to the sun.
   Galileo's approach allowed scientists to focus the craft's
cameras on the far side of the moon for the first exploration of
the region since NASA's Apollo missions in the 1970s.
   The cameras photographed a wedge of moonscape near the south
pole on the far side that somehow was missed by previous U.S. and
Soviet mapping missions, said project scientist Torrence Johnson.
   ``That's interesting, it's got craters just like the rest of the
moon, but there's no great scientific surprise in that,'' Johnson
said.
   A subsequent journey through the Earth's magnetic field gave
scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which
magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels.
   The data could reveal whether the majority of these ions, which
trigger colorful auroras near Earth's magnetic poles, come from the
sun or Earth, said Lou Frank, chairman of Galileo's magnetic field
working group.

   Some statistics known about Neptune as
Voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight:
   DIAMETER: About 30,700 miles, nearly four time's Earth's diameter
and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus,
which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31,760 miles.
   MOONS: Two majorones, Triton and Nereid, plus at least four
others discovered so far by Voyager 2. Triton, four-fifths the size
of Earth's moon, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit
a planet backwards. That suggests it once was a sun-orbiting comet
that hit a Neptunian moon and was ``captured'' into orbit around
Neptune.
   RINGS: So far Voyager has found Neptune is orbited by one
complete ring of debris, and one ring arc, or partial ring, which
scientists believe also may prove to be a complete ring upon closer
inspection.
   DAY LENGTH: Surface wind suggests Neptune takes nearly 18 hours
to spin on its axis, but Voyager's measurements indicate a day on
Neptune is closer to 16 hours, the time it takes for the bulk of the
planet's interior to rotate.
   YEAR LENGTH: Neptune takes 165 Earth years to make a single orbit
around the sun. That means a winter on Neptune lasts more than 40
Earth years.
   DISTANCE FROM SUN: Orbits the sun at an average distance of 2.793
billion miles, 30 times as far as Earth and invisible to the naked
eye from Earth. Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun,
but because of Pluto's elongated orbit it is now the ninth and
outermost.
   WEATHER: A chilly 307 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at an
altitude where the atmospheric pressure is twice that at sea level
on Earth. Voyager has revealed cirrus-like clouds, 400-mph wind and
an Earth-sized cyclone and other storms in Neptune's atmosphere. The
source of the internal heat creating Neptune's weather is a mystery;
Earth's comes from decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   ATMOSPHERE: Primarily hydrogen and helium, but Neptune appears
pale blue-green because enough methane, the major component of
natural gas, is present to absorb red light.
   STRUCTURE: Scientists suspect that a third of the way toward
Neptune's center the atmosphere gives way to a slurry of water and
rock, with no distinct sky-sea boundary.
   DISCOVERY: In 1846, by Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis
d'Arrest at the Berlin Observatory. Neptune was discovered because
its presence was predicted based on disturbances in Uranus' orbit.

   Three weeks after its launch from a
shuttle, the Galileo spacecraft fired its thrusters Thursday to
begin the first of about 30 course changes needed for its
roundabout six-year trip to Jupiter.
   ``We've started the first trajectory correction maneuver,''
mission director Neal Ausman said after the three-day series of
thruster ignitions got under way at 8:31 a.m. PST.
   During the maneuver, Galileo is firing four of its 12 thrusters
in a series of pulses, he said. No individual pulse exceeds two
minutes, each set of pulses takes about 45 minutes, and the entire
maneuver will be completed Saturday night.
   Two other thrusters may be used to correct the spacecraft's rate
of spin and the direction toward which it points, said Ausman, of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The trajectory change is meant to aim Galileo for its flight
past Venus in February. The spacecraft, launched from space shuttle
Atlantis on Oct. 18, will swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so
the planets can act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo
toward Jupiter during the $1.9 billion mission.
   On Thursday, Galileo was about 31 million miles into its looping
2.4 billion-mile journey to the solar system's largest planet,
Ausman said. It was about 4.6 million miles from Earth and 58.5
million miles from Venus, traveling at 60,376 mph relative to the
sun.
   In July 1995, Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe.
The orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months starting in December
1995, the same month the probe will parachute into the Jovian
atmosphere, making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed
by intense pressure.
   About 30 course corrections involving thruster firings spread
over 135 days will be required en route to Jupiter, Ausman said.
   Galileo has ignited its 3.5 inch-long thrusters on other
occasions, but those firings were to adjust spin or direction,
Ausman said. The three-day maneuver that started Thursday is
Galileo's first trajectory correction, he added.
   Ausman said the West German-built thrusters have to fire in
pulses to avoid contaminating sensitive parts of Galileo. The
thrusters are attached to the spinning part of Galileo, and can
fire only when they are not above sensitive areas on the
non-spinning section of the spacecraft.
   The thrusters also are fired in pulses because NASA fears
continuous firing might make them overheat and burn through, a
problem that developed on the same type of thrusters on two
satellites in recent years, Ausman said.

   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977. They visited Jupiter in
1979 and Saturn in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in 1986. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of Jupiter, Saturn
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of Neptune.
   At a cost Haynes pegged at $865 million through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.

   After the Magellan spacecraft goes into
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 97 percent carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into Venus' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on Earth's surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on Earth.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth. Venus' surface is about 65 percent
rolling plains, 27 percent flat lowlands and 8 percent highlands
that may be similar to Earth's continents.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting Venus now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.

   The Ulysses spacecraft is wobbling like
an off-balance washing machine, threatening to cripple the $750
million U.S.-European mission to study the sun's poles.
   Ulysses, launched from space shuttle Discovery on Oct. 6,
started gyrating on Nov. 4, The Associated Press learned.
   Officials this week confirmed the problem's existence, and said
they hope they can work around the malfunction so it doesn't
significantly harm Ulysses' five-year mission.
   The wobble will leave the spacecraft's main dish-shaped antenna
unable to point at Earth continuously.
   ``If we can't do anything about it, it's very serious,'' said
Edgar Page, Ulysses science coordinator for the European Space
Agency. The loss of data could range from 20 percent to 90 percent,
he said.
   The data is to be transmitted to Earth during 1994-1995, when
the spacecraft would be the first to orbit the sun's polar regions.
   Engineers hope to minimize the wobble during critical periods by
repeatedly firing the spacecraft's thrusters.
   ``Gloom is something I don't feel,'' said Willis Meeks, Ulysses
project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I'm sure
that somehow during the next four years we'll find a way to learn
to live with this problem.''
   Page said that for several tense days late last month, mission
officials worried that they might permanently lose contact with the
$250 million spacecraft.
   Ulysses' trouble is yet another in a series of problems for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Others include a
flawed mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope, space shuttle fuel
leaks and a malfunctioning Astro observatory on the most recent
shuttle flight.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory here has successfully handled
balky spacecraft, including a stuck camera platform on one of the
Voyagers and Magellan's radio blackouts.
   Ulysses is a joint mission of the European Space Agency, which
supplied the spacecraft and half its science instruments, and NASA,
which built the remaining instruments, launched the spacecraft and
is tracking it.
   On Friday, it was 40.6 million miles from Earth, flying toward a
1992 encounter with Jupiter.
   The planet's gravity will act like a slingshot to hurl Ulysses
toward solar orbit. Ulysses is supposed to loop around the sun's
south pole during May-September 1994 and over its north pole during
May-September 1995.
   The slow wobble, technically called ``nutation,'' suddenly
developed Nov. 4 when Ulysses extended a 24{-foot-long antenna
boom. The boom, designed to study radio signals in space and waves
in the solar wind, may have become bent.
   ``It is a very big wobble. We were all amazed,'' Page told AP
Network News.
   The wobble diminished in recent days as Ulysses moved farther
from the sun and the antenna is shaded by the spacecraft, Meeks
said.
   Because of that, the leading suspected culprit is that heat from
the sun bent the boom, Meeks and Page said.
   If the theory is right, the wobble soon should disappear for a
while, but Page said it will return during the critical times when
Ulysses is studying the sun's poles.
   Ulysses doesn't need to get close to the sun, only fly past the
poles. So it never will be closer to the sun than it was on the day
it was launched.
   Engineers theorize the bent boom makes Ulysses wobble as it
spins, much like an off-centered washing machine agitator. The
spacecraft was designed to spin so it wouldn't wobble. The boom
can't be retracted.
   Page said he didn't think Ulysses' builder, Dornier Deutsche
Aerospace of Germany, was to blame. The company ``appeared to
satisfy all the test requirements we had,'' he said.

<HEAD>Galileo Probe Rebuilt For October Launch, 1995 Plunge Into Jovian
Skies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A space probe grounded for 3{ years by
the Challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an October launch to
Jupiter, where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the
birth of the solar system.
   The $1.36 billion Galileo mission should climax in December 1995,
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75
minutes before it is crushed by Jupiter's intense atmospheric
pressure.
   Its mother ship, the Galileo orbiter, will circle the planet for
22 months.
   Hughes Aircraft Co. planned to deliver the refurbished $157
million Galileo probe late this afternoon in Pasadena, where NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL on its way to Jupiter,'' Hughes Vice President Steven Dorfman
said at a news conference Tuesday.
   JPL will send the 4-foot-diameter, teardrop-shaped probe to
Kennedy Space Center in Florida in late April, followed by the
orbiter in mid-May. The probe and orbiter then will be hooked up
together, placed atop a booster rocket, and finally loaded into the
cargo bay of the shuttle Atlantis.
   The shuttle, set for launch no earlier than Oct. 12 and no later
than about Nov. 21, will release the combined Galileo spacecraft
into Earth orbit. Then Galileo's rocket will fire, sending the
orbiter and probe on a circuitous, 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage
to the solar system's largest planet, which is the fifth planet from
the sun and is about 400 million miles from Earth.
   En route to the giant gaseous planet, Galileo will observe two
asteroids. The probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they
reach Jupiter, then fly in tandem until the probe enters the
atmosphere at 115,000 mph. The probe will deploy a parachute and
descend about 370 miles through Jovian skies until it is crushed by
pressure more than 25 times Earth's atmosphere.
   Data from the probe will help scientists better understand the
origin of Jupiter, the solar system and the universe, said Richard
Young, Galileo probe project scientist at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
   Scientists believe the Jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the
original material from which stars are formed, according to a Hughes
statement.
   The orbiter will measure Jupiter's electrical particle and
magnetic fields, and snap 50,000 photographs of the planet and its
moons, including Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, which were
discovered in 1610 by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.
   The spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle
in May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to Jupiter. But Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986, killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet
until last fall.
   After the tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. Galileo's route to
Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years
to six because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as
they were in 1986 and because Galileo's new solid-fueled booster is
less powerful.
   The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging.
   White House approval for the launch is expected in September,
said Richard Spehalski, Galileo project manager at JPL. Such
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium. A NASA
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with Galileo is very
small.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud-shrouded Venus for the best
look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky
at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting NASA administrator
Dale Meyers.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft Magellan, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The $550 million craft, which had to be launched
by May 28 or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. Magellan is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the Kennedy Space Center emergency landing site.
   NASA's first attempt to launch Atlantis last Friday was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander David M.
Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard,
Mary Cleave and Mark Lee.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send Magellan out of Earth orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching Venus.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above Earth
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path Magellan
must follow to reach Earth's mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until May 28. At that point, Earth and Venus would have moved out
of alignment and the Magellan mission would not be possible for two
years.
   Magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a U.S. planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but Venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The Earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by Venus because it is so close in size
to Earth, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the Earth, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on Earth, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that Venus' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   Magellan will rendezvous with Venus in August 1990. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to Earth for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   Magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what Lennard Fisk, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
America's planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in 1978, was the last U.S. space launch and Fisk
said America ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly past Neptune in August. It
earlier visted Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In October, the robot
craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in 1990,
and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said Fisk.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on June 22 when it was
57.2 million miles from Neptune. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released Wednesday by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which called it ``the
best color photo of Neptune taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its Aug. 24 close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from Earth, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of Neptune. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot or Earth's
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on Jupiter, Saturn and apparently on Neptune are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe Earth's jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said Hansen and Caltech planetary
scientist Andrew Ingersoll.
   Jupiter's 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on Neptune,
Stone said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on Saturn, he added.
   Stone said that on Jupiter, and possibly Neptune, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. Jupiter's
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from Neptune to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
Neptune's atmosphere, said Rich Terrile, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying Neptune's atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' Terrile said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., in 1977.
   They explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in 1980
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and will fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's north pole cloudtops at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   Five hours later it will encounter Neptune's backward-orbiting
moon, Triton, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
Pluto's elongated orbit Neptune will be the ninth and outermost
until 2007.

   Five astronauts tracked a perfect
countdown Thursday as technicians prepared the shuttle Atlantis for
a midafternoon launch on Friday. The mission will propel NASA's
``Magellan'' probe to Venus and revive America's deep-space science
program.
   ``After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious
to get started,'' said John H. Gerpheide, Magellan project manager.
   Officials described the countdown as the smoothest of four since
the Challenger disaster. The chance of high winds provided slight
concern as NASA looked forward to liftoff in an unusually tight
launch window that opens at 2:24 p.m. EDT and lasts justs 23
minutes.
   Magellan, ready for its 15-month flight to Venus, ``is 100
percent healthy and ticking along,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's
chief scientist. ``We're ready to go fly,'' said Richard Truly, who
heads the shuttle program and is the incoming NASA administrator.
   Earlier Thursday, three Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth,
leaving the Mir space station unattended for the first time in more
than two years. Two of the cosmonauts had been in space for five
months, the other for eight months.
   Atlantis' cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar
system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of
Venus and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million, not
including the $225 million cost of the four-day shuttle flight.
   Magellan's radar images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by
computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about
the size of a football field. That is 10 times sharper than
previous pictures of the planet.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the radar
images could help scientists understand how Venus was formed and
might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how Earth and
Venus evolved so differently even though they were almost identical
when the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   The Magellan deployment is scheduled 6 hours 18 minutes after
liftoff, with astronauts Mark Lee and Mary Cleave conducting a
countdown from inside their shuttle cabin. An hour after the
release, a rocket is to fire to hurl the 7,600-pound unmanned probe
on a 450-day journey to Venus, a complex trip that takes Magellan
one and one-half times around the sun before it intercepts its
target planet.
   The Atlantis crew also includes commander David Walker, pilot
Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard. Lee is the only
one who has not flown on a previous shuttle mission.
   Spending cutbacks and delays forced by the 1986 Challenger
accident prompted NASA to use the roundabout approach to Venus. The
trip could have been made in four months under better circumstances.
   The first American planetary mission since 1978 will mark the
beginning of a busy year for NASA's planetary program. ``In August
the Voyager spacecraft will fly by Neptune and in October we'll
launch Galileo (from the shuttle) to Jupiter,'' Gerpheide said.
   At a briefing for reporters Thursday, NASA's Fisk vowed, ``No
one is going to question our leadership in planetary (flight)
again.''
   The Atlantis countdown began Tuesday and was progressing so
smoothly Thursday that the launch team had time to relax during a
15-hour halt of the clock. The time had been set aside for catchup
work.
   ``We just don't have anything out there that we're worried
about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue
that way,'' said countdown director Ron Phelps.
   Weather officers said they were keeping one eye on scattered
clouds which were moving into the skies above Moron, Spain, where
an airbase serves as an emergency landing site in the event of a
problem after launch.
   The astronauts were briefed throughout the day on the status of
the countdown and reviewed their flight plans. They were to retire
early Friday, arising about 9 a.m. to prepare for the afternoon
launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after
noon.
   Magellan is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90
percent of the surface during 243 Earth days, equal to one Venusian
day.
   Low resolution pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft hint at
Earth-like mountain ranges and rolling plains, but the surface
temperature on Venus is 900 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is
90 times that of Earth's.
   The last planetary mission launched by the United States was the
1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take
the first closeup look at Neptune in August after earlier exploring
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Other major science projects planned in the next three years are
the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope from a shuttle early next
year, the Ulysses probe to study the sun in October, 1990, and the
Mars Observer spacecraft in 1992.
