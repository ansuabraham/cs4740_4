   An American inventor and wildlife
researchers at Kruger National Park say they have achieved a major
breakthrough in conservation _ an immunization system that can stop
epidemics in free-ranging animals.
   The breakthrough is the bio-bullet, a vaccine in a biodegradable
projectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter. It
has been used for three years to immunize animals ranging from
warthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped out
species in the park, a 7,800-square-mile reserve.
   Anthrax is endemic in the northern part of the park, an area
where 200 rare roan antelope roam. Before 1970, when the park began
an inoculation program by firing disposable darts at the animals
from the air, severe outbreaks had affected most of the herd animals.
   ``If we have another major outbreak, we have a method now of
controlling the epidemic,'' said Valerius de Vos, head of research
at Kruger. ``I consider this a major breakthrough. ... It will be
used widely in the future.''
   How widely depends to some extent on politics. While South
Africa's wildlife management program is regarded as the best on the
continent, its experts seldom visit other African countries where
similar problems exist. Black African governments restrict contact
with South Africa because of apartheid, its system of racial
separation.
   ``It's a pity,'' de Vos said. ``The rest of Africa needs us and
we need them. We've got expertise and we need interaction.''
   For instance, the numbers of endangered black rhinos are
increasing in South Africa but declining elsewhere. Due to South
African conservation efforts, the white rhino was removed from the
endangered category worldwide.
   Representatives of private wildlife groups sometimes come to
South Africa, and exchanges take place by mail, but many Western
universities won't send copies of research papers to Kruger's
scientists.
   Gus Mills, the chief predator researcher, made a tape recording
of hyena territorial cries and plays it from a jeep at night.
   ``All the hyena in the area come around to listen and we can
count them,'' he said. ``I've sent my tape to Kenya and now Kenyan
hyenas are listening to South African hyenas.''
   De Vos said the air-rifle that fires the bio-bullet can be
locally produced, but not the bullet itself. He worries what
sanctions could disrupt the immunization program.
   There has been talk of banning shipments of four-wheel drive
vehicles to South Africa from Japan, because they have military
potential.
   ``That's going to affect us,'' de Vos said. ``I don't know what
we're going to do, but I guess we can keep going with two-wheel
drive vehicles.''
   In 1973 de Vos and his team began inoculating large mammals by
firing dart-syringes from the air. Disadvantages included large
numbers of plastic darts left on the ground, and the time and cost
of manufacturing the syringes.
   De Vos found Fred Paul, an inventor from White Bear Lake, Minn.,
who had developed the bio-bullet and used it to vaccinate domestic
livestock and wild bighorn sheep. Paul came to Kruger Park to assist
the research, which includingfiring different-sized bullets at
varying velocities until the right size and shape were determined.
   The bullet can be fired rapidly, allowing marksmen to inoculate
about 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy. The material, a
cellulose polymer, dissolves inside the animal, releasing the
vaccine.
   Vaccinating 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy is
``impressive, to say the least. ... That's a lot of animals,'' said
Maurice LeFranc, director of the Institute for Wildlife Research, a
branch of National Wildlife Federation in the United States.
   The South African park lends itself to such an effort because it
has wide open spaces and concentrations of animals, LeFranc said in
Vienna, Va.
   The project illustrates the place that South African wildlife
researchers have in the forefront of species preservation and the
National Park Board's philosophy about when to let nature take its
course and when man should intervene.
   ``South Africa has taken a real strong leadership in the
preservation and conservation of their wildlife,'' said Dr. Werner
Heuschele, an endangered species specialist at the San Diego Zoo in
California. ``Some of their game parks are among the best managed in
the world.''
   One researcher at Kruger is capturing impala to find a cure for a
human-caused stress disease that occurs when antelope are chased for
long distances and caught in a net. In the wild, predators chase
impalas only for short distances.
   The main form of research at Kruger is surveillance _ taking
aerial photos of vegetation, counting animals, taking blood levels
of elephants to see if car exhaust affects them. The data is fed
into computers to help determine what projects are needed in the
park, a fenced area the size of Massachusetts.
   Roads affect the natural spread of fire, so controlled fires are
set deliberately. Fenced animals cannot migrate during drought, so
dams are built.
   In the early 1970s, wildebeest rapidly diminished. A new fence
around the park had cut off one herd's traditional migration route,
and heavy rainfall encouraged long grass, rather than the short
grass the wildebeest like.
   Managers could have set fires to eliminate the tall grass.
Instead, they decided to kill off lions and hyenas who preyed on the
wildebeest.
   To prevent the need for such action in the future, Mills and his
team spend two weeks at a time following lions, cheetah and
leopards, to monitor their eating habits.
   ``Are they depressing the prey in large numbers or living in
harmony with their environment?'' Mills says researchers want to
know.
   Although anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease are natural African
diseases, they are controlled because it would take 20 to 30 years
for the herds to recover after an endemic.
   ``Drastic fluctuations in animal populations are part of nature,
but we can't afford that,'' said de Vos.
   ``We cull (shoot) buffalo and elephant, and sometimes hippo.
These are species that can outgrow the system. The rest of the
animals are controlled by the system. Drought, predation, disease
all act as controls. For the buffalo and elephant the main predator
in the past was man. We have taken man out of it, so now we're
bringing man back in, in a controlled way.''

   A hyena that accidentally locked
itself in the bathroom at a game park got the last laugh _ it tore
the room apart and opened the shower tap, flooding the house.
   The Star newspaper said Friday the hyena spent 24 hours in the
bathroom last weekend at the house in Skukuza, a village in Kruger
National Park in eastern South Africa. It apparently wandered into
the house while the occupants were away.
   The hyena pulled down curtains, ripped the medicine chest from
the wall, smashed the toilet seat, damaged a towel rail and bit
into aerosal shaving cream and deodorant cans, the Star said.
   It also turned on the shower, causing overflowing water to seep
under the door into the rest of the house, the newspaper said.
   Neighbors saw water coming out from under the front door and
alerted game rangers, who shot the hyena with a tranquilizer dart
through the bathroom window. Tests on the animal indicated no
serious injuries, and the hyena was released.

FT  02 APR 94 / Travel: Survival is a dogfight for the wild bunch - Wild
dogs in Africa may become rarer than the rhino. Michael J Woods tracked them
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a dull pock, like the sound of a tennis ball bouncing lightly on
grass, as the compressed air-gun expelled its tranquilliser dart. The
African wild dog sprang to its feet as if it had been stung. With a yelp it
dashed off, a red woollen tassel dangling from the syringe in its shoulder.
'It won't go far,' said Dr Gus Mills, and we sat in his truck for the 10
minutes needed for the drug to work. It took a little time to find the
sleeping dog in the thick bush, as its black, white and tan blotched coat
blended remarkably well with the broken shadows cast on the grey dusty soil.
Once located, though, a radio collar was swiftly fitted, a sample of blood
taken and the antidote injected. In less than a minute the dog was on its
feet and had gone to join the rest of Mbyamiti pack, which now had two dogs
carrying radio transmitters.
Gus Mills is a scientist who works in Kruger national park, a long
rectangular area about the size of Wales on the eastern boundary of South
Africa. He has been researching African wild dogs, also known as Cape
hunting dogs, for some years. His subjects are rangy animals with noticeably
large rounded ears, three-coloured coats and a height of a little over 2ft.
They are efficient hunters, running as a pack and killing at dawn and dusk
if they can, and lying-up in shade during the heat of the day. Only for the
short breeding period are they tied to a den; for the rest of the year they
are nomadic and appear to need a large territory to survive.
There are only about 360 wild dogs in Kruger; the lion and hyena populations
both top 2,000 for the same area. All is not well with wild dogs. They have
become very scarce in Africa - rarer, some say, than the rhino, which makes
them Africa's most threatened large carnivore.
Historically, their undeservedly bad reputation has led to persecution by
farmers. Until 20 years ago, they were even shot in some national parks.
There are still farmers who will not tolerate dogs and consider them vermin,
so that packs straying from conservation areas are at risk.
Only big stretches of protected wilderness will suffice to provide wild dogs
with enough space to survive. The national parks in the north of Botswana
and Zimbabwe and in the south of Tanzania fulfil these requirements, and
contain reasonable numbers of dogs. But these very extensive areas are
largely unpenetrated by roads and, for the discerning visitor, for whom a
glimpse of a dog is more exciting than any of the big five (lion, leopard,
elephant, rhino, buffalo), spotting one is extremely difficult.
Things seem to be slightly easier in Kruger. Finding them by radio is the
only way that researchers such as Gus Mills can ensure that packs are
monitored on a regular basis, and dogs are often seen by visitors to the
park. In fact, Gus was able to use tourist sightings of wild dogs to obtain
a measure of the number of animals in the park.
By offering a free film for every usable photograph of a dog, he soon had
pictures of almost every animal. The dog population in Kruger is one of the
densest so far recorded in Africa, and the extensive network of roads is
frequently used by packs on the move.
'Morning and evening are the best times to look for dogs,' Gus told me.
'That is when they hunt, for they rest in the heat of the day and then their
low profile and disruptive coloration make them almost impossible to spot.'
Kruger has much to offer in addition to wild dogs. I came across lions and
elephants in abundance along with rhino and giraffes. Many of the smaller
animals, so often missed elsewhere, are visible here, too. I found a dwarf
mongoose den by the roadside and was able to watch the lightning activities
of its delightful inhabitants as they foraged through the undergrowth and
then rocketed across open areas for fear of raptors.
On two occasions I had to wait for leopard tortoises to cross the track and
once swerved to avoid a chameleon, bright green against the khaki sand,
rocking its way so very slowly over the ruts.
But it was wild dogs I wanted to see, and the more I questioned Gus Mills,
the more mysteries I encountered. Packs, for instance, fluctuate markedly in
size, and Kruger's Skukuza pack, which numbered 40 dogs in 1989, now
consists of just three males.
Dogs disappear in large numbers for no apparent reason, and bodies are
rarely found. This was the reason for putting a collar on a second animal of
the Mbyamiti pack, as an insurance against the death or disappearance of the
dog already collared.
In Kruger, a wild dog's expectation of life is unusually short - rarely
beyond four years (a hyena's is about 15). Gus has heard several accounts of
lions killing both adults and pups, and would like to investigate more fully
the role lions play in the lives of dogs.
Fortunately, international awareness is growing. The Kruger wild dog study
is funded by the National Parks Board and the independent Stuart Bromfield
Wild Dog Fund of the Endangered Wildlife Trust. This trust also finances
other wild dog projects in South Africa, along with the newly-established
Licaone Fund in Italy.
Meanwhile, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has
published an action plan for African wild dogs, so there is considerable
hope for the future.
I spent a week in Kruger, and it wasn't until my last day that I found dogs
for myself. The sun was sinking and, briefly, painting the bush a golden
green. The insects were tuning up for their evening chorus and the cacophony
of guinea fowl was at its loudest. There was a sudden snort from an impala
ram in the undergrowth beside the vehicle and he quickly made himself
scarce.
Then I was aware that, coming towards me along the road ahead, were a dozen
lean dark silhouettes with familiar big round ears. The long legs carrying
those lithe bodies touched the ground so lightly that the animals almost
seemed to float along in a distance-devouring trot. I stopped quickly and
the grinning dogs went by. The sun lit them for a second, then they wheeled
and melted into the trees - a moment of pure magic.
Michael Woods was a guest of the South African Tourism Board (London tel:
081-944-8080) and Kruger national park.
He flew from Bristol to Amsterdam with KLM and then caught its long-haul
flight to Johannesburg. KLM runs a similar service from 16 UK regional
airports, thus avoiding the often time-consuming journey to London and the
two-hour check-in.

<LEADPARA>  THE question of who first isolated the AIDS virus, a subject of heated debate
between researchers in France and America for more than six years, may have
been at least partly resolved Monday.;    A major puzzle emerged when the two
original strains isolated by Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Institutes of
Health and Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in France turned out to
be virtually identical.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     According to a paper to be published this week in Science magazine, a new
finding by Montagnier points strongly to lab contaminations. Both sides now
seem to agree that a particularly fast-multiplying strain of the virus
apparently contaminated samples in Montagnier's lab. Unaware the contamination
had occurred, the French lab sent the samples to Gallo's lab. The aggressive
strain then apparently contaminated samples in the American lab as well.;   
Both labs ended up reporting virtually identical strains, and accusations of
misappropriation flew.; Bugs defended; A plan to turn insects into astronauts
is bugging animal rights activists.;    Amateur rocketeers plan to launch
model rockets filled with bees and grasshoppers next year in recognition of
the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World.;   
High school and college students would build the rockets for experiments in
which they would measure temperature, air pressure and radiation surrounding
the rockets and observe the insects through video cameras.;    The creatures
and the equipment would parachute back to earth. But the Humane Society and
other groups say blasting bugs is cruel and a waste of time.; New telescope;
An $40 million array of radio telescope antennas will be built atop Mauna Kea,
an extinct volcano in Hawaii, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
announced Monday.;    The antennas will work together as a single unit, to be
called the Submillimeter Telescope Array. They will operate in a narrow band
of short wavelengths between infrared and radio in the electromagnetic
spectrum. With this band scientists can look into the center of exploding
galaxies and pierce the halos of comets and the atmospheres of planets.; Hyena
siblicide; Carrying sibling rivalry to an extreme, hour-old spotted hyenas
routinely attack their younger siblings just moments after birth, report
scientists at the University of California, Berkeley.;    The practice has
been observed in some birds but never before in mammals. Berkeley zoologist
Dr. Laurence G. Frank speculated that the attacks might be due to high levels
of two male hormones present at birth in both males and females.;    Spotted
hyenas normally give birth to litters of two cubs. Both are born with open
eyes and a full set of incisors and are immediately capable of strong,
coordinated action.;    In the wild, the attacks can result in death from
infection or the inability to nurse. At Berkeley, the scientists filming the
births in pens rescued the second cub. Their findings are reported in the
current issue of Science.  </TEXT>

TRAVEL VIDEOS: FROM AFRICAN PLAINS TO THE JUNGLE OF COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month we'll study a couple of new -- and excellent -- videos, one dealing 
with Africa, the other with Costa Rica. And while both deal with wildlife 
conservation, the Costa Rica video involves other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa" (two videos), Eco Ventures, 45 minutes each (1988). These two 
remarkable videos, produced by Megan Epler Wood and narrated by George 
Plimpton, will be of special interest to African safari planners and 
ecology-minded armchair travelers. Each video combines spectacular scenery with 
a detailed study of the animals found in parks along the Tanzania-Kenya border. 
</P>
<P>
The first tape opens with stunning views of the vast, 10,000-square-mile 
Serengeti Plain and a map showing the path of migration that the hundreds of 
thousands of zebra, wildebeest and gazelles make on their annual search for 
grasslands and water. According to the narration, it's an ecological cycle that 
has continued for 10 million years. 
</P>
<P>
The camera follows the trek and shows how the animals surmount the incredible 
hardships of their long journey, including the constant threat of predators -- 
hyenas, wild dogs and lions. 
</P>
<P>
You get contrasting, touching scenes of the family-oriented zebra grooming each 
other and the birth of a soon-doomed wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
The sound and sight of the thundering herd as it struggles across the swiftly 
flowing Mara River are a video highlight that Plimpton calls "one of the 
greatest wildlife spectacles on earth." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wood captures some poignant and amusing scenes of the six-ton elephants 
splashing and playing as they cool off in the mud holes of Amboseli National 
Park at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Elephant teen-agers are shown 
trunk-wrestling, and at an elephant family gathering, viewers watch seniors 
embracing each other as if greeting old friends. Other animals shown in the 
park include flamingoes, cape buffalo, wart hogs and ostriches. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a discussion between Plimpton and Russell Train, 
chairman of the World Wildlife Fund/The Conservation Foundation, on the threat 
from poachers to this one-great concentration of elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The second tape opens with film clips of an Osa and Martin Johnson safari of 
the 1920s, then concentrates on following the social structure and daily life 
of a pride of lions. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers follow the female as she stalks her prey, while the male spends his day 
lying around surveying his realm, and the cubs wrestle and explore. The pride 
survives in spite of the fact that, according to Plimpton, the female is a poor 
huntress, missing five out of six tries. There also are brief scenes of some of 
the other cats in the Masai Mara Game Reserve, including leopards and cheetahs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, producer Wood opens with early film from the movie "King Kong," 
comparing it with the gentle mountain gorillas found in the Virunga Mountains 
of Rwanda, where the late anthropologist Dian Fossey lived and died studying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The gorillas, which usually live at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, don't 
survive in captivity. Viewers will see the females flirting with the males, and 
the majestic silverback males protecting their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain gorillas are vegetarians, and scenes show them munching on the 
greenery and lolling in the sun, a favorite activity, while young ones stumble 
and frolic as they leave their mother to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Plimpton and Train conclude this segment with a discussion on preserving the 
mountain gorilla and the part that tourism plays in making the world aware of 
the nened for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are available from Eco Ventures, 2021 L. Street N.W., Suite 250, 
Washington, D.C. 20036. Call toll-free (800) 862-8900. Price: $29.95, or two 
for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Rica" (Megaview Productions International), 1988, 34 minutes. This is 
one of the few videos on Costa Rica, and it's remarkably good. For those who 
have been there, for those planning a trip or for those just curious, it's a 
worthwhile addition to a travel video collection. 
</P>
<P>
Against a montage of quick scenes showing some of the beauty and appeal of this 
Central American country -- lush green forests, rivers, volcanoes, gambling 
casinos and fishing -- the narrator gives viewers a bit of history as well as 
vital statistics on the high literacy rate, climate, number of bird species 
(850), national parks (26), which airlines fly there and an overview of the 
type of its hotels, facilities and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The major part of the video, however, takes viewers on a series of tours that 
cover the most popular tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
These include a tour of the capital, San Jose, showing scenes of the shopping 
district, central market place, national museum, national theater and 
restaurants. Side trips from San Jose include a visit to Sarchi and its ox-cart 
factory, where the colorful native souvenirs, as well as other crafts, are made 
and sold, and a visit to the enchanting Orosi Valley on the tumultuous 
Reventazon River for scenes of an exciting river rafting trip. This is followed 
by a tour to Tiquicia, "Tico" country, to a typical adobe farm-ranch restaurant 
to enjoy scenes of native food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Irazu volcano, topping 11,000 feet and from which you can see both the 
Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, is another tour destination, as is a visit to the 
rim of the awesome, still-active Poas volcano. At Cartago, at the foot of 
Irazu, viewers also see the Basilica de Los Angeles, where the La Negrita (the 
Black Virgin) statue is enshrined and to whom miracles have been attributed. 
</P>
<P>
A video highlight is the ride on the jungle train that connects Limon to San 
Jose, passing through coffee and banana plantations and small villages of the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
Other tours include a jungle adventure launch ride along the Colorado River and 
canals, with a stop at a lodge in the town of Colorado, and trips to the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest and the Carara Biological Reserve to view some of the 
many examples of the colorful and unusual plants, birds and animals being 
protected in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Nature lovers also will be rewarded with film and narration on the leatherback 
turtles seen laying their eggs on the beach. A final stop is at Lake Arenal, 
where fishermen are seen big-game fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the production was filmed in cooperation with the Swiss Travel 
Service, a tour company of Costa Rica, there are no blatant commercial plugs 
and no tie-ins with hotels or other tourist facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Megaview Productions, 255 N. El Cielo Road, Suite 155, 
Palm Springs, Calif. 92262, (619) 366-8464. Price: $25.

Later I got used to not caring a damn, just to walking and staying put when I 
had walked far enough, at some village of which I didn't know the name, to 
letting myself drift with Africa. -- Graham Greene, "Journey Without Maps" 
</P>
<P>
Drifting with the currents on Botswana's Okavango Delta, gliding through 
channels choked by papyrus and lily pads is like a journey without maps. 
</P>
<P>
I found myself in unfamiliar territory, not caring about anything but sitting 
back and enjoying the sky, the clouds and the birds as our canoe passed red and 
yellow reeds, swamp grasses, sausage trees and fields of maize. 
</P>
<P>
I watched wallowing hippos, heard the screech of baboons and, in the evening, 
fell asleep to a symphony of swamp sounds. I was not oblivious to the dangers 
of this watery wilderness, but it was hard to feel threatened in such pristine, 
even hypnotic, surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1923 there were no comprehensive maps of the Okavango Delta, a lush 
waterway on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. It's nearly impossible to 
accurately map an area that changes so dramatically with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Okavango River, which begins in the Angola Highlands, swells during the 
rainy season (November to April) and floods over a depression in Botswana, 
forming the world's largest inland delta: 6,500 square miles of inlets, flood 
plains, lagoons and islands. 
</P>
<P>
I went on a four-day water safari last May. It was a good time to visit. The 
Delta was in full flood, lush with vegetation, and the weather was dry and warm 
but never too hot. 
</P>
<P>
I saw lots of wildlife, though I probably would have seen more at the end of 
the dry season in September and October when herds of animals come to the Delta 
in search of water. 
</P>
<P>
Canoes, which are like water taxis, are the only way to get around much of the 
Delta. They transport people from village to village, to fishing or hunting 
areas. Polers are the taxi drivers, having grown up navigating the channels. 
They stand in the stern, moving the canoe forward with a long forked pole (a 
ngashi). 
</P>
<P>
 My journey began when two friends -- Katie Janssen and John Blank -- showed up 
at my door in Harare, Zimbabwe. They had just finished a year teaching in 
Kenyan villages. I was on a six-month trip to Harare, visiting a friend who 
works there. 
</P>
<P>
Katie and John were driving through eastern and southern Africa and suggested a 
trip to the Okavango -- the "Serengeti of Swamps" they called it. I was game. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to stick to a timetable when you're traveling in Africa in a '67 Land 
Rover. Every time we hit a rut I braced myself to avoid hitting my head on the 
roof. We stalled each time mud splashed on the spark plugs, which was often. 
</P>
<P>
It took three days to make the 700-mile trip to the Delta. We passed through 
customs behind a huge bus of Zimbabweans going to Botswana to shop. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Botswana soldiers stopped us at a roadblock. They were apparently making 
a routine check for South African secret agents who conduct undercover 
operations in Botswana, trying to find African National Congress guerrillas. 
They let us pass. 
</P>
<P>
After a long drive along the northern edge of the surprisingly lush Kalahari 
Desert it was a relief to see water. We had reached Maun, the gateway to the 
Delta. Maun is a patchwork of old and new, with posh hotels going up next to 
traditional villages. 
</P>
<P>
Herero women, refugees from Namibia, wander the streets dressed in colorful 
long dresses adopted from 19th-Century German colonists, but decorated with 
African patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Our home base was 7 1/2 miles north of Maun at Island Safari Lodge. We shared a 
campsite with several South Africans speaking Afrikaans. They tried to convince 
us that apartheid doesn't exist, and that they weren't such "bad guys." They 
regaled us with tales of traversing the African bush. 
</P>
<P>
But we were more interested in water and canoes than Afrikaner tales. So we 
decided to hire a canoe and poler for four days through Island Safaris, at the 
lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Potter, who operates the lodge with her husband Phil, recommends using 
Fiberglas canoes rather than the traditional mokoros, which are carved from 
sausage trees. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to chop down a sausage tree to make a mokoro," she said. "Before long 
the trees will be gone. Besides, you get a wet bum in a mokoro. I guarantee 
it." We were to get "wet bums" anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The next day a speedboat took us into the Delta. As we went deeper, the winding 
pathway through the lily pads grew narrower. The boatman moved expertly through 
the tortuous channels at breakneck speed. Every so often he would stop and 
reverse the motor, when the prop became clogged with reeds. 
</P>
<P>
After two hours we reached an island inhabited by polers who were sitting 
around a fire making coffee in tin cans and cooking mielie meal. Mielie meal, 
the staple food in sub-Saharan Africa, is like thick grits. It fills you up but 
won't put meat on your bones. A telltale sign: There wasn't an overweight man 
among the polers. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't pay much heed to us when we arrived. But eventually Kenneth Monare, 
a tall, barefoot man wearing shorts and a blue T-shirt, approached us. He would 
be our pilot and guide for the next four days. 
</P>
<P>
We were lucky. Kenneth spoke English and enjoyed practicing it with us. He also 
taught us a few Setswana phrases. Although English is the official language of 
Botswana, Setswana, a Bantu language of the Tswana tribe, is spoken by 90% of 
its population. 
</P>
<P>
Monare's friend Kid, a shorter man wearing a BMW jacket, piloted the other 
canoe in our party, which also included a Canadian couple who were traveling 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
When the polers were ready, we glided out into a channel bound for Chief's 
Island, the main island in Moremi Wildlife Reserve (set up by the Tswana tribe 
in 1962 to protect the animals) and one of the best game reserves in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth stood in the stern and began rhythmically poling us forward. The prow 
of the canoe parted the reeds that sprouted like stubble from the water. 
Sometimes a spider, while stretching a web between the reeds, would fall into 
our canoe. 
</P>
<P>
The spiders were fat, dark and fuzzy, though non-poisonous. We would either 
toss them out of the canoe or carry them along with us to another part of the 
Delta. The webs were often so beautiful that I felt sad, as if we had destroyed 
a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta is a palette of colors: yellow water lilies, white and pink flowers 
against the reeds, tiny green frogs on lily pads. 
</P>
<P>
When we passed another canoe Kenneth would greet his fellow poler with a hearty 
"dumela!" ("hello" in Setswana). I marveled at how he could navigate the delta 
maze in which channels become dead ends clogged by vegetation. Some of the 
channels are kept open only because hippos break through the reeds. 
</P>
<P>
We reached our first campsite on Chief's Island after three hours and a bit too 
much sun. Later, we took the canoe out to get water for cooking and to 
photograph the sunsets. The nights, what with the campfires and the stars, 
reminded me of my childhood camping trips. 
</P>
<P>
When we were quiet we were treated to a cacophony of exotic sounds: the screech 
of baboons . . . hippo grunts . . . the plaintive songs of crickets, frogs, 
birds . . . an insect that sounded like the tinkling of a toy piano, and the 
eerie cackling of hyenas. 
</P>
<P>
As we brushed our teeth we saw two yellow eyes of a bush baby, a nocturnal 
primate, staring at us through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of mosquitoes were considerably less exciting. I was glad that I was 
wearing mosquito repellent and taking anti-malaria medication. Malaria is the 
main hazard in the delta. It's unlikely that one would be bitten by tsetse 
flies, crocodiles, lions, leopards or poisonous snakes, but anyone who goes 
into the delta and doesn't take precautions against malaria is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning Kenneth took us to another spot on the northern part of Chief's 
Island, a place that abounds with game. We passed a deep pool where hippos were 
wallowing. Kenneth and Kid kept their distance. I was aware that an angry hippo 
could smash a canoe to bits. But Kenneth, with typical African tour guide 
aplomb, said there was little danger. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very frightened," he said, as a snort came up from a hippo. Nine times 
out of 10 he's right. Of course I'd hate to be too close on that occasion when 
a hippo does decide to charge. 
</P>
<P>
As we approached our destination Kenneth and Kid found that the channel had 
shifted and was only a few inches deep. The thick swamp grasses made it 
impossible to move forward. After a futile effort, Kenneth gave us the command: 
"Get out!" 
</P>
<P>
We rolled up our pants legs and began to push the canoes through the reeds. We 
splashed through the mushy swamp. Now, I'm not one who particularly enjoys 
sticking his feet into swamp water. I had visions of leeches covering my 
calves. I feared it might be time for the crocodiles to have a picnic. I guess 
I identify more with Woody Allen than Indiana Jones. 
</P>
<P>
We reached our campsite tired but exhilarated. I looked back at the area we had 
just crossed -- a field of tans and yellows fading into the blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the island was deserted except for the animals. We followed 
Kenneth on walking safaris. He led us for hours as he followed smells, tracks 
and droppings through the brown grass and gnarled trees. He had to quiet us 
several times to avoid frightening the animals. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, after hours of walking, he put up his hand to halt us. Several 
zebra, wildebeest, tsesebe antelope and warthogs came out in front of us, no 
more than 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
We were on the trail of an elephant. We could smell its musk-like odor but we 
never found it. I had seen elephants before, but always from the safety of a 
vehicle. I feared the possibility of coming face to face with one of the huge 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
But we probably were safe in Kenneth's hands. He had a keen sense of the smells 
and sounds of the delta -- where to go and, perhaps more important, where not 
to go. His calm and self-confidence was reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
On our last night I realized why Kenneth wanted Kid to come along. They joked 
and laughed together, making the trip relaxed and fun for all of us. But Kid 
was also a master fisherman. He took a drop line, crouched by the water's edge 
and snared 20 fish. 
</P>
<P>
Kid and Kenneth used four of the fish to make a stew for themselves, and saved 
the rest for their fellow polers. I feared that perhaps the fish would be the 
appetizer and we would be the main course for some predator -- a leopard, 
baboon or hyena, whose jaws are said to be the strongest of all animals. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, hyenas are known to attack humans while they sleep, which is why it's 
important to keep your tent flap zipped up. But in the morning the fish were 
still dangling on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth showed us his calloused hands, which told the story of his years as a 
poler. The lodge pays him 5 pula (about $2.50) a day plus food. (Passengers are 
expected to tip their poler at the end of the trip.) 
</P>
<P>
He told us that someday he would like to own his own mokoro. But you need to 
pay a teacher 200 to 300 pula to show you how to build one. Besides that, 
Kenneth had to think about saving enough pulas to someday pay for a bride. 
Payment to the parents of the bride used to be in cattle; now you can pay in 
pulas (or VCRs in some parts of Africa). 
</P>
<P>
I was happy I didn't have to worry about a bride's price. Then again, I would 
soon return to a complex world of jumbo jets and grid-locked cities, and 
somehow the life of the poler seemed more civilized and appealing. 
</P>
<P>
As we rode back to the Island Safari Lodge in a powerboat at what now seemed 
like a frenetic pace, I hoped that there would always be room in this world for 
the polers, expertly plying the uncharted delta waters.

<LEADPARA>  HARD-CORE news purists always have given CBS's "60 Minutes" gang a bad time
over the show's frequent "soft" interviews with show-business celebrities, but
now those show-biz interviews are beginning to look like solid gold.;   Case
in point: Tonight's two-hour CBS special, "60 Minutes: The Entertainers,"
culling some of the very best moments from all the show-biz interviews the
show has done over the past couple of decades. This is a terrifically
entertaining show, probably because the good parts of those interviews are so
good, and the bad parts were left behind in the archives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Among the memorable moments:;   (check) Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy
faking out a startled Mike Wallace by pretending they'd decided to separate
because, as Cronyn put it, "Jess has her eye on another fellow, and I'd like
to play the field while I'm still vertical.";   (check) Lena Horne, at 64,
telling Ed Bradley she still sings earthy songs because "you can't help your
sexual nature.";   (check) Opera immortal Beverly Sills comparing herself to
"a fairly decent plumber.";   (check) Paul Simon grieving over the breakup of
his marriage to Carrie Fisher and celebrating a long overdue rapport with his
father.;   (check) Jackie Gleason explaining Ralph Kramden's true character to
Morley Safer.;   As you might expect, veteran correspondent Wallace comes off
as the bete noir of the show, asking the rudest questions. We see him bullying
Vladimir Horowitz into playing "Stars and Stripes Forever" for the first time
in 20 years, accusing Johnny Carson of being an alcoholic, ridiculing Shirley
MacLaine for her New Age ideas ("You don't have to be that unpleasant," she
tells him. "It doesn't become you") and even asking Itzhak Perlman why so many
"world class fiddle players" are Jewish. ("Our fingers are circumcised,"
Perlman retorts.);   The result is a crackling two hours that will zip by
before you know it, leaving you with a hankering for more.; 'Beyond Reality';
The USA cable network is rapidly moving into more hours of original
programming. Unfortunately, not much of it is any better than "Beyond
Reality," an oddball hybrid that premieres tonight at 9. It falls somewhere
between a weekly mystery series and a "reality" show based on screwball cover
stories from the tabloids.;   Shari Belafonte and Carl Marotte play
parapsychologists who each week investigate a different case, which the
producers claim is based on "reported incidents." In the preview episode, they
check out one of Marotte's college students, an introverted dweeb who walks
through her looking glass like Alice and into a parallel dimension where she
isn't a dweeb. This incident may have been reported somewhere, but I don't
think it was in the New York Times.;   Let me be kind and just say I found
"Beyond Reality" profoundly stupid.; 'Servants of Twilight'; Author Dean R.
Koontz is the cut-rate Stephen King, another horror novelist with some
impressive sales figures, especially in the paperback line. His great weakness
is his familiar plots. That's pretty much the main thing wrong with tonight's
Koontz adaptation, "Servants of Twilight," on the Showtime pay-TV network.;  
Based on Koontz's "Twilight," the movie owes too much to "The Omen," with its
plot about religious fanatics trying to bump off a little boy they think is
the Anti-Christ. However, once you're past the first bumpy, flashback-choked
minutes, "Servants of Twilight" delivers plenty of thrills, even with the
stale plot.;   Bruce Greenwood plays the private detective trying to protect
unwed mother Belinda Bauer and her 6-year-old son (Jarrett Lennon) from the
evil followers of Mother Grace (Grace Zabriskie) and her Church of the
Twilight. Once he's on the case, we're in for a wild and violent chase that
leaves you quite breathless by the climactic struggle between good, evil, a
leftover giant from "Twin Peaks" and an attic full of bats.;   By no means is
"Servants of Twilight" a masterwork of the genre, but thrill-seekers could do
a lot worse than this fast-paced entertainment.; 'Zebras'; "Zebras: Patterns
in the Grass," Sunday night's edition of "National Geographic Explorer" on the
TBS cable network, is a fascinating saga of the annual 300-mile migration of
zebra herds in Botswana. Here's one overwhelmingly good reason to watch: There
were 45,000 zebras making the journey in 1981, but only 7,000 were left to try
this year.;   Narrator Brian Dennehy calls the trek a "gauntlet of death."
He's not kidding. We watch as lions, hyenas, wild dog packs and even hunters
ravage the herds as they head south to feed on fertile grasslands each year.; 
 Among the unusual sights captured by famed naturalists and film makers Dereck
and Beverly Joubert: mother zebras shielding their foals from other zebras so
the newborn progeny will learn to "home in" on only their mother's distinctive
pattern of stripes; stallions and "bachelor" zebras lining up to protect foals
from wild dogs; a female zebra's sire testing a male suitor's worthiness as a
mate by fighting with him; lions and hyenas dragging down an amazing 150 foals
in just 10 terror-filled days.;   This is another powerful film in this fine
series, reminding us of the majesty of the many species now in sharp decline
all over the world.; 'Played in the USA'; This Sunday cable's The Learning
Channel (TLC) starts a new 13-week series called "Played in the USA," which
chronicles the diversity of music performed in America through the works of
independent film and video producers. The kickoff event is extra special: a
documentary on the recording of Broadway's "Company" soundtrack album, which
has been kept from public view for 20 years by a legal hassle.;   Filmed by
the acclaimed D.A. Pennebaker and Richard Leacock ("Monterey Pop," "Don't Look
Back"), the cinema verite documentary of a marathon 18-hour recording session
was tied up over music copyrights until recently settled.;   Not only does the
film show us how they record a Broadway score, but it also gives us intriguing
behind-the-scenes glimpses of composer Stephen Sondheim, legendary
producer-director Harold Prince and others at work with the show's stars,
Elaine Stritch, Dean Jones and Barbara Barrie.;   A special bonus: Look for a
rare, early sequence featuring Charles Kimbrough, now best known as anchorman
Jim Dial in "Murphy Brown."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   An elephant with a habit of breaking
his cages and wearing out his welcome at a series of zoos has moved
into a home for the unwanted.
   Sonny is settling in at the Popcorn Park Zoo, 35 miles north of
Atlantic City, zoo director John Bergmann said Sunday. The three-ton
African elephant arrived Friday after a four-day cross-country trip
by truck.
   ``He investigated everything the first night he was here, testing
everything and seeing if he could push it down,'' Bergmann said.
``After he realized what he was in, we haven't had any problem.''
   The $300,000 stall is a 160-foot-square paddock with a pool and a
concrete column with a chain to attach toys like tree trunks or
empty beer kegs.
   The 11-year-old elephant's former owner, the Hillcrest Park Zoo
in Clovis, N.M., gave him up because he was too big and unruly. He
kept pulling his cage apart and once knocked down an electrified
wire designed to prevent his escape.
   Sonny has been passed from zoo to zoo, Bergmann said. The
elephant also has an unattractive scar on his trunk from his days in
the wild.
   ``He's not mean and nasty by any means,'' Bergmann said. ``He
just hasn't been trained to be handled and be taken care of.''
   The zoo, run by the Associated Humane Societies, takes in wild
and domestic animals that can't survive on their own or whose owners
no longer want them. Its residents include a tiger, two lions, four
black bears, a cougar and a hyena.

AMBOSELI NATIONAL PARK, Kenya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't be sure how many were out there. They had just shaken me from a deep 
sleep, a herd of cavorting hippopotamuses bellowing like out-of-tune tubas as 
they blundered and splashed in the dark waters a hundred feet from my tent. 
</P>
<P>
No one had said anything about camping with hippos, I thought as I listened to 
their midnight mirth on the shore of Lake Baringo. I lay awake most of the 
night, tracking their sounds through my canvas tent and waiting to sidle into 
the darkness to the distant latrine. But even when the revelry subsided and the 
camp seemed calm, the snorts and grunts of a lone hippo grazing between the 
tents kept me stranded inside. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finally left the tent, the African sun was burning through the 
dawn clouds. The hippos were back in the lake resting, only their heads poked 
through the water, brown bumps peeping at the shore. We eight campers peered 
back, shaking our heads in awe and amusement at our obnoxious neighbors. I 
walked toward the lake to get a closer look. Two hippos yawned, showing 
cavernous, pink mouths. Others paddled closer, then circled out in single file 
and disappeared into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Camping," a friend said as we walked back to our tents, "is the only way to 
see Africa." 
</P>
<P>
That's the sentiment that convinced me to go camping for the first time. Until 
then, my idea of roughing it had been staying at a motel without an ice 
machine. But as our group reached the halfway point on a two-week camping 
safari through Kenya's most popular lakes and game parks in the summer of last 
year, I couldn't imagine better accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are more comfortable ways to go on safari. One can see 
elephants grazing or lions playing in the high grass as easily from a lodge as 
from a campsite. But to fully experience the world beyond a minibus window, 
camping is authentically best. The sound of a hyena prowling outside your tent 
wraps you in the romance and reality of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The snow-covered peak of Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro loomed through a sheath of 
clouds like a celestial being. On the blazing plain below, a bearded wildebeest 
scampered before a dozen grazing zebras, darting and leaping in a lunatic 
dance. A jackal ran ahead of the bus, then dived into the brush. A small herd 
of elephants grazed near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
We had just arrived in Amboseli National Park after a four-hour trek on the 
dusty, pockmarked roads from Nairobi. Our guide, Joseph, sat amused in the 
driver's seat, politely jerking the minibus to a stop with each oohhh and aahhh 
from behind. "We will get much closer to the animals," he said. "Are you sure?" 
someone asked. "Yes, yes. I am sure. Trust me," he said, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
A 30ish member of the Kikuyu tribe with extensive knowledge of the game parks, 
Joseph not only tracked animals but maneuvered the minibus to within a few feet 
of fighting elephants and feeding lions. Amboseli, one of Kenya's smallest game 
parks, is famous for its herds of wildebeests, Burchell's zebras, water 
buffaloes, gazelles and a handful of the endangered rhinoceroses, but it's the 
elephants that seize the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the elephants have been heavily poached for their ivory during the 
last decade, the gray giants seemed to be everywhere in Amboseli. They grazed 
in herds numbering from a few individuals to a few hundred, always with 
sentries posted for their only predator, man. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside our minibus, a calf tried to filch a bunch of grass that another calf 
had shaken free of dirt. A bull inexplicably dropped to its front knees and 
kicked its hind legs like a circus performer. Two juveniles squared off in 
play, their trunks entwined, one driving the other like a sumo wrestler into 
our shadow. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk we drove to our campsite, marked by a stone in a cluster of thorn trees 
surrounded by the the dusty plain. 
</P>
<P>
This is the no-frills camp. Those wishing more pampered treatment can choose 
from several luxury tour operators who offer campsites with permanent tents and 
private baths, meals served on fine china and good wines. But we were 
comfortable enough in our rickety abodes, sleeping in bags on thin foam 
mattresses and dining on staples -- lots of bread, cheese and fresh fruit. The 
cost was about $1,200 each. 
</P>
<P>
Our first night in the bush was cool and quiet; it surprised me. I expected the 
night to be more menacing and claustrophobic. The cook managed a good meal of 
pasta, potatoes and beans on a fire that brought our group together under the 
sparkling canopy of the Southern Hemisphere. Over drinks, we traded stories of 
travels and careers, and drifted into the darkness to our tents. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few days our routine was to drive in the morning to view 
wildlife and return in the heat of the day to camp, some to sit at the shaded 
table to read or write letters, while others washed clothes or napped. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon I followed the sounds of laughter from my tent to the edge of 
camp, where three young Masai herdsmen leaned against a minibus, talking with a 
few of our group. They wore traditional red cloth, tied like a toga over their 
lanky frames. Elaborate red and yellow earrings dangled from their spool-sized 
lobes. Their hair, braided and matted with red ocher and fat, stained the backs 
of their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of them let us examine his weapons. He appeared to be in his 20s, 
but no one was sure -- years are not counted by the Masai. We touched the sword 
and spear he used to protect his cattle from predators. The Masai protect their 
herds fiercely, for not only do they measure their worth in cattle, they live 
on milk and blood drawn from living cows. 
</P>
<P>
We spent two more hours together. They were intrigued by our jewelry, cameras 
and sunglasses. Then they returned to the bush to watch their cattle graze 
under the high sun. We went back to writing and reading about the people of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in Amboseli, we headed north through the lush forests and 
grasslands of Mt. Kenya, then out on the plains to the Samburu Game Reserve. We 
set up camp on the sandy banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro, a muddy oasis amid a 
parched landscape of desert scrub and savanna that's home to a range of 
wildlife. It's one of the few places in Kenya to see the reticulated giraffe 
and the Grevey's zebra, together with Marabou storks, gazelles, dik-dik and 
gerenuk (varieties of antelope), and, of course, vultures. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu brought home the usual risks of camping: a snake near the latrine, 
warnings of scorpions and of crocodiles. An unusual risk, too: "There has been 
some trouble with Sudanese refugees," our guide said as he explained why two 
guards armed with machine guns had been hired to patrol the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Sudan was 300 miles from our camp, an unlikely source of danger. Only after our 
return to the United States did the reason become clear: In July, 1989, 
poachers and bandits were believed to have slain five tourists, including a 
Connecticut woman, in the game parks. Since then the Kenyan government has 
stepped up patrols and instituted a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. The 
U.S. State Department currently says security has "improved markedly" but 
cautions against solo camping. 
</P>
<P>
We moved west from Samburu to Lake Baringo in Kenya's lake region in the scar 
of the Rift Valley. The rough roads carried us slowly through the late-morning 
bustle of small villages. A man, twirling a blade of grass in his teeth, walked 
his bicycle past a woman balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. Outside 
the villages, herdsmen pushed their goats and cows through the valley fields. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous of the Rift Valley lakes is Lake Nakuru, where, in one of the 
world's greatest bird spectacles, 2 million flamingos gather in alkaline waters 
to feast on its algae. 
</P>
<P>
One sees a bustle of pink and white as the birds skittishly preen, feed, honk 
and flap. Their spindly necks and legs belie the gracefulness they reach in the 
air, black-spotted wings and outstretched bodies in effortless flight which 
concludes with a running splash in the shallow waters. 
</P>
<P>
The national park at Lake Nakuru pales in comparison with the others; we saw 
only a few water bucks and oryxes there. But, as with the hippos at Lake 
Baringo, the best wildlife encounters took place at the campsite. As we set up 
camp under the tall acacias, water bucks grazed in the lush green grass, dozens 
of Vervet monkeys skittered about and a handful of baboons retreated to the 
bushes behind our tents. 
</P>
<P>
At night a group of bush pigs crashed through the food tent, bumbling in the 
dark through the cans and pots. The cook screamed to scare them off, and a few 
of us laughed as he muttered about his sleepless night. 
</P>
<P>
We left the Rift Valley -- and the only campsites with showers and toilets -- 
for three days in Masai Mara, the largest and last game park on our safari. The 
Masai Mara Game Reserve ranges over 974 square miles that adjoin the Serengeti 
Plain of Tanzania and is famous for the more than 1 million wildebeests and 
thousands of zebras, gazelles and antelopes that migrate there once a year. 
</P>
<P>
We found instead a smattering of gazelles, giraffes, topi and anxious predators 
amid an Edenic landscape of grassy plains and acacia trees. 
</P>
<P>
A male lion, his ribs showing through an emaciated body, moved slowly along the 
plain. The wind rustled his black mane. Behind him, in the golden camouflage of 
the savanna, three lionesses licked and nuzzled their cubs as they grappled for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, five giraffes marched in a row, heads bobbing in unison. Shafts 
of light broke through a low cumulus canopy onto hundreds of Thomsen's gazelles 
as they grazed. 
</P>
<P>
These and other images that unfolded during the next three days enraptured me 
as we crisscrossed the vast Masai Mara. Even the driving rainstorm that 
shortened our last game drive and toppled my tent left me secured by this 
noble, pristine landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It was our last night on safari. The rain had soaked my tent and sleeping bag 
and left me only a small spot to sit on. I waited for the storm to end, 
remembering a conversation I had with a Kikuyu merchant at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you like our country?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite beautiful," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but it is only beautiful to the foreigner," he said. "To us it's only 
very poor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the realities of Kenya -- the potholes of its capital, the poaching of 
its wildlife -- belie much of the land's romance. Some of us carried Karen 
Blixen books and other adventure stories to help us imagine a world long gone. 
</P>
<P>
But as we drove through Masai Mara for the final time, a shared, primeval 
heritage still seemed to beat on these vast plains. It was quiet and empty and 
I watched the bus tracks dissolve in the grass. I wished to see a giraffe or 
gazelle for the last time, but there was nothing, only a solitary, crooked 
acacia twitching in the wind.

There is an old movie adage that when all else fails - or when all else has
succeeded but you need a fresh gimmick - you should send your characters
into the desert.
There you will find eye-catching scenery, limitless horizons and a licence
to conjure mirages. Many people at Cannes this year thought The Adventures
Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert was a mirage. A comedy of cross-dressing
from macho Australia? And a funny one?
It fast became the hit of the festival. It revives Terence Stamp's career at
a stroke - he plays one of three drag queens whose hired bus breaks down in
the Outback, causing many an unexpected encounter and adventure - and
provides the wittiest, most off-the-wall gay movie since La Cage Aux Folles.
Priscilla opens this Friday. Disney's The Lion King opened last Friday and
is already swallowing large audiences whole. This desert is African and the
most spectacular cartoon landscape of modern times. Thrill to the stampeding
wildebeest. Gasp at the burning plains patrolled by lions and hyenas. And
relish Jeremy Irons' suave turn as the wicked lion uncle, obviously reared
on old George Sanders films when he was a cub.
Zhang Yimou's To Live, from the director of Red Sorghum and Ju Dou, is
another of China's revisionist epics about Chinese history: 30 years in the
war-ravaged, Mao-harrassed
life of a puppeteer and his
wife. But Zhang's vision is fiercer and harsher than Chen Kaige's
in the recent Farewell My Concubine, and the battle confrontations in the
desert are unforgettable.
Finally, wrap up your desert research with Walter Hill's Geronimo, filmed in
scenic Utah, a few leagues north of the Indian chief's real stomping grounds
in Arizona/New Mexico. In other respects the movie, opening this week,
claims exhaustive historical authenticity and has Gene Hackman and Robert
Duvall in the supporting cast.

   War and famine have turned Sudan, Africa's
largest nation, into a vast morgue. Besides the dead there are the
uprooted, seeking food where there is none. Here is a report on the
situation.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hyenas crept into the town at night,
dragged away emaciated corpses and devoured them in the bush. The
starving residents who remained alive were too weak to bury the
dead.
   About 3,000 people have died of starvation since July at the
town called Abyei in southwestern Sudan, an area of despair
afflicted by civil war and famine.
   Abyei's dead are among at least 250,000 people who foreign
relief officials say have died this year of starvation or
inadequate medical care. Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi claims the
estimate is 20 times the actual figure.
   Abyei was unknown to the world until the United States announced
a $1 million program this month to fly 90 tons of grain over a
10-day period to the town 500 miles southwest of Khartoum.
   Drought and five years of civil war have made famine endemic to
three Sudanese provinces south of Abyei.
   U.S. officials decided on the relief program because of reports
of mass starvation in the town, which had been overrun by thousands
driven from their homes by the war.
   The U.N. Children's Fund joined in with special high-protein
food for children. UNICEF officials say the relief programs saved
5,000 children from certain death.
   Videotape brought from the town last week showed children with
heads too large for their shrunken bodies. Many had the sunken eyes
and dull orange hair of extreme malnutrition.
   Cole Dodge, a UNICEF representative, told reporters after
returning from Abyei: ``Even an intensive care unit in New York
would find it hard to save these kids, some are so far gone.''
   Western and Sudanese relief officials said 2 million southerners
have been turned into refugees by fighting between government
soldiers and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. They say
about 1.3 million of those were forced from their homes this year.
   Some set out on foot for northern Sudan, others for Ethiopia to
the east. Many died on the way. Those who made it to other parts of
Sudan found little food.
   Relief workers who flew to Abyei with the airlift gave this
description:
   Grass and shrubs cover the narrow airstrip because of the
heaviest summer rains since 1946, which turned Abyei into a virtual
island and trapped 30,000-40,000 people with only enough food for
15,000.
   Most were old men, women and children because strong men were
fighting in the civil war.
   Refugees arrived in Abyei with accounts of trudging through
swampland for weeks, eating leaves and being attacked by rebel
bands who took what little food and clothing the victims had.
   Some Western relief workers say the rebels are trying to make
people move north, creating problems for the government in
Khartoum. The rebels seek greater autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated north for southern Sudan, most of whose people are
Christian or animist.
   The first U.S.-chartered planes arrived Oct. 13 in Abyei, which
consists of 12-15 permanent structures and thousands of huts built
of sticks and grass.
   Feeble-looking men came to the twin-engine Cessna in ragged
shorts and tattered remnants of flowing robes.
   Relief officials say the 90 tons of supplies and the UNICEF food
for children should last until the rainy season ends in about two
weeks and trucks can reach Abyei again. But they fear about 50,000
more refugees also may arrive then.
   Families get weekly allotments of grain. The Red Crescent, the
Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, handles distribution.
   Videotapes from Abyei show children aged 4-10 crowding the
UNICEF feeding quarters with bowls to receive a porridge-like food
called Unimix from huge containers.
   The children are fed three times a day. They sit in the dusty,
walled-in yard under shades of grass and bamboo, some smiling and
chatting, others slowly eating from wooden or plastic bowls,
scraping up every remaining bit with their fingers.
   UNICEF officials believe many children died on the way to Abyei
or before the food came. They said the number of adults at Abyei
should have many more children than the 5,000 in the town.
   ``People are just completely emaciated. It was a situation of
absolute destitution,'' Dodge said.
   UNICEF officials say the summer estimate of 80 deaths a day in
Abyei was reduced to 10 daily this month. They say the rate appears
even lower in the latter part of October.
   No clear picture is available of the situation in the war-torn
regions of Bahr el-Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile.
   Relief officials and reporters cannot get into many parts of the
war zone, where the rebels control about 90 percent of the
countryside.

A British tourist whose charred bones were found in a game park was murdered, a 
court ruled today, vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state 
investigators who claimed that wild animals had killed her. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Julie Ward remains unsolved, however, with no one arrested and the 
judge's saying he saw no need for further investigation. Ward's father has 
charged that there was an official cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative 
tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were found Sept. 13, 1988, 
in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve, a week after she reportedly left the 
world-renowned park while on a wildlife photography expedition. 
</P>
<P>
The state claimed that the 28-year-old woman was eaten by carnivores after 
abandoning her vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home to lions, vultures, 
hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England, contended that she was 
murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He pleaded with the state to 
order an inquest and spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours 
in a private investigation of her death. 
</P>
<P>
"There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died of foul play by a 
person or persons unknown," Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango said at the 
conclusion of his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the state's contention that Ward had been killed by animals, Mango 
said: "I think the animals are innocent. If they are guilty at all, it is in 
eating what they found."

<TEXT>
   Foster father Viv Wilson is fond of
his orphans even if they do growl and grunt, snarl and snap, hiss
and hoot.
   One even bit off a finger.
   The 58-year-old former game ranger's charges are lions, hyenas,
baboons, crocodiles, snakes and hundreds of birds common to the
African bush.
   ``It's not a zoo, and it's not for financial gain,'' said
Wilson, a native South African who set up the home in 1973.
   ``It's simply a private sanctuary for orphaned, abandoned,
confiscated or injured wild animals that, reared in captivity,
can't safely be returned to the wilds.''
   Chipangali Wildlife Orphanage realizes a dream Wilson had
nurtured since working as a game ranger for the British colonial
government in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia.
   The body of a newborn kudu calf, clubbed to death by a native
hunter who also shot its mother, begot Wilson's ambition.
   He and the hunter met in the brush-studded Chipangali region of
eastern Zambia, heavily infested by trypanosomiasis - a disease
borne by tsetse files that can be fatal to man and beast.
   Wilson recalled asking the hunter why he killed the calf. The
hunter replied he was only doing his job, killing animals of some
species as part of the government's anti-tsetse fly operation.
   ``I knew he was right,'' said Wilson. ``But I also thought
something was awfully wrong.''
   When Zambia achieved independence in 1964, Wilson moved to
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where he was offered a good job in its game
department.
   Nine years later, Wilson founded Chipangali, 15 mies south of
Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, with savings and sponsorships.
   For Wilson, his wife Paddy and their two sons, home was a small
thatched roof house and work was tending a few animals in a cluster
of pens.
   This was the beginning of the seven-year war waged by guerrillas
against white supremacy. It ended in 1980 with independence under
President Robert Mugabe.
   ``We weren't touched by the war, and if guerrillas were roaming
around here, I never saw them,'' said Wilson. ``But we did get
quite a few soldiers popping in to drop off pets, mainly monkeys,
they'd tired of.''
   People continue to deliver animals to Wilson's care. Today,
Chipangali is a honeycomb of more than 70 large enclosures and
aviaries for ``The Orphans of the Wild,'' the title of a book by
Wilson published in 1977.
   A labyrinth of pebbled paths bordered by gardens of native
trees, plants and cactuses lead visitors to Wilson's waifs.
   ``We've strived to make the setting as naturally African as we
can, both for the animals and for people who come to see them,''
Wilson said.
   His family still lives beneath the thatch-roofed house flanked
by enclosures for lions, leopards and monkeys.
   About 20,000 people stroll around Chipangali's 10 acres each
year, a third of them schoolchildren who are allowed to visit free
of charge. Adults pay the equivalent of $2.
   ``We encourage the kids,'' said Wilson, who serves as manager
for a trust fund set up to bankroll the orphanage. ``Africans
brought up in the rural areas fully understand wildlife because
it's all around them. ... But millions of Africans born in cities
and towns have never seen a lion, a leopard or a snake.''
   Urban children, he said, ``have lost contact with nature. Here,
we take them back to the wild.''
   The $10,000 needed monthly for Chipangali's upkeep comes from
gate receipts, sales of a wildlife calendar, the orphanage's
restaurant and fund-raising events such as horseracing.
   Scores of sponsors, many of them foreigners, adopt animals and
send checks as foster parents.
   ``We still battle,'' said Wilson, who launched Chipangali on
$400 a month. ``We can never close, so we must cut our cloth to
suit our income.''
   Wilson, who as a game ranger survived charges by rhinoceros and
bites from poisonous snakes, has had few problems from his
creatures.
   A lion chomped off one of his fingers, a visiting schoolboy was
slightly injured by a leopard and some of his 40 employees have
been bitten by monkeys.
   Besides running the orphanage, Wilson has authored three
wildlife books, helped produce a 25-episode program for television
and written some 60 research papers on African snakes, animals and
birds.
   He was commissioned by the Geneva-based International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources to study ways to
prevent the extinction of the jentink's duiker antelope of Liberia,
and won the 1987 Rolex Spirit of Enterprise award for his work
there.
   In June, he was among 500 people worldwide honored by the United
Nations for environmental achievements.
   Wilson left Liberia in March just before the outbreak of civil
war. He fears the few surviving duiker were destroyed in the
conflict.
   ``That's my next concern,' ' he said. ``As soon as things are
settled down I'll go back to see for myself.''

turn to mud in the southern African dry season. They siphon water with their
great trunks, trumpeting angrily whenever the occasional train roars past on
Hwange's border.;    Chris Van Wyk, a strapping Afrikaner, likes to think of

<TEXT>     Tonight, as we emerged from the acacia forest in Van Wyk's Toyota Land
Rover, he gestured sharply to his right: A herd of 50 elephants rumbled away
in fright, kicking up clouds of white Kalahari desert sand. But one old bull
lingered in a water hole 50 yards from us, oblivious to our intrusion. Van Wyk
descended from the vehicle, scattered sand, then, satisfied that we were
downwind of the keen-smelling, nearsighted beast, silently motioned me forward
until we were just a few long strides away.;    Suddenly, he froze -- we'd
moved a little too close. The bull had emerged from the pan and was plodding
straight at us, raising his mud-covered tusks. Van Wyk began running backward,
slapping a cartridge into his Winchester and locking the bolt. Distracted or
confused, the elephant turned away.;    Hwange National Park sits on the high
semidesert plains in the northwest corner of Zimbabwe, formerly called
Rhodesia after British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. This arid "safari belt" was
once the country's war zone. My visit during the African winter last August
came 10 years after black Patriotic Front guerrillas, led by Joshua Nkomo and
Robert Mugabe, triumphed in their struggle to topple the white-minority regime
and created the new nation of Zimbabwe.;    The Rhodesian war, which lasted
from 1972 to 1980, killed more than 15,000 people in sporadic bush clashes and
raids on army bases and white homesteads. Within a few months of independence,
150,000 of Rhodesia's white population of 250,000 had fled, many resettling in
South Africa. There they could continue the life of privilege that had
disappeared from the rest of the continent.;    Today a traveler in Zimbabwe
has the sense of a nation finally at peace. Some of the 100,000 white
"Rhodies" who remain are prospering like Van Wyk, by running safaris in the
very bush where they spent the civil war. Blacks, who comprise 99 percent of
the 9.5 million people and who were held back under the white-minority regime,
now dominate the civil service in Zimbabwe's cities and, in the bush, are
making slow inroads in the tourist business.;    The apartheid that blights
South Africa has become an odious memory here -- although many Rhodies' sense
of racial superiority has hardly dimmed with black independence.;    Zimbabwe
does resemble South Africa in one respect -- its efforts to protect its
resources. The 14,000-square-mile Hwange has 18,000 elephants, among the
greatest herds in Africa, and the Zambezi Valley is the last sanctuary of the
endangered black rhino. Because of the Civil War, tourism has been slow to
develop in Zimbabwe, and concessions that dole out huge chunks of wilderness
to a single safari operator, like Van Wyk, aren't unusual. That has kept
Zimbabwe from becoming marred by the crowds and the commercialization of
Kenya, which most Americans think of when they consider an African safari.;   
Indeed, Zimbabwe, along with neighboring Botswana, has a reputation among
wildlife connoisseurs for the most unspoiled game viewing on the continent.
Zimbabwe also has one of Africa's better developed infrastructures, from the
capital Harare to the tiny settlement of Kariba, gateway to the Zambezi
Valley. One of Africa's more prosperous countries (although plagued by
drought, unemployment and AIDS), for many Americans it remains a hazy place, a
Third World "hot spot" that still evokes images of land mines and AK-47-toting
guerrillas. During my two-week journey, I saw groups of British and South
African tourists -- but not a single American.;    My travels through Zimbabwe
took me to several other places that echo Hwange's magnificent isolation and
bountiful wildlife. Along the Zambezi River, I paddled through gorges and
Everglades-like shallows, slept on sand banks and, except for my canoeing
group, didn't encounter another human for days. At Matusadona National Park on
the shores of Lake Kariba, I stayed in a houseboat moored in a shallow bay
amid thousands of drowned trees -- and tracked lions in a hardscrabble land of
mopani trees, red-clay termite mounds and towering ilala-nut palms.;    Alone
at the falls;    Even Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe's prime tourist attraction,
feels virtually undiscovered. In the early morning, I reached the
300-foot-high falls via a dirt path through the rain forest. I paid one
Zimbabwean dollar (40 cents) to a sleepy clerk, and then walked along a muddy
precipice in solitude before the misting, mile-wide cascade.;    But nowhere
is Zimbabwe's wildness, openness and isolation better experienced than at a
camp such as Van Wyk's, a handful of tents down a gravel track in the
southeast corner of Hwange Park.;    A half-dozen luxury tents -- each
equipped with a cot, kerosene stove, night table and folding chair -- were
pitched beneath leadwood and ebony trees, lush green canopies that offered
protection from Hwange's easterly winds. Van Wyk and his Ndebele workers were
moving the camp from one clearing to another 500 yards away, digging latrines,
laying pipe from a well and erecting thatched canopies to shelter the tents. I
was his only guest during the transition period.;    Van Wyk spent three days
driving me in his Land Rover through the acacia forests, sand flats, palm
groves and open savannah of Hwange. Frequently we descended from the vehicle
and tracked the reserve's bountiful game -- giraffe, wildebeest, mongoose,
sable, zebra, ostrich, elephant, white rhino, bush buck -- on foot. We saw no
other tourists, no other vehicles.;    Each evening we returned to camp,
where, under a huge tarp, servants and cooks from the local Ndebele tribe
prepared four-course dinners by kerosene lamp in wood-burning stoves. Herds of
wildebeest -- prehistoric-looking bison with dust-mop bodies, spindly legs and
small brains -- gathered just a few yards from the tent camp. As we ate, the
night echoed with the unearthly shouts of hyenas, jackals and baboons. "Where
the tall grass ends and the short grass begins," said Van Wyk, pointing to the
spectral figures, "that's the end of human territory.";    Talk often shifted
from the animals to human concerns. Chain-smoking Berkeley cigarettes and
sipping a rum and Coke as we sat around a campfire, Van Wyk liked to discuss
his life as a "Rhodie" bushman in the Zimbabwe of President Mugabe. Actually,
he said, he'd considered emigrating to his native South Africa when the new
government came to power. "I didn't have faith in the blacks running the
country," he admitted.;    For now Van Wyk can pretend that his little corner
of Africa hasn't changed. He still sees himself as the benevolent baas,
looking after his black employees.;    But sometimes his attitude betrayed its
South African roots. He talked about his staff's "limitations," and once, as
we watched an elephant raise a leg and scratch beneath it with its trunk, he
commented: "That's just the way the blacks do it." Van Wyk laughed heartily,
while I, not wanting to antagonize my host, managed only a grimace at his
bigotry.;    If Van Wyk represents the old Rhodesian way of life and thought,
Jeremiah Gaza symbolizes the new Zimbabwe. I met the 28-year-old Shona
tribesman on the Zambezi River, the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, and
the fourth-longest river on the continent.;    Gaza loved the river. He had
grown up in Kariba and landed a job as a driver for a safari company nine
years ago, towing canoes from Kariba over the Zambezi Escarpment to Mana Pools
75 miles away. In 1989 he became one of the first blacks to be admitted into
an apprentice program for river guides -- a sign of changing attitudes among
the white-owned companies that dominate Zimbabwe's tourist trade.;    Illegal
rhino hunting;    Gaza became impassioned about the illegal rhino hunting that
flourishes here. Zambian poachers carrying AK-47s sneak across by night in
pursuit of the endangered black rhino, several thousand of which live in Mana
Pools park. The horn sells for $50,000 a kilogram on the black market. To
combat the poaching, well-trained squadrons of Zimbabwean rangers patrol the
bush and the river. Since 1984, 125 poachers have been shot to death and 55
captured, while three rangers and 675 rhino have been killed. "I can say the
Zambians are very poor," Gaza said. "They have ruined their country -- and now
they want to ruin Zimbabwe.";    A handsome man wearing an olive-green safari
hat, T-shirt, shorts and sandals, Gaza led us through the bayou-like shallows,
so different from the chasms of white water that characterize the Zambezi
further upstream, near Victoria Falls. The fierce African sun rose over the
empty green hills of Zambia as animals came down to the river to drink.;   
Elephants waded deliberately across the river -- gentlemanly beasts who paid
no attention as we watched them while sticking our paddles in the muck to stop
our drift downstream. The banks teemed with baboons, crocodiles, waterbuck,
Cape buffalo, black samango monkeys, buffalo and exotic birds ranging from
fish eagles to Goliath herons to lilac-breasted rollers.;    But the dominant
animal on the Zambezi is the hippo. "I can say . . . there may be 1,500 hippo
between Mana Pools and Kanyemba," said Gaza. He was constantly offering
tidbits about the river, prefacing every fact with the expression, "I can
say.";    By the third day on the Zambezi, the current quickened as it passed
through the Mupata Gorge, a dramatic landscape of velvety hills rising right
above the river. Thick clumps of weeds twisted around our paddles as the
current carried us swiftly downstream. Gaza gestured to the Zambian riverbank.
"Look, look!" he cried. It was a cheetah, moving silently through the low
grass. "He must be hunting for baboon," he said.;    One afternoon, he noticed
what appeared to be a bulky gray boulder lying on the bank and led us toward
it. As the boats scraped the river bottom and stopped against the beach, the
"boulder" suddenly quivered and rose haltingly to its feet. A 2,000-pound
hippo bull snorted menacingly. Then, instead of charging, it stood shivering.
The beast turned away from the canoe and plodded into the river, disappearing
beneath the brown-green surface.;    "He is sick," Gaza said. "He shakes and
his eyes are red, just like the last time I had malaria. I can say that he
will die very soon. Much death along the river.";    Some last words;  I
thought about his words days later, as I returned to Kariba from three days of
isolation on a houseboat moored on the lake shore. A Rhodie from Gaza's
company, Buffalo Safaris, met me with shocking news: Gaza had died in a Land
Rover accident a mile from the airstrip at Kanyemba where I'd last seen him.
He had been driving too fast on a rough dirt road, swerved to avoid a National
Parks truck and flipped the vehicle, killing himself instantly and injuring a
co-worker.;    It was hard to accept. He was a man who'd seemed to have found
his place in Zimbabwe, thriving in a land that, only 10 years ago, had been a
killing zone.;    Yet Jeremiah Gaza's sudden death seemed symbolic of both
Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa: racing toward the future, charged with
ambition, borne back by its own poverty, recklessness and fragility. In
Zimbabwe, the land's splendors are never far removed from their dangers.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Texan Sets up Zoo for Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA FENN HEINTZEN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clad in traditional Arabian robes
and headdress, Dr. Lawrence Curtis sits in his study, surrounded by
the things he loves _ an extensive zoological library, three snakes
and a scorpion that paces in a small box.
   Every so often, a curious ostrich peers through the window.
   Home for Curtis is Riyadh's zoo.
   The 58-year-old Texan was hired specially to establish a zoo in
this oil-rich nation and sometime in the future, he said, ``Saudi
Arabia may be breeding more endangered species than many advanced
countries.''
   Curtis spent 15 years as a zoo director in Fort Worth, Texas,
and another 15 in Oklahoma City.
   ``I was bored with conventional zoos,'' he said, and 18 months
ago heard that Riyadh was planning to open a zoo and needed a
director. He packed enough clothes for two weeks and headed for the
Saudi capital.
   He was hired on the spot and given just four months to prepare
for the zoo's opening in March 1987.
   Today, the Riyadh zoo is home to 1,200 animals, many of them
endangered species. It is also an oasis, carpeted in lush grass and
filled with flower beds, bubbling man-made streams, small trees,
and flowering vines thriving in the highly irrigated desert soil.
   Nearly 7,000 visitors a day pass through its gates _ men on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and veiled women on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Sundays, in accordance with Saudi Arabia's Islamic
tradition of separating the sexes.
   To Riyadh's residents, the zoo is a welcome change of scenery.
To Curtis, the zoo is much more.
   ``I really wanted our zoo to have an international reputation
for conservation,'' he said.
   One of his first tasks was to help persuade the municipality to
issue a policy statement supporting the Convention of International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a treaty designed to protect
wild animals in their native countries.
   Saudi Arabia supports the treaty although it has yet to sign it
_ a point Curtis thinks will change soon _ but the expression of
support made it easy for him to get colleagues all over the world
to help stock the zoo.
   In keeping with CITES guidelines, no endangered species were
collected from the wild.
   An Arabian leopard and an ibex were shipped from Cincinnati's
zoo. Pigmy hippos came from the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Boston
sent antelopes. Miami, Cleveland and Duke University sent lemurs.
San Diego contributed a scimiter horned oryx, and a golden lion
marmoset came from Washington, D.C.
   The zoo in Cairo, Egypt, sent giant tortoises, the Singapore zoo
a crocodile, the Sydney zoo in Australia a kangaroo and two tapirs
arrived from the zoo in Lima, Peru.
   Bedouins, the nomads who live in Saudi Arabia's desert, brought
in lizards, a caracal and a hyena in the back of pick-up trucks.
And so it went, until the zoo's eclectic collection rivaled those
of its more established counterparts.
   ``We've got an Indian mynah who speaks Arabic, and a parrot who
speaks Swahili,'' said Curtis. ``He's next to a macaw from Brazil
and you know what they speak there (Portuguese). We really have a
multilingual zoo; it's like the United Nations.''
   Getting the animals to Riyadh was only half the chore.
   ``The big challenge was acclimatization,'' Curtis said. ``We had
to make a lot of modifications.'' Upon his arrival, he was given a
list of animals approved for acquisition but he rejected some as
inappropriate.
   A wild horse was scratched for want of adequate running space,
and several poisonous snakes were eliminated due to lack of staff
expertise in handling them. Many animals need special care in order
to thrive in Riyadh's desert climate.
   ``The key to acclimatization is spraying and misting systems, so
we installed a lot of that,'' Curtis said. The zoo also invested in
shade cloth, which cuts out 80 percent of sunlight in the summer
months, when temperatures often reach 122 degrees.
   Reptiles accustomed to high humidity are sprayed with water.
   Like his charges, Curtis seems to have adapted to his new
environment. He wears the local robes and headdress, known as a
thobe and ghutra.
   He takes frequent desert trips to study and photograph Saudi
Arabia's native fauna.
   ``This country has made remarkable progress. It has a big
commitment to conservation,'' Curtis said. ``They've already
created national parks, there's an endangered species list, and
we've got endangered species legislation coming up.''

BRITISH TOURIST'S DEATH IN PARK WAS MURDER, KENYA COURT RULES

A British tourist whose charred bones were found in a game park was murdered, a 
court ruled Friday, vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state 
investigators who claimed wild animals had killed her. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Julie Ward, 28, remains unsolved, however, with no one arrested 
and the judge saying he saw no need for further investigation. Ward's father 
has charged that there was an official cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative 
tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were found Sept. 13, 1988, 
in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve, a week after she reportedly left the 
world-renowned park while on a wildlife photography expedition. 
</P>
<P>
The state contended that she was eaten by carnivores after abandoning her 
vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home to lions, vultures, hyenas and 
leopards among other meat eaters. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England, contended she was 
murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He pleaded with the state to 
order an inquest and spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours 
in a private investigation of her death. 
</P>
<P>
"There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died of foul play by a 
person or persons unknown," Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango said at the 
conclusion of his inquiry, which began in mid-August and heard 38 witnesses 
before ending Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he "saw no reason" to investigate her death further and 
rejected claims by her family that the state had engaged in a cover-up to 
protect her killer or Kenya's $360-million annual tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
During the inquest, John Ward's attorney, Byron Georgiadis, had tried to build 
a case that Julie Ward was killed by someone who knew the game park well, had 
freedom of movement there and could have ordered or inspired a cover-up of the 
circumstances surrounding her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Simon Makallah, the Masai Mara's head game warden, as a chief 
suspect, contending the game warden was able to find the young woman's remains 
hours after her vehicle was found six miles away only because he already knew 
where the remains were. 
</P>
<P>
After the ruling, Ward said he was surprised at the outcome and that he had had 
"very serious doubts" Mango would rule in his favor. He called the ruling a 
"credit" to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, he came up with the verdict that was required," Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But asked if he was pleased with the ruling, he said: "How can you be pleased 
to have it confirmed that your daughter has been murdered? But, yes, I suppose 
I am pleased."

   A British tourist whose charred bones were

   The death of Julie Ward remains unsolved, however, with no one
arrested and the judge saying he saw no need for further
investigation. Ms. Ward's father has charged there was an official
cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative tourism industry.
   Ms. Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were
found on Sept. 13, 1988, in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve,
a week after she reportedly left the world-renowned park while on a
wildlife photography expedition.
   The state claimed the 28-year-old woman was eaten by carnivores
after abandoning her vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home
to lions, vultures, hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters.
   Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England,
contended she was murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He
pleaded with the state to order an inquest and spent tens of
thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in a private
investigation of her death.
   ``There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died
of foul play by a person or persons unknown,'' Chief Magistrate
Joseph Mango said at the conclusion of his inquiry, which began in
mid-August and heard 38 witnesses before ending Oct. 6.
   In rejecting the state's contention that Ms. Ward had been
killed by animals, Mango said: ``I think the animals are innocent.
If they are guilty at all, it is in eating what they found.''
   However, he said he ``saw no reason'' to investigate her death
further and rejected claims by her family that the state had
engaged in a cover-up to protect her killer or Kenya's $360 million
annual tourist trade.
   ``There has been a strong attack on the quality of the
investigations ... and allegations of a cover-up,'' Mango said.
``Of course the state does not admit this.''
   He further denied that Simon Makallah, the Masai Mara's chief
game warden, is or was a principal suspect in Ms. Ward's murder.
   During the inquest, Ward's attorney, Byron Georgiadis, had tried
to build a case that Ms. Ward was killed by someone who knew the
game park well, had freedom of movement there and could have
ordered or inspired a cover-up of the circumstances surrounding her
disappeareance.
   He pointed to Makallah as a chief suspect, contending the game
warden was able to find the young woman's remains hours after her
vehicle was located six miles away, only because he already knew
where they were.
   Mango, however, said there had been no evidence to suggest
Makallah and Ms. Ward ever met before her death and the fact that
he found her remains ``does not cast suspicion on Makallah.''
   Instead, he said investigators should have considered as prime
suspects two men Ms. Ward spent time with in the game park, neither
of whom appeared as witnesses at the inquest.
   After the ruling, Ward said he was surprised at the outcome and
that he had had ``very serious doubts'' Mango would rule in his
favor. He called the ruling a ``credit'' to Kenya.
   ``At the end of the day, he came up with the verdict that was
required,'' Ward said.
   But asked if he was pleased with the ruling, he said: ``How can
you be pleased to have it confirmed that your daughter has been
murdered? But, yes, I suppose I am pleased.''
   Ward repeated his belief there had been a cover-up and referred
to a British pathologist's report accepted by Mango as accurate
that proved his daughter had been hacked to pieces by a sharp
instrument and not torn apart by animals.
   A state pathologist's report said her remains had been cleanly
cut, but was later altered by a superior to say they had been
cracked and torn _ injuries more indicative of an animal's mauling.
   The British report was presented to Kenya's police commissioner
``months ago and he chose to ignore it,'' Ward said.
   Police have admitted several blunders in the case, including
failing to interview people in the area. In addition, a park gate
keeper admitted forging Ms. Ward's signature on a visitor's book to
show she had left the preserve.
   ``I'm not retracting anything about a cover-up,'' Ward said. He
added that he hoped police would work to solve the murder, despite
Mango's belief that the case did not require further investigation.
   ``This is a solvable crime,'' he said. ``Hopefully, the police
will do this now.''

FT  29 FEB 92 / Elephants and ivory: the battle that is being won
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLIGHT of the African elephant arouses high passions. Hunted down and
stripped of tusks and hide by poachers, their numbers in Africa slumped from
1.2m to 600,000 in a decade until, in 1989, CITES - the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species - banned the trade in ivory.
On Monday, when the CITES' 12-day triennial conference begins in Kyoto,
Japan, the wound will be re-opened. Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana,
Namibia and Malawi want the buying and selling of ivory and other elephant
products to resume in order to generate funds for protection and
preservation.
They claim that effective management of native elephant herds has meant that
populations are flourishing, and Zimbabwe even says culling may be needed to
reduce numbers. But conservationists fear that ending the ban will mean a
new wave of poaching, which could have drastic effects on nations to the
north. The debate will be stormy.
Here, IAIN DOUGLAS-HAMILTON, who has been battling for 25 years to protect
the world's largest land animal, explains the background to the meeting -
and the problems that continue to make a lasting solution so difficult.
IN SEPTEMBER 1991, two years after the CITES' ivory ban, a multi-national
team in nine light aircraft criss-crossed Kenya's Tsavo national park - a
wilderness of red earth, thorn bush and blue, faraway hills - looking for
elephants. Over five days, scanning every corner of the 43,000 sq km park,
6,800 live animals were spotted - up 9 per cent since the last count. Even
more important was the near-total absence of fresh carcasses.
Tsavo had been ravaged by poachers and ivory traders. But now, morale was
soaring. Corrupt park staff had gone and the new warden was a true
professional with properly-equipped forces which had confronted and defeated
the intruders. There were still plenty of armed men pouring into Kenya as
the civil war in Somalia raged to the north, but the trading ban meant that
ivory was devalued and not worth the risks any more.
It was a far different story only a few years earlier. After a brief golden
age for elephants in the 1950s and '60s, following the post-Second World War
establishment of national parks, a wave of poaching had spread from east
Africa, driven by the high ivory price and the demand for trinkets and name
stamps in far-off Japan, Europe and the United States. The poaching extended
far west through the equatorial forests and south to the Zambezi river.
Flying over Uganda in 1980, after the fall of dictator Idi Amin, we found a
holocaust. Elephants lay littered on the trails like crumpled leaves, the
wounded dragging their legs as they struggled to keep up with the terrified
herds. In the Murchison Falls national park, there were only 2,300 survivors
from 14,000 elephants in the 1960s.
There were gun battles in the parks as the authorities sought to deal with
the aggressive, heavily-armed poachers. Rangers were killed by Sudanese army
poachers in Kidepo until a determined campaign drove them out. Bodies of
dead poachers were left to be eaten by hyenas.
The problems of Uganda were mirrored time and again elsewhere. Collecting
information, with the help of scientific colleagues across Africa, we found
evidence of elephants speared, trapped, poisoned, burned or shot down with
automatic fire. At times, we came close to despair at the failure of one
initiative after another to stop the slaughter.
The only exceptions to the general trend were in southern Africa, south of
the Zambezi. But we feared the poaching inevitably would spread south, given
the high world demand for ivory.
Finally, in 1989, the sheer weight of evidence of abuse convinced African
governments and Western publics to back the ivory trade ban. And, in
general, there has been an improvement.
Contrary to predictions, it has proved policeable. In most countries, the
ivory price has dropped followed by a rapid decrease in poaching. This is
especially true in the parks and reserves of east Africa, once affected most
seriously. But at next week's CITES' conference in Kyoto, five southern
African nations want to re-open trading. It is a move opposed strongly by
most African countries to the north, which believe it would destroy their
elephants.
The traders sitting on stock-piles of ivory poached before the ban would
benefit the most, as any legal trade would send up the price. It would also
be impossible to prevent the mixing of legal and illegal stocks.
A possible compromise would be for the southern African countries to agree
not to trade in ivory and to confine trade to meat and skins; but there are
fears this would not be sufficiently binding. And yet, the southern African
countries, by giving up ivory sales over the past two years, have borne some
of the cost of keeping elephants alive elsewhere in Africa. Their altruistic
action has saved heavier costs in human and elephant lives, and money, that
would have been incurred by nations to the north.
But for northern countries - in particular, Kenya - keeping the ivory ban is
a matter of economic survival. There is no way it could cope with another
surge in poaching.
Despite Kenya and Zimbabwe being at either end of the spectrum, they have
common interests. Both believe the way forward will include an economic
programme to make wildlife self-sustaining.
Zimbabwe, with its 'camp-fire' programme, has pioneered projects to bring
money to local people from tourism, hunting and cropping exercises. Kenya
has made great strides in doubling its wildlife-based tourist revenues,
although this is being damaged at present by bandit attacks on visitors to
game reserves.
At the heart of the problem is a difference in philosophy between the
protectionist and utilisation lobbies. The arguments have been bitter at
times and represent a real clash of ideas.
The tragedy has been that conservationists on either side of the ivory
divide have fought each other rather than the illegal traders who were the
real enemy.
On the other hand, the matter of culling has now clouded the argument.
Although it is a repellent business, no one has yet come up with a solution
for over-population of elephants - something that is becoming an issue as
numbers grow. And whether you like it or not, culling is a sovereign right
of each country with elephants.
But a recent meeting of African elephant range states at the United Nations
Environment Programme revealed a distinctly encouraging mood. There is a
growing sense of collaboration between African states and a growing
willingness on the part of major donors, such as the US, the European
Community and its individual member-states, to fund elephant programmes
within their aid packages.
A united African initiative to resolve the thorny question of the ivory
trade would be better than any Western-led solution, however
well-intentioned. An African compromise which keeps the ivory trade shut
indefinitely would be worth the price of some nations selling skins from
properly-controlled culling operations. Ultimately, the fate of elephants
lies in the hands of the African peoples themselves.
Iain Douglas-Hamilton is adviser to the European Commission on its elephant
survey and conservation programme. He has also worked for the World Wildlife
Fund and for the New York Zoological Society. Together with his wife, Oira,
he has written the book Battle for the Elephants (Doubleday, Pounds 17.99).

<HEAD>Drive Launched in Oman to Save Rare Mountain Goat From Extinction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEREDITH CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation officials on Saturday announced
a renewed drive to save from extinction one of the world's rarest
mammals, the Arabian Tahr mountain goat.
   The campaign will combine a new captive breeding program and
continued efforts to protect the animals in the wild, said Ralph
Daly, conservation adviser to Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos.
   The remaining Arabian Tahr are found in the sultanate's northern
Hajar mountain range and in mountains in the neighboring United
Arab Emirates. There are believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 of
the goats left.
   The government established the Wadi Sarin Nature Reserve to
protect the goats after hunting them was banned in 1975. Mountain
tribesmen known as mushrafyn, or guardians, monitor the movements
of the goats in their remote reserve on 6,500-foot Jebel Aswad, or
Black Mountain.
   Daly said a breeding program for scientific study of around 14
Tahr is already under way at a captive breeding center. It will be
supplemented by a second breeding program ``to ensure we have
animals of different lines,'' he said.
   ``We believe it is vital to broaden the genetic base of the only
Tahr population left in the world,'' said Daly.
   The goats are related to the chamois and musk ox, and their
preferred habitat is steep, north-facing mountains. The Hajar range
runs in a crescent from the Strait of Hormuz in the north to the
edge of the Wahiba Sands in the southeast.
   The majority of the research work carried out for the government
has been led by Muscat-based British wildlife biologist Dr. Paul
Munton. He described the Arabian Tahr as ``not a well-adapted
desert dweller but a relic of a more temperature fauna.''
   The species, he said, is ``hanging on to life in the coolest and
most sheltered parts of the most difficult mountains of Arabia.''
   The goats eat fruit, seeds and grasses. They are hunted in the
wild by leopards, hyenas and wolves, and their young are prey to
eagles, ravens and red foxes.

   Rustlers armed with machetes and rifles
raided nomad camps at dawn and killed 192 people and injured 50 in
a remote part of northwestern Kenya, the government said Sunday.
   The rustlers stole about 3,500 cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys,
officials said. Forty of the 50 rustlers were captured and killed
and about 3,000 animals were recovered.
   The sky over the massacre scene was black with vultures. Hyenas
and other wild animals ravaged the bodies of the victims, said the
Sunday Nation, an independent newspaper.
   Laban Kitele, a minister of state in the office of the
president, said police tracked and killed about 40 of the 50
rustlers in a search aided by recent heavy rains in the district.
The rest escaped across the border to Sudan.
   Kitele said in a statement that the attackers were a well-armed
``terror gang'' of Sudanese from the Toposas tribe and Ndongiros
from Ethiopia.
   The attackers hit 30 nomadic camps about 30 miles west of the
border town of Lokichoggio on Wednesday. The semi-arid district,
whose mountains and rugged valleys make it inaccessible by car, is
near the borders of Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda.
   Police recovered 3,000 of about 3,500 animals stolen by the
rustlers, Kitele said.
   On March 30, rustlers hacked 15 nomads to death in northern
Kenya and stole 2,000 goats.
   ``Rustlers have lost all respect for human life to the extent
that they will massacre human beings in cold blood,'' Kitele said.
``I wish to warn anybody within Kenya or outside still harboring
ideas of rustling to desist. ... Government response to rustling
will always be prompt and aggressive hot pursuit.''
   In the latest incident, rustlers struck at 6 a.m. and killed
men, women and children with crude machetes and automatic and
semi-automatic rifles, Mohamed Yusuf Haji, the Rift Valley
provincial commissioner, told the Sunday Nation. The newspaper had
chartered a plane to the area.
   Haji said he found only bones and skulls left by scavenging
animals when he visited the scene.
   Rustling is a tradition among East Africa's nomadic tribes, who
regularly cross borders in search of pasture for their animals.

FT  08 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Success of excess - How to profit from a
visit to the energetically capitalist city of Budapest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Budapest education begins as soon as a visitor lands at Ferihegy airport.
Capitalism is at its rawest at the taxi rank. Appropriately known as
'hyenas', private cab drivers puncture rivals' tyres, collude cosily with
the airport authorities and the police, and charge more than double the
going rate.
But as ever in Hungary, there is a kis kapu, a side door, a way around every
problem. To avoid the hyenas, take the airport minibus. Or order a cab run
by Fotaxi, a state-owned company, by going to the Fotaxi desk or phoning
222-2222. Not only will you save Ft1,000 (Dollars 10); you can feel you have
done your bit for the free market.
The rule holds in town. Do not get into unmarked cars. Look for the oval
light and red checks of Fotaxi, or order one. Anyone who can get the better
of Hungarian taxis should coast through the rest of a business trip.
Economic reform started earlier in Hungary than elsewhere in eastern Europe.
The culture and infrastructure of commerce have had longer to develop and
mature. Despite all the frustrations, Budapest works. After all, about half
the direct investment in eastern Europe has gone to Hungary. Budapest, which
is the most populous city in east-central Europe with more than 2m
inhabitants, has regained its pre-communist position as a regional hub.
When it comes to accommodation, for luxury and convenience stay in the new
post-modern Kempinski hotel, in the commercial centre of Pest. For character
and architecture try the art nouveau Gellert on the Buda bank of the Danube.
Buy forints, the local currency, at the hotel. Hard currency is no longer
preferred tender. Those in search of east European adventure and a better
exchange rate can try the grey market. Deal only with the Arab
money-changers, who won't cheat you, on Petofi Sandor utca (street) or in
the Italian restaurant on Regiposta utca.
When you set out on your business appointments, make sure you have a thick
wad of business cards. Hungarians rival the Japanese in their enthusiasm for
the ritual of card-exchanging. Running out is embarrassing and damaging to
credibility.
Be careful how you read a Hungarian's name. The Hungarian style is to put
surname first, familiar name second. Foreigners often get confused, and are
inadvertently over-familiar with senior officials and executives. No matter
how many people are in the room, shake hands with everybody on arriving and
leaving, and on first and subsequent meetings, no matter how awkward it
seems.
It is imperative to ask someone with local knowledge - a consultant,
investment banker or commercial counsellor - to suggest or arrange meetings.
Go to the top, but not necessarily the very top. In many ministries and
Hungarian companies there is a younger English- or German-speaking official
who can tell you far more than his or her boss would.
Business attire is relaxed. Air-conditioning is rare at ministries and local
companies, so it is acceptable to wear short-sleeved shirts in summer.
Hungarians loosen ties and often dispense with them altogether by late
afternoon.
Inviting a business partner to lunch is a good way to establish a more
personal relationship, as it is in the west. The Kempinski, Kacsa and
Szinbad restaurants are safe choices. To impress, opt for the Gundel, a
grand restaurant next to the city zoo, refurbished at great expense by
George Lang.
Western expatriates often grow sick of Hungary's rich cuisine. Suggest
Amadeus or Cyrano, both in the city centre, for something lighter. Alcohol
with a meal is cus-tomary.
Budapest is more than a collection of hotels, ministries and company
headquarters connected by taxi rides. The city has one of the world's most
dramatic urban geographies. The Gellert hill in Buda rises sheer above the
Danube - it looms over the grand boulevards of Pest and the great Hungarian
plain beyond it. Budapest is livelier than pretty Prague, better preserved
than bombed-out Warsaw.
Start a summer evening in the courtyard of Kis Buda Gyongye, which offers
Hungarian food as light - and service as good - as it gets. Then sample the
nightlife, which has a rather raunchy tradition. Edward VII, while Prince of
Wales, was a fan of the notorious turn-of-the-century night clubs.
Nincs Pardon, Crazy Cafe and Paris Texas are among the better bars. The
discos of the moment are Saigon and Mad Block. The Tilos az A is a
three-level club where live bands and DJs vie to play some of the best and
worst music in town. Ring the bell at the Piaf piano bar, and round off the
evening watching drunken actors stumbling against the backdrop of red velvet
decor.
Saturday is no day to sleep in. The thermal baths close at noon. The Gellert
is the most famous, but insiders prefer the Rudas, which dates back to the
Turkish occupation.
Spend the afternoon drinking endless coffee and scoffing pastry in one of
Budapest's cafes, legacies of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The Gerbeaud is
the grandest, but overridden by tourists, so a better choice is the Muvesz,
opposite the neo-Renaissance Opera.
The elegant Cafe Gusto offers an alternative to the usual heart-attack
cakes; it has the best salads in town. Then again, this is Budapest, so
perhaps excess is in order.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Property: Carden Park up for sale - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers have put developer John Broome's project, Carden Park, Cheshire,
on the market, at the request of the Bank of Scotland.
Broome had set out to produce a hotel, golf, leisure and sport resort of
outstanding quality, spending Pounds 23m in the process.
Carden opened in October 1993 in 730 acres. Broome has established an
18-hole irrigated golf course on ground that varies between pine woods,
parkland and water meadows. Its complement is a beautifully-built golf
academy with a 13-bay driving range.
Carden also offers pheasant shooting on the estate, rough and driven, with
rights over a further 1,400 acres of adjacent land. There is also fishing
and rallying.
Croquet is the surprise. Broome laid down a 4.5-acre croquet lawn, of world
championship standards, which looks big enough to hold 10 games
simultaneously.
A vineyard above the croquet lawn produces a thoroughly drinkable Seyval
Blanc - the grapes go south to Bletchley for pressing - and there are plans
for a swimming pool and exercise centre in the walled kitchen garden.
The garden is some distance from the site of the former 'big house', a
typical Cheshire hall in black and white timbering that burnt down in 1912.
There is a large deer park and Broome's plan was to build a new big house,
or an 80-bedroom extension to the hotel, on the site of the old hall.
The hotel is set out in nine blocks around paved yards, and the rooms
classed as ambassador (lowest), earl, duke or Prince of Wales (one only).
All categories are of unusual comfort and luxury. There are also
self-catering cottages.
Situated near Manchester and Liverpool, and not too far from Birmingham,
this no-expenses-spared development should be a sure success, especially for
the corporate market and for croquet competitions.
Savills (0295-263535) has not indicated a guide price but the sum already
spent gives a top limit. It still needs Pounds 2m-3m for the exercise
centre, a clubhouse for the golf course and a central lounge/bar in the
hotel. Covered walkways between the hotel blocks would also be welcome. A
full information pack is available to serious potential buyers for Pounds
150, plus VAT.
This grand scheme is so nearly complete, and is so well done, that a good
profit must lie in store. Not, alas, for Broome, creator of the highly
successful Alton Towers amusement park, which now belongs to Pearson, owner
of the Financial Times.

<TEXT>
   Scientists at Kruger
National Park are recruiting tourists to help them track, count and
conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore
on the continent.
   The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one
distinct enough so individual animals can be identified from
photographs. Once scientists know how many wild dogs there are and
how they move, they will begin drawing up conservation plans.
   South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered
Wildlife Trust have started a contest to get tourists to take
pictures of the animals and send the prints in with information on
location, pack size and number of young.
   About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which
began in January and runs through July.
   The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park
and the runner-up prizes are photo equipment.
   ``We could drive through the park for a month and never see one
wild dog, but probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees
them. They stay close to the road and they are not scared of
vehicles,'' said Gus Mills, head of predator research at the park.
   He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest
group in Africa. Others are in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and parts
of East Africa.
   ``They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the
park. When that happens, they get into trouble,'' said Mills.
   Since wild dog packs hunt by day and don't fear humans, they are
easy targets for farmers protecting their livestock. Mills said a
farmer whose land borders the park recently shot 20 dogs.
   ``People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat
like the way the wolf is regarded in America,'' Mills said.
   Wild dogs travel in packs of up to 25 and need to kill three or
four impala to feed their members.
   Only one female and male in each pack breed, with the female
producing 10 to 15 pups and all members helping to raise the litter.

<HEAD>Hawks Have Almost Human-Like Ability To Stalk Prey, Researcher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time after time, the big jackrabbit avoids
attacks by the five Harris hawks that dive and feint with the
precision of a military unit. But finally, the rabbit is exhausted
and a powerful talon slashes quickly. The hunt ends and winged
predators feed together.
   In a report to be published Friday in Science magazine,
biologist James C. Bednarz said he repeatedly witnessed such
coordinated hunting by Harris hawks. It is, he said, the first
documented proof that hawks are able to organize and cooperate with
almost human skill in such a complex series of manuevers.
   ``People have suggested it in the past, but this is the first
documentation of it,'' said Bednarz, who is director of higher
education research at the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Kempton, Pa.,
and an associate professor at the University of New Mexico.
   ``We expected to see two hawks hunting together. I was amazed to
see units of four, five and six hawks. ... We got to see it
repeatedly,'' Bednarz said in a telephone interview.
   Cooperative hunting, in which predators work together to kill
prey larger than they could bring down individually, is well known
among lions, wolves, hyenas, wild dogs, killer whales _ and humans.
But Bednarz said his study shows that hawks also are able to hunt
together for their mutual benefit.
   In more than 400 hours of observations at the Los Medanos Raptor
Area near Carlsbad, N.M., Bednarz said he watched groups of five to
six hawks use two basic coordinated attacks to bring down rabbits.
   Bednarz said the most common tactic, which he called the
surprise pounce, required the hawks to attack a rabbit from several
different directions at once, forcing it to stay away from cover.
   ``They will work the rabbit in such a way that it becomes
mentally and physically exhausted,'' Bednarz said. ``They keep it
moving and keep it making decisions until it makes the wrong
decision.''
   Bednarz said if the rabbit leaves its back unprotected, a hawk
swoops in and delivers a lethal blow to the back of the neck.
That's the only way, said Bednarz, that a Harris hawk, which weighs
about 2 pounds, can kill a jackrabbit, which can weigh as much as 7
pounds.
   Another tactic Bednarz observed is what he calls the ``flush and
ambush.''
   A team of hawks, e said, will chase a rabbit until it finally
takes cover. Two or three hawks will perch nearby and a pair of the
birds will land near the rabbit and try to flush it from the cover.
When the bunny finally flees, the perched hawks drop swiftly for
the kill.
   Even dinner time is coordinated for the Harris hawks, Bednarz
said.
   When the hawks are feeding, two of the group will remain at a
nearby high place, on the lookout for eagles or ospreys or other
species who might try to steal the kill. When an intruder is
spotted, the sentinel will sound an alarm and the Harris hawks rise
and attack together, usually chasing away the invader.
   Bednarz said most of the hawk groups that hunt together are
extended families that may include a mated pair, yearlings and
older offspring. The group usually is no larger than six.
   The female is the larger of the Harris hawks and usually
dominates the group, Bednarz said. But on the hunt, the female is
less likely to attack the prey and more likely to play ``a
distractor role.''
   ``She distracts the prey and keeps it in play for the other
hawks, forcing it back into the area of vulnerability,'' the
researcher said.
   He said birds seem to communicate with body movement. As the
hunt begins, he birds will perch hundreds of yards apart. When one
of the hawks sights a possible meal, its movement quickly attracts
the other birds and the hunt is on, Bednarz said.
   Harris hawks live in the deserts of Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico. They feed on rodents and lizards during part of the year,
but apparently hunt together to bring down jackrabbits and desert
cottontail rabbits in the winter months.

for many generations. Now, ``outsiders'' _ performers who weren't
born into circus dynasties _ are juggling love and careers under
the Big Top, too.
   At the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, such acts
include The Palacios; The Flying Guttys (he's ``circus,'' she's
``outsider''); Tommy and Tammy Parish, natives of Neodesha, Kan.,
who love to clown around together; and American-Canadian animal act
Lee and Judith Stevens, who consider themselves parents of 16: two
kids and 14 baboons.
   ``Before, when a child was born into a circus family it was
taken for granted they would continue the act,'' Judith Stevens
said. ``Now, you're here because you are very good _ not just
because you were born here.''
   ``My father worked 43 years at something he couldn't stand,''
added her husband. ``We're here because we want to be.''
   The Stevenses met in Canada in February 1985, while working at a
different circus. They married four months later; two years after
that, they took the baboons on their ``honeymoon'' _ a working trip
to Bermuda.
   ``We're just normal people doing unusual jobs,'' Judith says.
``In a lot of ways, it can be real hard; we never go home from
work.''
   The Stevenses often travel with their sons, Alexander, 3{, and
Sebastian, 2. In all, 20 children _ newborn to 14 years old _ tour
with this community-on-wheels, which employs 150 performers and 200
other workers. School-age children study twice a day with Natalie
Osbourne, a dancer and certified teacher. Younger kids can stay at
the traveling day-care center.
   ``It's a special day for a child to go to the zoo or the circus;
my kids have that every day,'' said Judith.
   Alexander sometimes appears in the baboon act. ``He loves to do
it,'' his mother said. ``He says, `Mommy, where's my costume?'''
   But the Stevenses are no stage parents. Judith fantasizes that
her sons will grow up to be doctors or lawyers: ``Isn't that always
a mother's dream?''

   Marcia Palacio's mother never dreamed that her daughter would
work in a cage with three tigers, two lions, three leopards, two
bears, two hyenas and a wolf. Neither, for that matter, did she.
   ``My father's never seen the circus,'' said Palacio, who is from
Staines, England. ``When my mother saw me work, she went through
two packets of cigarettes. I heard her scream.''
   It all started nine years ago, when the former ballet dancer,
then known as Marcia Spence, met animal trainer Luis Palacio, a
native of Tijuana, Mexico.
   First, they became a couple; then, they became co-workers.
Marcia started tending baby animals, learning the ropes from Luis,
who had worked for circuses since he was 11 years old. In 1988, she
stepped into the cage with her husband and the big beasts.
   ``I was terrified,'' she recalled.
   But she went into it with her eyes open.
   On July 18, 1986, during another circus in England, Marcia
Palacio had watched in horror from outside the cage as a lion bit
and slashed Luis. The badly mauled trainer finally returned to work
in May 1988, with a jagged scar across his jugular.
   ``Marcia went through the whole thing,'' Luis said. ``She was
there when it happened, and there through the surgery. She nursed
me and learned to change the tracheotomy and do injections.''
   After he recovered, Ringling had an opening for a two-person
act. Despite the job hazard she'd witnessed, Marcia wanted to try
it.
   Now, Luis performs with several animals at the front of the cage
while Marcia controls the remaining animals at the rear. At the
finale, Marcia rides a tiger around the ring.
   ``It's very difficult to separate the relationship inside the
cage and outside,'' said Luis. ``Sometimes, when she makes a
mistake, I scream at her; that's how I was taught. But I'm
growing.''
   The two relax by sightseeing. But even a brave lion-trainer has
fears. Asked if they saw the Empire State Building while working in
New York City, Luis shrugged.
   ``We'd have to go up,'' he said. ``I don't like going up.''

   Going up is no problem for Jid and Laurie Gutty. Flying 32 feet
above the floor is their equivalent of a day at the office.
   Laurie had just graduated from high school in Pompano Beach,
Fla., nine years ago when she saw Jid, a native of Bogota,
Colombia, practicing his trapeze act at an Orlando campground. At
first they were just friends; it was the trapeze that made her
heart flutter.
   ``I fell in love with it,'' she said. ``Something told me it was
a way for me to do something special.''
   First time she flew, ``I cried. I was very scared of the height.
But I knew in my heart I could do it somehow,'' she said.
   After years of physical conditioning, Laurie became the only
American woman to master a triple aerial somersault.
   Now, Jid is her husband, as well as her catcher. His face lights
up when he talks about the circus _ and about his wife's
accomplishments.
   ``I love what I'm doing,'' he said. ``When an audience responds,
when people like me, I feel proud. And I'm proud of what she's
doing, too.''
   How do they balance the demands of living and working together?
   ``You have to communicate a lot,'' he said. ``You need to talk
to each other all the time on the trapeze.''
   ``It's very hard,'' said Laurie. ``You have to separate your
personal life from your professional life. And you still have to
trust each other: Even though you're arguing, you still know he's
there to catch you.''

   The danger is even present for Clown Alley veterans. Tommy
Parish ticks off accident stories involving stilts and a runaway
elephant cart.
   ``Nothing serious _ a few broken bones,'' said Parish, whose
clown cowlick and bulbous, red schnoz belie a modest, shy
personality.
   But the pratfall is no pitfall for a two-clown couple.
   Especially the Parishes, who became hard-core circus fans while
growing up together in Kansas.
   Twelve years ago, Tammy Parish was attending ``regular-people
college'' when her husband-to-be went to clown college in Florida
and won a job with Ringling. She followed his career path a year
later. Since then, they estimate they've played to more than 55
million people.
   Their clowning carries over into their personal lives.
   On Valentine's Day, Tammy sang her undying love for Tommy,
accompanied by an original accordion arrangement. Then, she hit him
with a pie that was hidden in a big, red heart. ``I can't carry a
tune in a bucket, but Tom was touched, anyway,'' she says.
   The Parishes say they have it better than other circus couples.
When tempers flare, noted Tammy, ``We have access to foam hammers.''

<HEAD>Anthrax Killing Animals in South African Game Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of anthrax in
Kruger National Park has killed more than 200 animals, including
buffalo, impala, jackals, lions and elephants, the park's head of
research said.
   Vossie de Vos told the South African Broadcasting Co. on Tuesday
that an innoculation campaign had started against the disease. The
last major anthrax outbreak in the huge game park in northeastern
South Africa was in 1970.
   Anthrax is caused by tiny flesh-eating flies that lodge in the
wounds of animals and lay eggs. The disease can be transmitted to
humans, but can be halted by washing the wounds.

TOURISTS RECRUITED TO PRESERVE WILD DOGS

KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists at Kruger National Park are recruiting tourists to help them track, 
count and conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore on 
the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one distinct enough 
so individual animals can be identified from photographs. Once scientists know 
how many wild dogs there are and how they move, they will begin drawing up 
conservation plans. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered Wildlife Trust 
have started a contest to get tourists to take pictures of the animals and send 
the prints in with information on location, pack size and number of young. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which began in 
January and runs through July. 
</P>
<P>
The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park and the 
runner-up prizes are photo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Scared of Vehicles' 
</P>
<P>
"We could drive through the park for a month and never see one wild dog, but 
probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees them. They stay close to 
the road and they are not scared of vehicles," said Gus Mills, head of predator 
research at the park. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest group in 
Africa. Others are in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and parts of East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the park. When that 
happens, they get into trouble," said Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Since wild dog packs hunt by day and don't fear humans, they are easy targets 
for farmers protecting their livestock. Mills said a farmer whose land borders 
the park recently shot 20 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat like the way 
the wolf is regarded in America," Mills said.

Laurie Reker, with the greatest of ease, fell for Jid Gutty on the flying

PETER ADAMS: A RENAISSANCE MAN OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Adams, with his great blue eyes, is living life more intensely than the 
rest of us. He's passionate about art, passionate about travel, passionate 
about history and people, passionate about spiders. 
</P>
<P>
Chat with him and he takes the paintings off the walls, digs in his archives to 
find a Bouguereau print, tells of his escapades in 1981 as the first American 
artist to travel unescorted after China reopened, and his trip a year ago to 
Afghanistan, where he painted and visited wounded moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
Interpersed is the tale of his excursion down an Afghanistan well to retrieve a 
cat. He also writes sonnets. 
</P>
<P>
As a guest ambles through his home and studio on an oak and ivy bluff in 
Pasadena, he throws open closets and models his Far Eastern costumes 
collection. And when he finds a spider on a Russian fur cap, he cradles it in 
his palm, opens a window and blows it to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
One painting of his is a Bhutan fort. Another a Mandarin emblem, another a 
rosewood lamp. The dozens of embroidered pillowcases are Indian. And the 
Tibetan singing bowls require a demonstration: He carefully holds one, rubs it 
round and round, faster and faster, and the bowl hums. In the kitchen, he 
brings out fresh juices to thwart the hot day and the lack of air conditioning. 
And those four dogs on the back porch wagging their tails -- they're the ones 
he runs with every other day on Millard Canyon trails. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Adams, tall and 38, is a novelty, a tender eccentric. Right now, to his 
milieu, he's added the chairmanship of the Festival of the Autumn Moon benefit 
for the Pacific Asia Museum. It's a two-part arrangement -- an open house and 
silent auction for the public Sept. 24 in the museum's Chinese courtyard, and a 
gala dinner and fine art auction Oct. 7 (attire Oriental, tickets $175, catered 
by Rococo) in a decorated tent at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Up for auction will be an 1880 Steinway piano, rare and important Buddhist art 
of the Ming Dynasty, a balloon trip over France's Burgundy terrain, a Ch'ing 
Dynasty lady's robe of embroidered amethyst gauze, a woodblock print by Toradji 
Ishikawa. For starters. Also on the block -- a luxury trip to Japan. Lisa 
Hubbard of Sotheby's will be auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
Adams comes from a unique family. His late grandmother, Aileen Macdonald, who 
traveled to China many times and collected Oriental art, was a great influence. 
His late aunt Julie Macdonald was a sculptor and an eccentric who kept baboons 
and hyenas as well as seven or eight dogs in her home, and who, when Ambassador 
College opened, had her daughter streak at the opening because of her objection 
to the building in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
His father, the late Peter Adams, was a part-time actor ("The Robe") and 
businessman. His late grandfather Morgan Adams at one time "owned half of Lake 
Arrowhead," and, adds Peter, "one of his yachts was the first to go through the 
locks of the Panama Canal." His late maternal grandfather George B. Seitz was a 
painter at the Philadelphia Art Academy and became a successful director and 
producer of the "Andy Hardy" series with Pearl White and Mickey Rooney, and, 
according to Adams, is credited with discovering George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
The artistic bent was there. When Adams attended Harvard preparatory school, he 
disliked the paintings in the cafeteria, "So I stole some paints and put up my 
paintings and called myself Von Seitz." Later, he studied at Cal Western in San 
Diego, the Art Center, Otis Art Institute and in Theodore Lukits' studio. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Adams' paintings -- umbrella scenes at the Beach Club, children in 
gardens, the Summer Palace Bejing, air scenes of Pasadena and national parks, 
Tibetan monasteries, the Sierra, moujahedeen on the march -- hang in private 
collections at the California Club and Curtis and Chadwick Schools. 
</P>
<P>
He returned from China with more than 200 paintings. To paint in Afghanistan, 
he dyed his hair, grew a beard, marched with the moujahedeen, painting them and 
later donating proceeds from many of the paintings to the International Medical 
Corps. Only after he returned did he learn a $10,000 bounty was offered on 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of painting these recent days, Adams has been rounding up art for the 
benefit and hosting a pre-party at the home of his uncle Morgan Adams in 
Hancock Park to honor donors.

   A plane ferrying American
cigarettes to Moscow crash-landed in flames northeast of Prague.
The six-member crew survived, but looters made off with some of the
cargo.
   The Tupolev 154 was carrying 15 tons of American-made cigarettes
to the Soviet capital from Switzerland on Saturday when fire broke
out on board, the Rude Pravo newpaper said.
   The three-engine Soviet plane landed in a field near Dvur
Kralove, about 75 miles northeast of Prague.
   The jet was on fire when it landed, and it took several hours
for firefighters to extinguish the blaze, another newspaper,
Obcansky Denik, reported. Some of the cargo was saturated with jet
fuel and burned, the paper said.
   ``It is incredible that all six memebers of the crew survived,
nobody was seriously hurt,'' the daily quoted Dr. Jarosalv Houf as
saying.
   On Sunday, Czechoslovak television accused residents of acting
like hyenas. It broadcast footage showing dozens of people
retrieving packages of cigarettes from the wrecked fuselage.
   ``When trying to put things right, the police heard verbal abuse
impossible to use in print,'' Rude Pravo said.
   A pack of American cigarettes is worth 50 Czechoslovak crowns,
or $2. The average monthly salary in Czechoslovakia would buy only
about 60 packs of such cigarettes.

<HEAD>`Miss Daisy' Says Oscar Movie Started With Endowed Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jessica Tandy, one of several artists
supporting government financial support for the arts, says the
movie for which she won an academy award this year owes a debt to
the National Endowment for the Arts.
   The 80-year-old performer, winner of the best actress award for
her lead role in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' told a congressional panel
Tuesday that the movie was based on a 1987 play that had received
money from the endowment.
   The endowment has come under close scrutiny since last year when
conservative lawmakers pointed out that a few exhibits receiving
NEA funds contained art that many would consider objectionable,
sacrilegious or obscene.
   The most outspoken criticism of efforts to put conditions on NEA
funding came from theater producer Joseph Papp, who this year
refused a $50,000 grant because of restrictions placed on funding.
   Papp referred to the congressional critics of NEA as ``jackals
and hyenas'' ready to pounce upon an endowment that was weakened by
constant underfunding during the Reagan administration.
   This year's appropriation for the NEA requires that art grants
be reviewed for possibly objectionable content.
   The subcommittee that heard from Papp, Miss Tandy and several
other artists is conducting hearings on a request for $175 million
in fiscal 1991 for the NEA.

<TEXT>
   Small planes are flying tons of food to
thousands of starving civil war refugees, but relief officials say
fighting and flooding will keep help from reaching hundreds of
thousands in remote areas.
   Twin-engine Cessnas on Sunday flew some of the 90 tons of food
to about 40,000 people jammed into Abyei, 500 miles southwest of
the capital, Khartoum. The $1 million U.S.-financed airlift began
Thursday and is to last 10 days.
   Brian Wannop, a representative of the U.N. Development Program
in Khartoum, said officials visiting Abyei in the past few days
said the emaciated southerners were too weak to prevent scavenging
hyenas from dragging away the bodies of relatives at night.
   The refugees left behind their crops and cattle to escape a
civil war between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, fighting for economic and political reform since 1983 and
claiming to control 90 percent of the southern countryside.
   The group, demanding autonomy for the Christian and animist
African south from the Moslem-dominated government in the north,
has shot down relief planes because they say the flights may be
military-related. Abyei is just beyond the reach of the fighting.
   Western relief officials say the airlift to Abyei is tiny
compared to the extent of devastation facing hundreds of thousands
of others in less accessible areas.
   Wannop said that in the past five years of the civil war, about
2 million southerners fled their homes to camps and shantytowns in
southeastern Ethiopia, central and western Sudan and around the
capital of Khartoum. He said 150,000 people fled to the western
region of Darfur and south Kordofan, where Abyei is located.
   A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks
before the impact of the supply mission could be felt. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight to 10
people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment and a
long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.
   An estimated 80 people a day died in the area's refugee camps in
July and August, the worst months in a summer that some relief
officials say took up to 10,000 lives. They said most were the
elderly or young children.
   Wannop said a possible explanation for the lower death rate was
that all the younger children had already died during the difficult
summer months.
   The Sudanese Red Crescent says Abyei's population of 10,000 has
swelled to 40,000 by displaced people.
   Sudanese officials say the Western agencies are exaggerating the
number of refugees throughout the south and that the government has
drawn up a plan to supply relief to about 224,000 people.
   ``The people affected by the famine and starvation are moving
northward,'' said Haj Tayeb, Sudan's acting commissioner for relief
and rehabilitation. ``We reached some of them and gave them aid.''
   The government earlier expelled several Western relief agencies
for allegedly working with the rebels to get supplies to stranded
southerners.
   Heavy rains and floods in August have exacerbated conditions for
the southerners and hampered efforts by Sudanese and foreign relief
agencies to help them.
   Relief food and medicines last reached Abyei in June, before
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government halted relief operations
during the rainy season, when the guerrilla war intensified.
   Rebel gunners shot down two relief planes in 1986 and 1987,
killing more than 70 people.

<LEADPARA>  TED Turner's two cable entertainment networks -- TBS and TNT -- are gradually

 If you want proof, check out tonight's premiere of "The Trials of Life," a
new 12-hour nature series from TV's leading naturalist, Sir David
Attenborough, maker of the acclaimed "Life on Earth" and "The Living Planet"
series.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This is an absolutely spellbinding series that examines all the steps in
the life cycles of a diverse assortment of Earth's creatures, from birth to
death. Produced as a series of one-hour programs, "Trials" will be shown two
at a time by TNT in six two-hour installments, tonight through Friday night.; 
  Attenborough used 40 camera operators to capture the marvelous sights you'll
see, spending two years filming on every continent. As usual, he's there on
the scene, letting crabs crawl over him, pulling a baby opossum out of his
shirt or feeding a caterpillar to a wasp off his bare hand.;     Ordeal of
birth;  In the first hour, appropriately called "Arriving," the abiding theme
is the awesome ordeal of birth. I guarantee you'll be blown away by what you
see, including:;    (check)  Tens of thousands of mother crabs crossing the
sands of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean at midnight to deposit millions
of eggs in the water at high tide.;    (check)  Aerial views of billions of
herring eggs, forming milky slicks along the coastline. When the tide
subsides, there are so many eggs that they resemble snow drifts at the water's
edge.;    (check)  Hundreds of squirming mantis eggs hatching from a single
egg mass.;    (check)  A devoted female wasp digging a hole for her eggs in
hard-baked earth in the American southwest, then hunting caterpillars to stuff
into the hole to serve as ready food for the hatching young.;    (check)  A
hyena giving birth in the privacy of her underground den, then cuddling her
newborn pups in a profound demonstration of mother love.;    (check)  Mother
bats weaving "safety nets" to catch their emerging babies, so they won't fall
to their death on the cavern floor.;    Tonight's second hour follows the new
arrivals into the hazards of their first few days of life. And they're often
severe ones.;    Baby elephant seals must avoid the rushes of huge adult seals
and fend for themselves when their starving mothers swim off to feed for the
first time in weeks. Tiger sharks raid the "flying school" for baby seabirds,
dining on the ones who get airborne too slowly. And so forth.;    It's amazing
to see what Attenborough's cameras have caught. It must have taken infinite
patience to spot a mother lace bug defending her young against a jumping
spider or baby scorpions clambering onto their mother's shell-like back to
nestle under her venomous stinger.;    But this isn't just a collection of
"amazing" snapshots. Attenborough makes certain viewers learn from what they
see. When an Australian crocodile is filmed kicking dead leaves over her eggs,
we learn the decaying leaves create the heat necessary to determine the sex of
the baby crocs. If it reaches 32 degrees centigrade, all the babies will be
male. At 30 degrees, they'll all be female. Temperatures in between provide
some of each.;     Eyeing bats;  Researchers for "The Trials of Life" even
discovered how mother bats identify their own babies when they return from
nightly feeding to a cavern roof packed with millions of baby bats: They can
pick the cries of their own babies out of all that screeching!;    They even
show us why an Arctic fox doesn't quickly gobble a large egg he steals after
being chased and pecked by a covey of mother snow geese: He knows the
egg-laying won't last long, so he buries his catch and runs back to try for
more before it's too late.;    If you love nature films, you mustn't miss a
moment of this spectacular series. (box)  </TEXT>

FT  29 FEB 92 / Travel: Strange beauty of a stark land - The fragile, cruel
desert of the Skeleton Coast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTS of Namibia's Skeleton Coast are so ecologically fragile that Land
Rover tracks take hundreds of years to heal. In the desert heat a discarded
banana peel does not rot, but shrivels and ossifies.
If man's presence threatens to scar the region, the Skeleton Coast pays back
in kind. The area owes its name to the innumerable shipwrecked sailors who
lost their way in milky Atlantic fogs and found themselves abandoned to the
grit of the great Namib desert. Bleached bones and hulks of galleons bear
witness to their fate.
These days the area is a national park, a sliver of coastline stretching
hundreds of miles from Cape Cross to the Angolan border. The northern
section has been declared a wilderness area; not a road, not a house, not a
car nor a train disturbs its bleak silence.
On my visit I flew with Louw Schoeman, the region's sole concessionaire and
self-appointed environmental guardian. To do so is to join a privileged set
comprising only a few hundred people a year. Our group of eight left
Windhoek's Eros airport in two light aircraft early one April morning. The
first aircraft was piloted by Schoeman himself, a weatherbeaten Afrikaner
with a mellifluous voice, silvery hair and a grey moustache. The second was
flown by his son, Bertus, a shy geologist.
The flight to the desert base camp took three hours - ample time to
contemplate the vastness of this arid country, four times the size of
Britain but home to only 1.4m people. It is so large that an airport built
in 1966 outside Windhoek has been lost. When a local gliding club asked for
permission to land there, the authorities denied its existence.
Bertus rarely flew higher than a few hundred feet and often considerably
lower. When he spied the strange Welwitschia mirabilis, he banked the
aircraft sharply and swooped so low I thought I saw insects crawling over
the plant's leathery leaves.
This living fossil grows only two huge leaves in a life that spans hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of years. It crawls from the baked earth like some
surreal spider and sustains itself, like so many plants on the Skeleton
Coast, from the moisture borne by the daily fogs.
We refuelled at the resort of Swakopmund before following the coast north.
As our aircraft buzzed along, Bertus casually served up a series of stunning
sights.
There were lurid purple and pink salt pans; thousands of flamingos which
scattered in a tumult of wings, beaks and legs; a colony of 120,000 seals
lined up along the shore at Cape Cross.
We landed at Sarusas camp, some 20km inland, on a strip so rough it was
almost indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain. Sarusas is the oldest
of Louw's four camps. It comprises a handful of deluxe tents, a solar-heated
shower unit and a wooden trestle table set beneath one of the region's rare
trees. The aim is to keep the camp as unobtrusive as possible, Louw's
philosophy being, as he solemnly puts it, 'to bring nothing to the desert
and to take nothing away.'
The old Afrikaner has an infectious enthusiasm for the desert. Several times
we found him lying on his stomach peering at the sand through a magnifying
glass. This rather undignified exercise revealed, quite miraculously, grains
of blue, green, red, white, black and yellow sand like a collection of
costume jewellery.
On other occasions, Louw would thrust his wooden walking stick at points of
interest. In this way he indicated the sandy covering to the trap-door
spider's lair, the dust-dry lichens that bloomed into flower on contact with
water, the tracks of the brown-backed hyena and the stone circles that may
long ago have been bushmen's huts.
We made trips by Land Rover, across the desert's pancake-flat plains or over
its stark lava rocks. It was on one such occasion that we came upon the
'roaring dunes.'
The Namib is scattered with all types of dunes. Some of them march (up to 15
metres a year), some are streaked blood-red with garnet, some are
mountainous. Only the roaring dunes roar.
At first, the sight of Louw sliding down the near-sheer surface of the sandy
crest caused me some bewilderment. But, as he disappeared far below, the
ground started to buzz, hum and finally to thunder. It was like the roar of
B-52 bombers rumbling overhead. The friction between the bone-dry grains of
sand was being amplified in the sickle-shaped dune as though the rim of a
giant wine glass was being rubbed by an unseen hand.
The roaring dunes were not the only wonder of the world's oldest desert.
There were also the 'waterfalls' of pure sand, the desert zebra which
somehow eked out an existence and the yellowish clay 'temples' of the
Hoarusib canyon.
The latter, formed perhaps 30,000 years ago from the silt deposits of a
long-dried-up river, had an extraordinary man-made quality. Many were
symmetrical pharaonic-type structures; others took on the shapes of huge
stone heads, fortresses with yawning doors and windows, or columned palaces
with gargoyles leering over balustrades of clay.
It gave the eerie impression that this was some long-abandoned city or that
hidden inhabitants were peering at us from the cavernous interiors of its
gargantuan structures.
Louw maintained this level of spectacle on each of our five days in the
desert. We flew to two further camps, one on the ghostly coast at Cape Frio,
the second perched above the black Kunene river which glimmered like sheet
metal as the sun set over the Angolan border.
Once Louw flew us to meet some of the Himba cattle herders involved in his
conservation efforts. The region used to be home to many desert elephant and
rhino but most were butchered during Namibia's civil war. Now numbers are
slowly beginning to recover.
The Himba, whom Louw pays to elect game wardens, have lived an isolated
nomadic existence for centuries. When they came into contact with whites
last century, some adopted Victorian dress which they have worn ever since.
Others did not change their customs, but continued to coat their naked
bodies in a beautifying and protective red dye.
We were introduced to two Himba women in Purros village. One wore a frilly
Victorian dress with layers of petticoats covering her ankles. She showed
not the slightest embarrassment as her naked friend smeared her own breasts
with a reddish paste of goat fat in front of eight leering foreigners.
As we pulled into the air for our return journey to Windhoek, the immensity
of the desert, inconceivable from the ground, again became apparent. The
bulging lava flows, endless plains of black sand and interlayered rock bore
out the bushmen's description of 'the land God made in anger.' Anger must
have been one of God's most spectacular and creative moods.

VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after 2:30 one sunny December afternoon I met the button man. 
</P>
<P>
He stepped forward to take my luggage as I climbed from the bus that brought me 
from the airport, a half-hour ride away through the cracklingly dry bush 
country of northern Matabeleland. 
</P>
<P>
I forget his name, perhaps because I was so intrigued by his coat and hat, 
which were covered in buttons and badges of every sort and color. He was the 
doorman at the Victoria Falls Hotel, and his grin of welcome was warm and 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel itself is a splendid structure, worthy of its long-held reputation as 
one of Africa's finest. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1904 when the projected Cape-to-Cairo railway line finally reached the 
Zambesi River, it started life as little more than a wood and corrugated-iron 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Less than half a century later it was playing host to England's Royal Family 
when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret 
stayed there. Today, it and the equally famed Meikles Hotel in Harare are known 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the Victoria Falls Hotel has the edge in location, sited a few hundred 
yards from one of the world's great natural wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors have been coming to Victoria Falls ever since Scottish explorer and 
missionary David Livingstone came across them on Nov. 16, 1855, and named them 
in honor of his queen. Before that the natives knew them by a more colorful 
name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, the Smoke That Thunders. 
</P>
<P>
I quickly unpacked and intended to walk immediately down to the falls, but 
three things delayed me. 
</P>
<P>
First were the mango trees that surround the hotel. Their branches seemed alive 
and, on closer inspection, I found a colony of vervet monkeys, some clutching 
young to their breasts, gathering mangoes. Apparently they were regular 
visitors at this time of year when the fruit begins to ripen. 
</P>
<P>
Next it was the swimming pool that stopped me or, more specifically, the sight 
of a pool attendant furiously chasing a troop of baboons off the surrounding 
lawn and back into the nearby bush. This, they said later, happens almost every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, stepping out onto the hotel's broad terrace, where an African marimba 
band entertains beneath 200-year-old mahogany trees, I was brought to a 
standstill by the view. 
</P>
<P>
The sight, in the afternoon light, with clouds gathering on the horizon and the 
sun at just the right angle, was spectacular. In the foreground, shaded lawns 
and flawless gardens gave way to unspoiled bush in hues of green and yellow. In 
its midst stood the iron railway bridge, completed a year after the hotel and 
spanning the river-carved chasm of red-brown rock that separates Zimbabwe from 
Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
One 1952 handbook mentions a story, apparently well authenticated, that when 
the bridge was officially opened in 1905, one party member tried to determine 
the depth of the gorge below. 
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose," said the handbook, "he picked up a stone and took out his 
watch to note the time taken by the stone to reach the water. Absent-mindedly, 
he dropped his watch into the gorge and found himself timing its descent by the 
stone in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't want to lose any time, either, and set out to walk to the curtain of 
rising mist and the distant roar that signaled the waterfall, the Smoke That 
Thunders. 
</P>
<P>
A winding path of sand zigzags down to the river, and along this path curio 
sellers had set up shop on the ground every 50 feet or so, displaying carved 
wooden animals, tribal masks of every size and native jewelry in assorted 
styles and colors. 
</P>
<P>
Getting past them without succumbing to their pleas -- "Buy a happy hippo, sir. 
Very cheap." -- was an art itself. Finally I reached the entrance to Victoria 
Falls National Park, its area fenced to protect it from both human and animal 
deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
Which way to go? Left or right? By then the clouds had built up overhead and 
rain seemed a distinct possibility. I chose to head left, toward what my map 
said was a statue honoring Livingstone. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't make it. Having climbed down the 73 forest-canopied steps leading to a 
view of the Western or Devil's Cataract, I was taking photographs when I felt 
the first drop of rain on my arm. 
</P>
<P>
In Africa, storms arrive with a startling suddenness. At first I hoped the 
trees would keep me dry. They didn't. I hurried back up the steps that were 
already becoming slippery, retraced my way and sought shelter with some equally 
soaked but broadly smiling Africans beneath a sort of thatched roof structure 
of unknown purpose. 
</P>
<P>
We waited. The rain, like the air, was warm, and I was not cold. The downpour 
increased, the thatch leaked, the floor of the shelter flooded and what had 
been a path a few moments before was a swiftly moving stream. 
</P>
<P>
Standing there, drenched to the skin, I thought back to the news story I read 
in the Bulletin just a few hours earlier during the drive from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The continuing drought throughout Matabeleland has reached crisis proportions, 
according to highly placed officials who view with alarm the worsening 
conditions among the human and animal populations," the story said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of head of cattle have already died in the rural areas, and even if 
rain falls this month, thousands more will perish from starvation and lack of 
water during the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Weak, emaciated and starving cattle are now a common sight, trying desperately 
to find nourishment on road verges throughout the two provinces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hazard to Motorists 
</P>
<P>
"These are posing a hazard to passing motorists, some of whom have been 
unfortunate enough to hit beasts lying in the road after dark." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the drought was at an end and the long-awaited summer rains had 
arrived. That was why the Africans were smiling. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting for an hour or so and seeing the downpour intensify rather than 
slacken, I left the shelter and, in a stooping half-walk, half-run, trying all 
the while to protect my camera, stumbled back up the path to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The curio sellers, too, had abandoned their posts and the return trip was 
uneventful, although not without some loss of face at its conclusion. Guests 
and staff alike stared and smiled as I left a trail of sodden footprints across 
the hotel's plush carpets en route to my room. 
</P>
<P>
A shower, a change of clothes and a whiskey or two at the I Presume bar were 
enough to dispel any negative thoughts, however, and the storm became enjoyable 
as evening turned to night. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for instance, the dramatic sight of the lightning over the darkened 
bush, each jagged spear accompanied by thunder of such ferocity that the walls 
seemed to tremble. And there was the ludicrous moment when the power failed, 
the hotel was plunged into inky darkness and a frantic search ensued behind the 
bar for candles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Skies Cleared 
</P>
<P>
One candle-lit dinner later, I went to bed. The first day had been a memorable 
one, but I had yet to see the full grandeur of the falls and I had only two 
days left. 
</P>
<P>
By the next morning the skies had cleared. I learned later that 4 1/2 inches of 
rain had fallen in four hours the night before. After grabbing a quick 
breakfast of paw-paw (a larger version of papaya), sliced cheese and orange 
juice on the terrace, I set off through the bush, bypassing the 
tourist-trappers already setting out their wares along the pathway. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing to cut through the bush was perhaps not the wisest decision. One of my 
guidebooks had warned: " . . . keep to clearly marked footpaths when walking in 
the bush, or, if this is not possible, wear protective socks and boots." 
</P>
<P>
I was wearing thongs and a pair of shorts, and hoped that the guidebook's 
author was correct when she said: "Bites from animals other than insects are so 
rare as to be hardly worthy of mention." 
</P>
<P>
I took my time, stayed silent and kept my eyes open. My reward was the close-up 
sight of a large bushbuck doe that I startled when rounding an outcrop of rock; 
the view of a bristly group of wart hogs rooting in a mudhole, and, in a moment 
of near panic, something tawny that I fervently hoped was not a lion, hyena or 
any other kind of cat, breaking through the brush 100 feet to my right. 
</P>
<P>
The guidebook was not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, leopard and even lion have been seen, and elephant and buffalo 
often wander into the outskirts of the town during the dry season," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful. I hadn't seen another soul in almost an hour, was God-knows-where in 
the middle of the bush, and something was out there. Perhaps the rain the day 
before meant that this was now the wet season and the lions would be elsewhere. 
Anywhere elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I quickened my pace, saw a wooden building that turned out to be a Zimbabwe 
border post, then crossed the railway line that leads from Victoria Falls to 
the town of Livingstone on the Zambian side of the border. Within minutes I was 
back at the falls. 
</P>
<P>
Writers, artists and photographers have tried for more than a century to do the 
waterfall justice. A few, like English artist Thomas Baines, have succeeded. 
Reproductions of Baines' superb oil paintings (the originals are in the South 
African Library in Cape Town) line the hotel walls, but the real thing is even 
more eye-opening. 
</P>

"On sights as beautiful as this, angels in their flight must have gazed," was 
the rather soppy phrase Livingstone used. Well, he was a missionary, not a 
writer, and he did do slightly better later: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sheet of Driven Snow' 
</P>
<P>
"Into this chasm, of twice the depth of Niagara Falls, the river, a full mile 
wide, rolls with a deafening roar. . . . The whole body of water rolls clear 
over, quite unbroken. But after a descent of 10 or more feet, the entire mass 
suddenly becomes like a huge sheet of driven snow. Pieces of water leap off it 
in the form of comets with tails streaming behind, till the whole snowy sheet 
becomes myriads of rushing, leaping, aqueous comets." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best aspect of Victoria Falls today is that more than 133 years 
after Livingstone's visit the area remains virtually unspoiled. Bush, river and 
waterfall are much as they have always been. Certainly, the animals are fewer 
and farther between, but no hideous commercialism has encroached. There are not 
even any guardrails to protect the unwary from a 400-foot plunge to the rocks 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, however, the superstitions that once surrounded Mosi-oa-Tunya seem to 
have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
French missionary Francois Coillard, who visited the falls 20 years after 
Livingstone, said that the natives "believe it is haunted by a malevolent and 
cruel divinity and they make offerings to conciliate its favor -- bead 
necklaces, a bracelet or some other object which they fling into the abyss, 
bursting into lugubrious incantations, quite in harmony with their dread and 
horror." 
</P>
<P>
No malevolent spirit was hanging about this morning. The sky was a deep blue, 
the sun hot on my back as I walked the length of the falls and back again. Each 
bend in the path offered something new: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Livingstone Memorial with its inscription that history has since made 
obsolete: "On the occasion of the centenary of David Livingstone's discovery of 
the Victoria Falls, men and women of all races in and from all parts of the 
federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland assembled solemnly to dedicate themselves 
and their country to carry on the high Christian aims and ideals which inspired 
David Livingstone in his mission here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
150 Million Years 
</P>
<P>
Rhodesia and Nyasaland are long gone, but as the Zimbabwe Tourist Board 
advertisement so effectively states, Victoria Falls remains, "Now in Its 150 
Millionth Fantastic Year. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rain Forest, where an umbrella is the best defense, no matter how 
cloudless the sky, against the unending showers of spray that rise and then 
rain down from the adjacent falls. 
</P>
<P>
"The morning sun gilds these columns of watery smoke with all the glowing 
colors of double or treble rainbows," Livingstone wrote. "The evening sun, from 
a hot yellow sky, imparts a sulfurous hue and gives one the impression that the 
yawning gulf might resemble the mouth of the bottomless pit. No bird sits and 
sings on the branches of the grove of perpetual showers, or ever builds its 
nest there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The succession of views that defy description: the Devil's Cataract, the 
Main Falls, Horseshoe Falls, Rainbow Falls, Livingstone Island, Danger Point, 
the Knife Edge, Boiling Pot Gorge, the Whirlpool. Each name carries with it a 
lasting image. 
</P>
<P>
The drought, which had lasted eight months, had left the Zambesi low. Rock 
showed everywhere along the fall line, and I even noticed some youngsters, 
carrying what looked like handmade fishing poles, wading from island to island 
on what seemed the very lip of the falls. 
</P>
<P>
It still flowed with an impressive volume of water, though, enough for several 
teams of white-water fans to be launching their rafts near the Boiling Pot 
after scrambling down a cliff face on the Zambian side. From 400 feet above, 
they looked like toy figures as they went through their preparations before 
being swept out of view through the gorges. 
</P>
<P>
The Zambesi flows for 800 miles before reaching the falls, then has another 900 
miles to go before emptying into the Indian Ocean. In a few months the river 
would be at flood stage, with an unimaginable average of 120 million gallons of 
water pouring over the falls each minute. Then the spray reaches 1,200 feet 
high and one can hear the crash and roar of the plunging water 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Like other visitors before and since, I stood entranced, caught in the grip of 
the river's spell. Before I knew it, the day had gone. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the hotel, I celebrated with dinner in the Livingstone Room. Even then, 
the river would not let go. I ordered crocodile. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Zambesi?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Zambesi," the waiter replied. 
</P>
<P>
Like Victoria Falls, it was indescribable.

THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: MEMORIES, MYTHS AND MIDRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SHANNON, Shannon's recent books include Sea Gifts (Godine) and the 
critical study Arnold Lobel (Twayne). 
</P>

While memory is the universal weft of story, not all memories have the kernel 
of universality essential to create a good story. In Thunder Cake (Philomel: 
$14.95; 32 pp.; ages 4-8), Patricia Polacco succeeds, recalling a childhood 
fear that will be familiar to many of us. One day when thunder began crackling 
ominously from afar, Polacco's immigrant grandmother asked her to hastily 
gather ingredients from around the farm for a "thunder cake." By the time the 
storm loomed directly overhead, Polacco was celebrating her new-found bravery 
with cake and tea from the samovar. 
</P>
<P>
Though Polacco's narrative is self-conscious at times, it advances swiftly with 
a balance of humor and tension. As the text focuses on a little girl's fears, 
the illustrations celebrate the uniqueness of the grandmother's heritage. 
Evoking the textures and styles of traditional Russian clothing and 
knickknacks, they are no doubt drawn from the images that filled Polacco's eyes 
as a child. An informality of both line and action further contributes to the 
book's sense of warmth and immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
The story of childhood is one of energy, discovery and a growing sense of self. 
Few children's books recount this better than "A Hole Is to Dig" and its 
companion, the Open House for Butterflies, both by Ruth Krauss and Maurice 
Sendak. The latter, recently reprinted (Harper &amp; Row: $10.95; 48 pp.; ages 
4-8), asks one of the many children who act out stories and play with words in 
these pages: "If you went out and forgot your pretend friends, where would you 
go when you went back for them?" And another: "If you run out of cereal, can 
you run into it again?" 
</P>
<P>
Giving body and breadth to these young voices, Sendak's pen-and-ink 
illustrations evoke the spontaneous choreography of children at play. Together, 
Krauss and Sendak have created a lasting celebration of childhood's importance. 
Or, as one child puts it: "A baby makes the mother and father -- otherwise 
they're just plain people." 
</P>
<P>
A Long Hard Journey: The Story of the Pullman Porter (Walker: $17.95; 144 pp.; 
ages 10-14) stretches through U.S. history like the railroad itself, connecting 
faraway places and times. After the Civil War, Pullman cars provided 
respectable employment for many African Americans. But good news faded to bad 
as work conditions worsened and pay became insulting. In 1934, prospects began 
to brighten when the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters became the first 
all-black union to join the American Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of the Pullman Porter" is a complex one, covering a great deal of 
time and intense emotions, but Patricia and Frederick McKissack keep their 
narrative honest, understanding the dignities and fallibilities of the porters. 
Sometimes good people make poor decisions, they write, and good decisions 
become mistakes as social circumstances change. 
</P>
<P>
Strength of story also enriches Barbara Bash's scientific narrative, Tree of 
Life: The World of the African Baobab (Sierra Club Books: $14.95; 32 pp.; 
grades 1-5). As the tale opens, a group of African bushmen point toward an old 
tree, explaining that its branches became gnarled and knotted because a 
careless hyena planted it upside down. In every stage of its yearly cycle, the 
baobab tree gives life to different species in different ways. Leafless, it is 
home to chameleons and snakes. Birds arrive when the rains bring leaves. Bush- 
baby monkeys and bats drink the nectar of its blossoms, and impalas eat the 
same flowers once they fall to the ground. Baboon and man enjoy the fruit that 
follows. For man, the baobab holds honey and medicines as well. 
</P>
<P>
By following the overlapping cycles of these species, Bash creates a narrative 
that echoes the enduring rhythm of the tree itself. From the hush of her color 
illustrations to her text in calligraphy, Bash's thoughtful observations have 
transformed the facts of the amazing baobab into an involving tale of life. 
</P>
<P>
As the title story of Marc Gellman's Does God Have a Big Toe? (Harper &amp; 
Row: $16.70; 90 pp.; all ages) explains, our desire to question the unknown is 
as constant as the impossibility of finding pat answers. One solution to the 
paradox is to celebrate the questions themselves with more questions! 
Acknowledging the impossibility of explaining what various Bible stories mean, 
Gellman widens them with 21 new tales about the stories, called Midrash. At 
once funny and tender, all 21 resonate with fresh awareness, encouraging 
readers to search for their own insights. 
</P>
<P>
Some stories bounce with fresh twists. The parting of the Red Sea, for example, 
is experienced from the point of view of startled fish. Other tales are retold 
from the perspective of any suburban kid. Beginning the story of Babel, Gellman 
writes, "Every person spoke the same language. All of which made life very 
easy. Getting the news was easy, and you didn't have to learn a new language in 
high school." The playfulness and renewed innocence of these stories are 
beautifully extended by Oscar deMejo's naive paintings. Rich for reading aloud 
and savoring alone, "Does God Have a Big Toe?" is an intriguing delight.

<HEAD>Book Says Onassis Plotted Nude Photos of Jackie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aristotle Onassis plotted with photographers to
publish candid, nude photographs of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis so
she would stop complaining about tamer shots taken by papparazzi,
according to a new book.
   ``He figured if she appeared in the nude, nothing else they did
could ever offend her again,'' the late lawyer Roy Cohn is quoted
as saying in ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' an upcoming unauthorized
biography of the former first lady written by C. David Heymann. It
is being serialized in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid.
   The photographs of Mrs. Onassis sunbathing on Skorpios, the
Greek island where she married Onassis in 1968, were taken by 10
photographers using telephoto lenses and underwater cameras and
appeared in magazines around the world.
   Nancy Tuckerman, spokeswoman for Mrs. Onassis, said when the
first part of the series appeared last week that the former first
lady would have no comment.
   The book also detailed Mrs. Onassis' lavish spending sprees and
said that the question of money came up at the funeral of Onassis,
who died on March 15, 1975, the Star reports in its Monday edition.
   Mrs. Onassis' brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who earlier
had negotiated her prenuptial contract with Onassis, rode in the
funeral limousine with her and Christina Onassis, Aristotle's
daughter.
   Christina Onassis, who has since died, told Heymann in a brief
interview that Kennedy turned to her in the limousine and said,
``Now, it's time to take care of Jackie.''
   ``It seemed almost inconceivable that Ted Kennedy would choose
that moment to discuss financial matters,'' said Christina Onassis.
``But it was Jackie's hyena-like smile that drove me from the car.
She was like a hungry vulture waiting to feast on my father's
flesh.''
   Book sales begin May 2. The New York Daily News, Cosmopolitan,
New Woman and McCall's have second serialization rights.

<TEXT>     Kathryn Roszak's "Puer Aeternus" ("Eternal Child") was presented by the
Goethe-Institut of German culture, presumably because it's based on a story by
Thomas Mann and features a song, "Das Veilchen" ("The Violet"), to a poem of
Goethe.;    The unoriginal premise of this 20-minute mishmash is that Mozart's
timeless music can make performers forget their egos and impresarios the box
office take. No argument here.;    The very mixed talent pool includes four
lovely girls from San Francisco Ballet's school and two really bad actors.
Mozart is a marionette handled by two inept puppeteers. Also present is San
Francisco Opera soprano Maria Fortuna, whose gorgeous voice shines in the song
and an aria from "Zaide.";    Over at 1800 Sq. Feet, an erstwhile garage used
by the High Risk Group, there's "Warehouse Mozart," a program of odd,
bumptious, sometimes amusing but mostly insulting stuff.;    A pair of mimes
called Circus Absurdus bumbles through "Sonata for Violin and Music Stand."
Craig Landry swishes around in "Moe," hopping over four plaster busts of
Mozart. An alleged trapeze artist and even more alleged singer, Julie Queen,
perches on a swing in her undies and warbles the songs of the Queen of the
Night (get it?) from "The Magic Flute.";    Rick Darnell of High Risk, whose
group dances almost exclusively about the overriding concern of the gay
community, ran essentially the same material on the AIDS epidemic through a
Mozartian sieve (bits of the Requiem, no less) and called it "Ho-Mozart.";   
In this politically correct work, Christine Carraher pinned toys standing for
Mozart's life and times (a doll, an inflatable globe) to a clothesline and
found commonalities therein: "Mozart and I were both born into white
supremacist empires.";    Carraher can dance, but hardly so in this
constricted space. Of the 1,800 square feet, only about 50 are usable for
dancing when more than 80 people are crammed into a space that seats 60.;   
Performance artist Hank Hyena was the night's saving grace. "The way to
understand a culture is by examining its underwear," he said. (No argument
here, either.) In his "Austrian Undergarments of the 18th Century," an array
of corsets, bustiers, panniers, falsies and chastity belts was modeled by such
well-endowed hunks as Lewdwig and Captain Codpiece.;  Puer Aeternus; By

MUSTY MATERIAL FAILS TO PROP UP COMIC BRUCE BAUM AT TOP SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The knock on Bruce Baum has always been his reliance on props, that he can't 
float a show without those buoys of low humor. 
</P>
<P>
As is his way, Baum propped himself up throughout his 45-minute performance at 
the Hyatt Regency Alicante's Top Secret Comedy Club Friday night, pulling out 
one visual exclamation point after another. 
</P>
<P>
He donned his wacky rock band glasses (Kiss had to be the inspiration), he 
displayed his drawing of bearded sperm, he twisted his rubber record, he 
twirled his inflatable globe, he turned on his cymbal-playing monkey, he . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's Baum's style, and you expect it. What was off-putting Friday was how old 
all these sight gags are. Baum's been using the same props for a while now, 
many reflecting a dated point of view. He needs to visit the toy store again. 
</P>
<P>
Baum should also update much of his verbal material. Several times he used 
jokes linked to impressions that have long evaporated in the public mind. Like 
when he did a prop-heavy, staccato interpretation of a few music videos, most 
from the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
All were pretty forgettable back then, and it wasn't surprising that some 
didn't register as Baum frantically tried to find a satiric tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he brought up that stale Coors commercial featuring Mark Harmon 
standing in a stream. Baum reminded the audience that the actor makes this big 
point about how Coors uses only the finest water. But Baum is thinking, "Hey, 
get your feet out of my beer!" 
</P>
<P>
Never a great joke, but it probably was reasonable when the ad's imagery was 
fresh a few years ago. What about all the current commercials worth bruising? 
</P>
<P>
In defense of Baum, the small crowd at this small club did seem charmed by his 
performance. Most apparently were familiar with his career (a few murmured the 
punch lines a beat before Baum delivered them) and may have seen this as a live 
reel of the comic's greatest hits. A passel of gags did go back to the late 
'70s, when Baum started performing stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
And there was something pleasantly nostalgic about his bit on '60s "alternative 
theater," where he assumed a very cool, very serious persona, lit his face with 
a flashlight, and dealt in a little nihilistic poetry babble. 
</P>
<P>
That was weird, and it worked. Baum's best moments surfaced after he slipped 
into a bizarre mode, with a timeless orientation minus the props. Like his 
reflections on going to the dentist: it's not the pain of the drill that 
bothers him, but "when the drill gets stuck and the dentist spins around and 
around." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the zoo is unnerving: Why do they always put the paranoid animals 
next to the cages with the hyenas and mockingbirds? 
</P>
<P>
All this talk about rap music also got him thinking. Blacks didn't invent it, 
whites did, but they call it "square dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, these were brief flourishes in an otherwise creaky dance. Baum, a comic 
who has shown he knows the steps, should look for some new partners.

PHOTOGRAPHY: AFRICAN SAFARIS CHALLENGE THE ABILITY TO PREPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost everyone likes to take photographs of animals, but after awhile they do 
start to look the same. After all, how many pictures can you get of a bear 
waving as the tour bus goes by? 
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, you may be ready for the next plateau -- an African 
safari. 
</P>
<P>
The price -- $2,500 to $4,000 -- may be an obstacle for most, but the adventure 
behind it is certainly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Those who decide to take an African safari should know that shooting Kodachrome 
slides of elephants and lions in their natural habitats can't be done well 
without proper advance planning and research. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think that going to Africa is like going to the San Diego Zoo," 
said Bob Greenburg, a nature photographer and Newport Beach 
obstetrician-gynecologist who is planning his fifth trip to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally a misconception because wild animals are unique. They are alert, 
alive, they have personality, they look at you and they interact with you. 
Animals that are in a zoo, like any captive creature, have their spirit broken 
and are nervous and circle their cages. 
</P>
<P>
"African animals in the wild have to be alert because if they're not, they're 
lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of Greenburg's recommendations for a successful safari: 
</P>
<P>
Selecting a tour -- The best tour operator is one who comes recommended by a 
friend or someone that has been on a recent safari. Don't be misled by 
brochures making grandiose claims. Some of the better operators may be a little 
more expensive, but the extra money will probably greatly increase your 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
You should find out how many people will be in each van. The tour companies 
usually have mini-vans that seat nine people, which, with luggage, can be a 
tight fit. The maximum should be four or five. 
</P>
<P>
Professional photographers leading the tour -- If there is a professional 
photographer leading the trip, check his or her references. You will be paying 
for his trip to Africa, so he can take photographs to fill his stock files. Be 
sure the references are from a recent trip. Ask if the photographer caters to 
both beginning and advanced shooters. The photographer should help you with 
your pictures so when you come home the results are worthy of your investment 
in the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment -- For the average traveler, Greenburg recommends a wide-angle lens, 
28- or 35-millimeter up to a telephoto lens of 300-mm. at the minimum. For 
animal photography, a 400-mm. lens is best. 
</P>
<P>
A bean bag or a Steady Bag is a great way of steadying the camera and lens on 
the van. Trying to use a tripod while shooting through the roof of the van 
becomes awkward. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't wish to carry a Steady Bag should take an empty bean bag with 
them and at the first market fill it with dried rice, beans or peas and use it 
as a camera support. After the safari give the rice or beans to your driver. 
Food is very expensive and will be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Always take an extra camera body along. The African dust can ruin the moving 
parts of your camera. 
</P>
<P>
Film -- Double the amount of film you originally plan to take. Greenburg shoots 
mostly Kodak's Kodachrome 64-slide film. He also shoots a lesser amount of 
Kodachrome 200 for low-light situations. He takes the film out of the box, puts 
it into a sealed plastic bag and has it hand-examined at the airports, making 
sure it is not put through X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to pace yourself. A rule of thumb is four rolls of 36 exposures 
a day when shooting in the national parks. Greenburg says he has shot up to 25 
rolls in one day at a lodge where a herd of elephants was approaching the water 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations -- Tour operators offer accommodations ranging from very nice 
lodges at the national parks with all the comforts to tents. 
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes -- They are probably the only insects you'll have to worry about. 
Most of the camps and lodges at night provide mosquito protection and spray the 
rooms at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
Medicine -- Greenburg recommends taking protective products for the eyes and 
lips. You may also need medication for sore throats, sunburn and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations -- Reservations should be made at least six months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Mornings -- You usually wake up at 5:30 a.m. and have coffee at 6 a.m. You then 
drive to the game preserves until 8:30 a.m., stopping when you see animals. 
</P>
<P>
The Safari -- In game parks it's a law that you have to stay in the vans. 
Animals view you as no threat when you're in a van. The drivers are specially 
trained for these situations. Some of the game lodges offer bunkers or verandas 
from which to shoot. They can give you a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting Photographs -- The experience of shooting pictures is phenomenal. It's 
an unbelievable feeling when you look through your camera at a lion roaring in 
your face. Using a fast shutter speed such as 1/250 or faster can greatly 
improve your nature shots. Also try to shoot a highlight in the animal's eye, 
which can make a photograph come to life. Without this, the animal might as 
well be stuffed in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Also drape a focusing cloth over your head and the camera to enhance your 
ability to focus accurately in the bright sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Don't overextend yourself, because fatigue can make you rush your photographs 
and cause you to get careless with focus and composition. Select a tour with 
fewer parks so you'll be able to get more detail at each stop. Remember, 
patience is a virtue while on safari. 
</P>
<P>
Natives -- Try to establish a rapport with people you want to photograph. 
Introduce yourself and ask their names. Don't just stick a camera in their face 
and start snapping. Many times the natives will ask to have a photograph sent 
back to them. Rarely do people ever keep their promise. So, Greenburg takes 
along a Polaroid camera and just gives them that picture. 
</P>
<P>
Music -- Most of the gift shops at the lodges sell recorded music of the local 
tribes. Consider buying a cassette for background music for your slide show 
when you return. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations -- Greenburg's favorite park is Mountain Lodge at Mount Kenya 
National Park in Kenya. It's an opportunity to be in a beautiful rustic 
building overlooking a water hole and salt lick. 
</P>
<P>
It has an underground viewing bunker or you can shoot from the balcony of your 
room or the roof of the hotel. It also has some rarely seen animals such as 
bush pigs and giant forest hogs in addition to elephants, cape buffalo, 
antelope and gazelles. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite is the Mara Serena Lodge at Masai Mara National Park in Kenya. 
It was built as a replica of a Masai tribe's village, but with all the 
amenities of a resort.

LIFE IN A BLEAK POST-CIVILIZED WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Better Get Your Angel On by Jennifer Allen (Alfred Knopf: $16.95; 112 pages) 
</P>
<P>
If you stripped away everything that makes contemporary life faintly tolerable, 
you'd be left with the world according to Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Though she's heralded as a scribe of the "post-verbal" culture, the state she 
describes is eerily reminiscent of the prehistoric society so succinctly 
defined by Thomas Hobbes: "No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst 
of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, 
solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." 
</P>
<P>
There's one depressingly crucial difference. The bleak conditions Hobbes 
described eventually improved, but once you're "post-civilized," there's 
nowhere to go but down and out. Though Allen, as a "post-verbal" writer, is not 
geographically as specific as she might be, a close reader can easily deduce 
that most of these horrific tales are set in California. We're already here, in 
the eye of the apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
All vestiges of love, law and morality are gone, replaced by hatred, violence 
and mindless lust. Taking this unpromising detritus, the author succeeds in 
giving us a vision of the immediate future, one so unnervingly close to present 
reality that the old reliable tranquilizer -- "It's only a story" -- doesn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, these aren't stories in the ordinary sense, but mere moments in 
time and space -- structureless and all but characterless, though the 
environment is all too familiar -- the beach, a motel, the freeway, a housing 
project. Allen creates her fiction out of found incidents much the way the 
Dadaists made art from found objects, but while they were only teasing the 
public, Allen is warning us that this is the way life is going to be from now 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Because her actors have all but lost the knack of intelligible speech, the 
direction is not immediately apparent. Even so, you get the drift, or perhaps 
undertow is the better word. 
</P>
<P>
In a grimly sardonic piece called "Dinner," a monstrous family of three boys, a 
mother and father are having a meal. The father wants everyone to say grace, 
which in this context is as unimaginable as expecting a hyena to mind a baby. 
One son sucks the blood off the strings tying the roast, another drinks blood, 
a third breaks the furniture. The father hits the kids, curses, and threatens, 
while the mother endures, saying at the end, "Grace is over," not only the 
understatement of the decade but a concise summary of the content of the whole 
book. 
</P>
<P>
In "Her Name Is Wahoo," the title character is a dog and the narrator "a hoser 
of pens at the pet kennel." Man and dog live in a subdivision so raw that 
coyotes steal infants. Instead of names, the residents are known by the 
position of their houses -- "the first house on the left." If you've been 
looking for an effective dehumanization metaphor, your search is over. 
</P>
<P>
Tough customers can proceed to "Chlorine," in which one character has a 
crucifix stuck in his nose and other is called Skate-Rat Lance. The whole gang 
is "spaced out to the max," enjoying a small-scale race war on the cement-sided 
river bank where they roller-skate. What Allen's publisher calls "a linguistic 
evolution in the very first stages of staking its historical claim" is not only 
evident here, but already in full flower. 
</P>
<P>
These are all worst-case scenarios, written to be perceived rather than 
described. We're dealing here with hyper-reality, and it's not for the 
squeamish. Endowed with perfect pitch for the speech of her humanoids, 
exploiting a macabre and antic imagination, Allen's 13 projections not only 
explore the depths of modern life but wallow in them. You join the fun at your 
peril.

<LEADPARA>  MOZART lived during the Enlightenment, when it was expected of gentlefolk that
they be conversant with all the arts, from philosophy to politics, and to be
accomplished performers of salon entertainment, from dramatic tableaux to
keyboard duets.;    So it's appropriate that "Mozart &amp; His Time" include a
healthy assortment of other events, both traditional and outrageous,
celebrating the achievements of this most prolific and elegant of composers.
Here are highlights from the dance, theater, film and hard-to-classify
offerings:  </LEADPARA>

men's issues, is somewhat more sober, performing dances and songs based on the

By BILL BOLTE, Bill Bolte is writer and a disabled-rights activist in Culver 
City.Even in our state Legislature, a guy in a wheelchair can't find a properly 
equipped bathroom. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My intention was to observe a Sacramento protest demonstration by my fellow 
disabled people against the recent Deukmejian budget proposal. I had driven all 
night from Los Angeles to keep the heat from further disabling me and my aging 
van. I found a blue-curb spot outside the Capitol, dropped the wheelchair lift 
and headed for some breakfast in the cafeteria in the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Israel of the State Police confided to me in the rotunda that the 
disabled had demonstrated every week for the last three weeks -- about 40 the 
first two weeks and about 80 the week before. "They're all very nice. We just 
push their wheelchairs out and they don't resist." He paused, then added, 
"Nothing like the farm workers. When they came, they really tore up the place." 
</P>
<P>
Soon I was ready to tear up the place myself. 
</P>
<P>
All a wanted to do was use a toilet. But many years after the passage of access 
laws, and after an enormously expensive renovation of the Capitol, the only 
thing changed was that the doors were wide enough to get in with a wheelchair. 
The pressure needed to open the door was just as vault-like as in the old days, 
though regulations had long called for a two-thirds reduction. The mirror, 
dispensers, sinks -- and most important, the toilets -- were at traditional 
levels. As I transferred from my wheelchair to the toilet seat, I knew I was in 
for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The legal regulations call for handicapped toilets 19 inches high -- level with 
most wheelchair seats. Additionally, many of us use heavy, sophisticated 
cushions to prevent pressure sores, adding to the wheelchair height. These 
Capitol toilet seats were less than 14 inches high. Supercrip Mark Wellman may 
climb El Capitan with his arms, but many of us power-wheelchair users do not 
have the strength to raise ourselves five inches up and then swing to the side. 
I was trapped. I could not get off the toilet seat. 
</P>
<P>
I struggled. I tried every angle, every leverage point. I wanted to tear out 
those bars supposedly installed to help the disabled. They hemmed me in and 
kept me from getting the angle I needed. They were installed at the standard 
height for a high toilet seat. Only a double-jointed hyena could use the bars 
to help here. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, dripping with sweat, I began dismantling my wheelchair. I carefully 
removed the arm with the power control, laying it on the floor. I removed the 
pedals. I removed the heavy cushion and propped it against the wall. I put the 
brakes on. 
</P>
<P>
A final effort got one cheek on the seat of the wheelchair. Reassembling the 
chair and getting the cushion under me involved another herculean effort. 
</P>
<P>
As I washed my hands, wiping the sweat from the face I could barely see in the 
high mirror, I wondered when genuine, material, equal opportunity would arrive 
for the millions of disabled people who are manufactured each year in our 
factories and on our highways, shot in our slums, overdosed in our suburbs, or 
simply invaded by the wrong virus. Here in the Capitol of the state alleged to 
be the leader in progress for the disabled, a disabled person still cannot go 
to the toilet without contortionist efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as I watched the sweating handful of California's disabled gather to 
protest funding cuts proposed by the governor, I couldn't help questioning the 
focus of the demonstration leaders. They were trying to save a group of 
independent-living centers designed to serve the disabled. As worthy as these 
agencies may be -- and their effectiveness is profoundly questioned by many 
disabled -- the money at issue is a piddling $5 million out of cuts of 
thousands of millions. With such narrow, self-serving leadership, is it any 
wonder that the Capitol toilets are still unusable by many disabled people, 
decades after regulations requiring access? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe what the disabled need is a militant union and a leader from among them 
like Cesar Chavez. I hear that before he came alog, farm workers, too, didn't 
have toilets to use when they were out working in the field. 
</P>
<P>
That night, as I headed west in search of a cool place to sleep in the van, I 
couldn't help but wonder at how little had changed in California. The governor 
and Legislature seem to be once again in the hands of the robber barons. Even 
the initiative process introduced by the reformer Hiram Johnson seems to be in 
their grasp. And here I was, just trying to find a cool Target or K-Mart 
parking lot where the cops wouldn't hassle me for sleeping in a 10-year-old van 
with 105,000 miles on it.

EDINBURGH FIM FESTIVAL: BEST YOUNG FILM-MAKERS
LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS (PG)

HOT SHOTS] PART DEUX (12)

LAKE CONSEQUENCE (18)

Hombres y mujeres, gather round the campfire. This week's story is 'El
Mariachi' and it is a cracker. Once in Mexico there was a handsome
travelling guitarist, or mariachi-player, who carried his instrument inside
a big black case. But one day a gangster's contract was put out on a
fugitive killer carrying an arsenal of guns concealed in - yes] - a
near-identical big black case.
You see the opportunities for comical-dramatical confusion? Simple but
inspired. And imagine them enacted in a movie. Woofling-whistling music
after Ennio Morricone; lunging visuals a la Sergio Leone; screen wide as a
water-melon slice; a girl; a town; a lot of chases; a crowning gunfight.
Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi touched its lighted cigar to festival fuses
this year and blew several happy audiences, including mine at Berlin, right
out of their seats. As often in cinema - see Metropolis, Casablanca,
L'Avventura, Airplane] - the most ridiculous plots are the most inspired.
Here we have mistaken identity to the power of infinity, as a simple mix-up
between black-suited itinerants becomes something like a Feydeau farce
played out in a Spaghetti Western set.
The timing does it. Who expects madness to be paced and choreographed like a
ballet? But from the first moody swagger into the first wide-angle bar; from
the first hair-raising zoom into the knuckle-cracking finger-flexing of a
harmonica player; from the first stomach-lurching camera movement that
challenges gravity and a heavy breakfast; from the first proof that the
sultry heroine means sado-sexual business ('Sing]' she hisses to the hero,
holding a knife to a sensitive body part as he sits in his bath); from the
first striking of the villain's match on his henchman's chin stubble; from
all this to the drop-dead grace and perfection of the showdown El Mariachi
is as major a delight as a minor film can be.
Made in Mexico by a first-time American director on a joke budget (Dollars
7000), it shows what human enterprise can do when tinged with judicious
insanity. (Rodriguez raised the money by hiring himself out as a guinea pig
for a drugs trial. Young film-makers, do not practise this at home.) The
movie has no content but more than enough style to make up the deficiency.
*****
The Edinburgh Film Festival, just begun, boasts El Mariachi plus Derek
Jarman's Blue (reviewed by me last week, announced for a London opening next
week) plus a serviceable blend of the past year's festival successes and
world or UK premieres.
These include Anthony Minghella's Mr Wonderful, John Sayles's Passion Fish,
Ken Loach's Raining Stones, Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden and the
customary egg-and-spoon race between young unknowns for the prize of Best
Young Film-Maker. The seniors mentioned have all produced modest work or
work already noted at other cine-sprees, so let us forget about them until
they reach public cinemas.
The youngsters, pitching apprentice shorts and non-features into the
Edinburgh pot, are a more intriguing mix of the craftsmanlike-conventional
with the wild and interesting.
Nicole Mitchell's Spring Belle (fly-on-wall fresco of a Sydney 'Come
Dancing' junket), Jon Camoy's Dinner With Malibu (teenage boy spies on Dad's
girlfriends) and Don McKellar's Blue (no relation to Jarman's film, but
starring rival movie-maker David Cronenberg as a porn-obsessed office boss)
are wry short stories on film: teasers well-lensed if a little tame in their
teasing.
Alexis Bisticas' The Clearing is stranger and more haunting: a camera's-view
saunter through a woodland where nice and naughty actions are glimpsed and
where a lonely saxophone sound leads on like Jack O' Lantern. Finally the
camera does a cut and about-turn and we see and recognise the walker's
famous face: that radiant, runic old phiz shining with secret knowledge and
transcendent questions. (To identify, think of the person we've referred to
most in these paragraphs).
But the best of the young movies is Dan Geva's Jerusalem: Rhythms Of A
Distant City. This handheld portrait of a waking town - Geva's hungry,
headlong camera devours everything from the morning's fresh loaves to the
first wailers at Jerusalem's Wall - is a mini-tribute to Ruttman's classic
documentary Berlin, Symphony Of A City and a knockout in its own right.
Kinetic technique matches kinetic vision: a pantherish pantheism leaping on
every detail small or large to celebrate the marvel of living and the even
greater marvel (in a city) of living together.
*****
Fifty years ago this week filming began on Les Enfants Du Paradis. Half a
century later, we are still marvelling. Back in a new print is the film the
French Academy once voted the country's best of all time: three hours of
romance, epigram and superfine melodrama set among theatre folk in 19th
century Paris. Lines crackle; faces glow or glower above the wing collars.
Pierre Brasseur's leonine actor, Marcel Herrand's preening
playwright/murderer, Jean-Louis Barrault's ice-featured mime (resembling
Kenneth Williams re-sculpted by Bernini) and Arletty's beauty of the
boulevard du crime, the melting-eyed Garance . . . Four-to-umpteen
characters caught up in a time of French history as troubled as that in
which the movie was made.
This may be the least filmic of all great films. Jacques Prevert's script,
Marcel Carnes direction, Alexandre Trauner's sets, conjured from the moral
and political rubble of Occupied France, are elegant, paperweight constructs
that sheer will and passion seem to have made monumental. The truth-based
main characters - only Garance had no historical forebear - step in and out
of their professional fictions no less surreally, but far more magically,
than A. Schwarzenegger did in Last Action Hero. And as in Olivier's
almost-contemporary Henry V, theatre is both matrix and metaphor for the
dramatic switchbackings that flow from it. A wonder; and at 50 younger than
ever.
*****
The rest of the week consists of a bad spoof and a worse skin-flick. Hot
Shots] Part Deux is a worthy sequel to Hot Shots] Part Un: 90 minutes of
legalised gag starvation with Charlie Sheen as our gung-ho hero, here
changed from trainee top-gunner to Rambo clone. He sports Stallone-style
hair and Stallone-style muscles. (Do these Hollywood stars go to a gym or
plug themselves into a giant bicycle pump?). And he has an urge to topple
Saddam Hussein (Jerry Haleva).
Saddam, of course, steals the show. Lighting his cigar with a desktop oil
derrick, hand-hoovering crumbs from his silk pajama trousers, raiding his
fridge for Camel Milk or Yankee Dog Burgers, he is a pantomime villain
turned politically-incorrect pratfaller. He is also the only funny thing for
miles around. Elsewhere, the jokes drop like stones; and the long, middle,
Saddamless section could be laughed at only by paid hyenas trained by 20th
Century Fox. I thought I heard some of these at the Press show.
Lake Consequence is funnier, though not by intention. From the stable of
executive producer Zalman King (9 1/2 Weeks, Full Moon Junction) comes
another high-faluting essay in soft porn, this one telling the story of the
Housewife (Joan Severance) and the Tree-pruner (Billy Zane). She fancies
him; he fancies her; off she goes, accidentally abducted when his trailer
moves off with her still in it.
They end up in Lake Consequence, wherever that is. Lots of Jacuzzis. Lots of
percussion and snare-drums on the soundtrack. (It sounds like a blue movie
filmed at the Peking Opera). And lots of Mount Rushmore-style sex, where
giant close-ups mean you cannot tell a nose from a thighbone, a pair of
breasts from a full moon junction. To enhance vision (if you could possibly
be interested), take a pair of binoculars and stare through the wrong end.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: Swaying across the shimmering plains - African
elephants are reputed to be impossible to train. But three of them carried
Michael J Woods through the Okavango Delta - on their terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX WHITE, black and tan wild dogs, the rarest and most endangered of
Africa's carnivores, reluctantly rose to their feet and disdainfully stepped
aside as we pushed into the thick thorn scrub where they were resting in the
heat of the day.
For the first time in my life I felt quite invisible, my universally feared
human form subsumed into that of the African elephant on which I was riding,
for the dogs had no inkling of our presence. All they noticed were the great
grey ghosts padding almost silently past. This magic was to be repeated
again and again during our safari. For almost a week, I became an elephant.
Even giraffes with small calves and notoriously grumpy lone bull buffaloes
allowed us to come much closer than I had believed possible.
Sadly, the only animals it was necessary to avoid were wild elephants and we
had more than our fair share of encounters during our five-day elephant-back
safari from Abu's camp, run by Ker and Downey in Botswana's Okavango Delta.
Generally speaking, distant animals would be easily deterred by the sight of
Randall Moore, the owner of the three riding elephants, Abu, Bennie and
Kathy. He accompanied us on foot and was armed in case of problems. Twice,
though, we were followed. On the first occasion a troubled Kathy repeatedly
sent deep, rumbling growls far into the forest from her vibrating body; on
the second, it needed two shots, fired over the head of a persistent bull,
before he would retreat.
Each of the three adult elephants carried two passengers on its back,
sitting in a mixture of saddle and play-pen with the handler or mahout
riding astride the elephant's neck. From here the animals were controlled
with verbal commands, prods from the bull hook and rewards of cattle nuts.
African elephants are reputed to be impossible to train, being larger and
supposedly of more uncertain temperament than their Indian counterparts.
While Randall Moore has proved this to be a fallacy, I always felt our trip
was conducted on the elephants' terms.
Once, when they worked themselves into a frenzy of fear over a non-existent
danger and finally bolted with us on board, there was little Abu's handler
could do about it, in spite of beating him over the head with the bull hook
until its fibreglass handle shattered, sending the business end spinning
into the undergrowth. The elephants simply came to a halt when they felt it
was safe to do so.
Riding an elephant in these conditions was a little like sitting upstairs in
a silent, invisible, all-terrain, open-top, double-decker bus driven by an
ever hungry, somewhat obstinate and slightly unpredictable eight-year-old
guided by calls and prods from the top deck. They are an ideal form of
transport in the intricate web of sandy islands and shallow, clear waters of
the Okavango, for they are undeterred by all but the thickest thorn scrub
and the view from high on their backs is unsurpassed.
Our expeditions were enlivened by the presence of seven baby elephants, aged
between three and five, orphans of culling operations in Kruger national
park, which turned each outing from a gentle walk into a foray with a gang
of vandals, tearing branches from trees, uprooting grasses and shrubs and
generally leaving a trail of destruction behind.
When we walked along the channels which snake through the delta, the babies
would indulge in serious feeding, snatching succulent rushes as they passed
or pulling down with their small trunks the carefully selected fluffy
seed-heads of reeds.
Although the water is rarely more than 6ft deep, occasional pools exceeded
that, and then the youngsters would completely disappear. First a trunk tip
would come questing above the surface - followed by a little elephant, black
and gleaming, which would bob up before slipping under again.
Now and then a spirit of abandon would overtake the babies and they would
thrash and beat the water with their trunks, throwing spray high into the
air with great exuberance. Once, we came to a small mud wallow and this they
could not resist, falling on to their sides and working their way into the
dark morass, or picking up gouts of mud and tossing them over their backs
and under their bellies.
The activities at Abu's Camp are not restricted to elephant riding, and keen
fishermen may take a mokoro (a canoe punted by a local guide) out on to the
water where the catches can be prolific. Game drives are also on offer, and
one afternoon I escaped with a driver and a safari truck to look for the
wild dogs again.
After a two-hour search, we came across them lying in long grass and stayed
with them as they began to grow increasingly restless, greeting one another
and preparing for an evening's hunt. With the sun sinking in the sky, they
rose as a group and trotted off to look for supper.
Ever the showman, on the last morning Randall Moore found it impossible to
conceal his circus roots and treated us to a whole series of elephant film
stunts, from mock charges to babies crawling through the sand. This,
together with the occasional need to fire over the heads of wild elephants
and the slow acting sedative administered to Kathy after her nervous bolt on
the first day, left me slightly uneasy.
On the other hand, I treasure the memory of riding with a slow, steady
elephant rhythm across a shimmering plain of waving golden grass, studded
here and there with copper-leaved mopane trees and bordered by a frieze of
rustling lala palms, their blue-green foliage making feathery rosettes
against the clear blue sky of the Kalahari winter.
Michael Woods' elephant-back safari was arranged by Twickers World, of 22
Church Street, Twickenham, TW1 3NW, 081-892-7606, and was run from Abu's
Camp in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The camp has en-suite facilities and
includes such luxuries as a daily laundry service and hot water bottles.
Elephants make unstable platforms for photography, so keen photographers
could combine an elephant-back safari with a stay at one of Ker and Downey's
photographic safari camps in the delta. The winter weather is dry,
pleasantly warm during the day but rather cold at night. Potential elephant
riders should note that they will be required to sign a comprehensive
release form, and agree not to sue, before being allowed to ride. From
London, elephant-back safaris cost from Pounds 3,037 per person for a total
of nine days.

<F P=106> ["AL-AHALI Opinion" column: "We Are Not A Gate To Tighten </F>
The Siege of Iraq"] 
  [Text] We have condemned the U.S. aggression against the 
Port of al-'Aqabah and considered it a manifestation of the 
comprehensive hostile policy against the whole region. This 
falls within the framework of the attempts aimed at imposing a 
new regional order under U.S. tutelage and hegemony. We also 
cannot find an excuse for entrenching -- with our approval -- 
this aggression against our national sovereignty under the 
pretext of conducting land inspection. 
  We want an answer to this simple question: Is there a 
decision to monitor, besiege, or inspect Jordan? We know there 
is no decision in this regard; and the UN Sanctions Committee 
says there is no such decision. The Americans are the ones who 
are imposing the siege, and the evidence is clear. The talks to 
lift the siege are being held with U.S. envoys -- the last of 
whom was Secretary of State Christopher -- not with Butrus-Ghali 
or with the president of the Security Council as the Iraqi 
brothers are doing. 
  We wanted the government to champion the opinion of the 
people, not only the interests of some importers and merchants 
who are harmed by U.S. piracy. We were ready to fight together 
in one trench to confront the U.S. aggression against Jordan. 
The government's view, however, was different. It opted for 
the policy of ostrich in front of the U.S. hyena, thereby 
ignoring the view of the people and their political forces as 
well as the good reputation of our country on the international 
level. 
  Warren Christopher's statements in London aroused anger and 
resentment because he linked these measures with tightening the 
siege of Iraq. Do they want Jordan to become a barrier in the 
face of Iraq or a gate to ease the burdens of the unjust siege 
imposed on the people who have always been generous with Jordan, 
Syria, and Palestine and who watered the soil of these countries 
with the blood of their martyrs? 
  The policy of weakness and hiding heads in the sand will 
only 
lead to more humiliation and disgrace. We are not like that and 
we will not be like that. We will continue to resist the policy 
of capitulation and normalization. We will never agree to 
seeing Jordan become a passageway for U.S.-Israeli peace 
regardless of the sacrifices.

THE WEDDING BANQUET (15) Ang Lee
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE (PG) Nora Ephron
THE FUGITIVE (12) Andrew Davis
BOILING POINT (15) James B. Harris
IN THE SOUP (15) Alexandre Rockwell
By Nigel Andrews
Cinema's PR industry has its own form of shotgun wedding. When it likes the
sound of two words together, it forces them to unite for life. Thirty years
ago word-marriages like 'spinechilling,' 'bloodcurdling' and 'ribtickling'
were the stuff of promo language. Large with hyperbole, armed with the
warheads of exclamation marks, they hurtled out from the screen towards us
in movie trailers. Today's favourite compound, more suited to an age of
psychobabble and post-yuppyism, is 'feelgood.'
But what are feelgood movies? Short answer: The Wedding Banquet and
Sleepless In Seattle are. They present human problems and then they fix
them. They ask you to believe that people are fundamentally loving and warm.
They have happy endings. And they are the disposable-tissue industry's best
friend.
The worst feelgood movies can also make you feel cheated: your tears or
cheers wrung by a form of emotional arm-wrestling, using music, plot
contrivance, limpid-eyed stars and if possible a dog. But there are no dogs
in The Wedding Banquet and Sleepless In Seattle: two of the best romantic
comedies in recent memory. And there is enough sour wit and credible
cross-accident to make any last-reel handkerchief-reaching feel well earned.
The first movie won the Golden Bear at Berlin this year. The hero (Winston
Chao) is Taiwanese-American - just like the film - and lives prosperously in
New York. He devotes half his emotional energies to his native gay lover
(Mitchell Lichtenstein), the other half to parrying parental postcards from
Taipei urging marriage. When Pa and Ma turn up in person for a two-week
visit, the lovers stash away the gay calendars, masquerade as flat-sharers
and recruit a Taiwanese girl painter, who wants a 'green card' to stay in
America, for a let's-make-the-folks-happy wedding.
Writer-director Ang Lee scarcely sounds a false note. Things go right in the
story only after they have spent a proper amount of time going wrong. For
much of the movie, the hero's parent-deterring subterfuges backfire: as when
he fills in a computer marriage form they have sent and lists a
near-impossible blend of specifications in his bride - two doctorate
degrees, five languages, an opera singing career - only for a suitable
candidate to turn up on the next plane. She bursts into Madam Butterfly
right there at the East River cafe. Soon she has been put on the next plane
out.
Around the wedding itself, the comic set-pieces are scattered like confetti.
A registry ceremony with the foreign-born bride ever more bewildered in her
responses ('for better, for richer', 'till sickness and death . . .'); a gay
best man (Lichtenstein) making sure his friend's lips are wiped after each
kiss; and games of musical woks back home in the kitchen. Here the gay
lover, conscious of appearances, leaps away from the stove whenever the
parents pass through, pushing artist-bride plus wooden spoon into the steam.
The film's final accelerando of disaster - including pregnancy and parental
truth-learning - keeps the story piquant and perilous even as the (almost)
happy ending looms.
Sleepless In Seattle also spends furlongs of footage working to deserve its
feelgood factor. Here is a romance between a boy and girl who never meet.
Well, they might meet in the final minutes, but why should I spoil your fun
by specifying whether they do; whether Seattle widower Tom Hanks and
Baltimore pen-friend Meg Ryan actually fulfil their mooted Valentine's Day
tryst atop the Empire State Building? Only Hanks's small son (Ross Malinger)
has really tried to make it work. He first set the two hearts fluttering by
pushing lonely Dad into a radio agony phone-in where he bared his soul to a
listening world including, 3000 miles away in a car, the captivated Ryan.
Director and co-writer Nora Ephron manhandles David Twohy's original story
into a semblance of her own sweet-and-sour romance When Harry Met Sally.
This is more 'When Sam Did His Damnedest Not To Meet Annie.' Sundered by a
continent, each spends the film dithering with his or her respective dates
or mates: Hanks with a hyena-laughed former flame he has re-ignited, Ryan
with her stuffy fiance Walter (Bill Pullman). 'Walter: it's quite a formal
name, isn't it?' says her mother, planting the early anti-Walter time-bomb.
And yes, soon Ryan is hankering after Hanks: a fact we recognise from her
constant re-viewings of An Affair To Remember on TV, used by Ephron as a
flag-of-distress romantic leitmotif, and from her sobbings over Cary Grant
and Deborah Kerr as they stumble star-crossed towards the world's tallest
building.
Of course the Empire State is no longer the world's tallest building. But
who wants a romantic tryst atop the World Trade Centre? Besides, Sleepless
In Seattle is all about the absurdity of romantic destiny as a concept.
'What we think is fate,' someone cracks, 'is just two neuroses knowing
they're a perfect match.' This film would be sentimental if it were not
funny at sentimentality's expense. Witness the scene where a girl sobbingly
relates the climax to a favourite weepie to two men friends, who then parody
her with a sobbing account of the climax to The Dirty Dozen.
It ends, of course, with stars and sighs and 'destiny' fulfilled. But this,
like The Wedding Banquet, is a feelgood film that puts in enough early work
in the reality department to earn its right to feel good and to make us do
so.
The Fugitive has been a monster hit in America. There any film with Harrison
Ford jumping from crashed prison vans, sidestepping oncoming express trains,
leaping from the tops of dams and exposing corruption in high places carries
the label 'Critic-proof'. Actually, American critics lauded the film, which
shows that even an intelligent person can end up soft in the brain if hit
over the head often enough.
Dr Richard Kimble (Ford) is accused of having killed his wife. He is packed
off to Death Row but escapes from his prison escort. Then he doubles back to
Chicago in disguise to start proving his innocence. Then - oh but you have
all seen The Fugitive series on TV and if you have not you may get some
fresh enjoyment out of this high-octane twaddle.
Speaking personally, I felt that the engine kept missing. Too many
coincidences. Too many 'Oh there he is]' sightings in hospital corridors,
which fail unaccountably to end in capture. Nor was I happy with the idea of
a one-handed hit man, the real killer played by ghoulish Andreas Katsulas.
Surely murdering a doctor's fully conscious, struggling wife is difficult
enough with two hands? And then there is the danger - realised here - that
the framed doctor will know how to look up the said uni-limb in the medical
records.
Never mind. Insanity has its own momentum, Hollywood its own
ignore-the-rules driving licence. Andrew (Under Siege) Davis directs at 90
mph, as if trying to reach journey's end without a single comfort stop; and
Tommy Lee Jones, in swashbuckling form as the pursuing US Marshal, screeches
round even more corners on two wheels than Mr Ford.
Boiling Point and In The Soup have nought in common but their quasi-culinary
titles and their links with the Mafia. The first is a thriller that scarcely
reaches feeding-bottle temperature. Mafia-embroiled crook Dennis Hopper,
wearing glowing orange hair, is pursued through the night by black detective
Wesley Snipes, failing to glow at all either histrionically or optically.
Lesson for the week: putting a black actor in a film noir is as problematic
as putting a white actor in a snow movie. You had better make sure your
lighting cameraman knows his business.
In The Soup we have reviewed before, when it opened to three men and a dog
at the National Film Theatre. Now this funny film about film-making is in
the West End - with its mishap-prone hero (Steve Buscemi) finding that the
shortest route to movie finance is through an even more mishap-prone Mafia
boss (Seymour Cassel) - and you may all, if you please, attend.
