<HEAD>Dominant Diamond Business De Beers In Deal For Soviet Output</HEAD>

   De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond
market Wednesday with an exclusive five-year deal to sell the
Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which could total more than $5
billion.
   The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest
gem diamond producers, will get a $1 billion advance against future
diamond sales.
   De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling
Organization, will strengthen its position as the world's dominant
diamond seller. It already markets 80 percent of global rough
diamond production of some 100 million carats.
   The Soviets do not disclose their output.
   The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond
market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African-based company because of its home country's policies of
racial separation, but now is willing to do business openly with De
Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly-held
Swiss company in May to head the non-South African businesses of De
Beers, which is controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne,
Switzerland and made available in London that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the Soviet Union for the
exclusive export and sale of the USSR diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future
diamond deliveries. Repayment would be made over five years
beginning in November.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   ``We have not had an official agreement with the Russians. In
the past, obviously, being major distributors of rough (diamonds),
Russian diamonds have found their way into the rough,'' said De
Beers spokesman Roger Van Eeghen. ``It came through other sources,
other channels.''
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization had sales of
$4.09 billion last year.
   De Beers must renegotiate several key contracts this year, which
experts have said might loosen its grip on the diamond market.
   The formal marketing of the Soviet diamonds, like those from
elsewhere, will take place in London and Lucerne, De Beers said.
   Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers chairman, said the deal would
bring ``continued stability and prosperity of the international
diamond industry.''
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said the Soviet Union, at a time of ``considerable financial
strain,'' was able to raise a $1 billion loan while signing a
contract assuring it of ``a steady flow of funds from diamonds''
over the next five years.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said.

   The Soviet Union will get more badly needed
foreign hard currency by selling its rough diamonds exclusively
through the South African giant De Beers in a five-year
multibillion-dollar agreement.
   The company is advancing the Soviets $1 billion against future
diamond sales, said officials who announced the agreement on
Wednesday.
   The Soviet Union, among the world's largest diamond producers,
reached the deal with De Beers because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African company because of apartheid, but now is willing to openly
do business with De Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   South Africa-based De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., controlled
by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa, established the
publicly-held Swiss company in May.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement that it reached the

and sale of the Soviet Union's diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   It said its Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to make a secured advance of $1 billion to
Glavalmazzoloto against future diamond deliveries.
   Repayment would be made over five years beginning in November,
it said.
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said as a result of the agreement that the Soviet Union, at a time
of ``considerable financial strain,'' was assured ``a steady flow
of funds from diamonds'' during the life of the contract.
   Company officials estimated the contract could be worth as much
as $5 billion.
   Moscow has been seeking foreign credit as it tries to bring
market-oriented reform to an economy plagued by shortages.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the $1 billion advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial

<HEAD>South African Diamond Giant To Split Into Two</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the huge South
African diamond mining concern, said today it would split itself in
two and base one of the newly formed companies in Switzerland.
   The move appeared to be an attempt by the company to minimize
its exposure to potential political turbulence in South Africa,
where a newly energized black majority has vowed to nationalize
major industries if it wins power from the white minority.
   But De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied that there
were political reasons for the company's split, saying it reflected
the international nature of De Beers and the diamond business and
that it was in the interests of shareholders and the industry. He
also said the company's earnings jumped 37 percent last year.
   Thompson made his comments at a Johannesburg news conference to
which London reporters were hooked up.
   De Beers' shares jumped 1.80 pounds, or $2.97, to 13.63 pounds,
or $22.49, on London's Stock Exchange today after Thompson spoke.
   The South African company will continue to be called De Beers
Consolidated Mines. De Beers' foreign businesses, which accounted
for 80 percent of De Beers' 1989 net profit, will be grouped under
a Swiss company to be called De Beers Centenary AG, it said.
   De Beers said it would split itself by giving existing
shareholders one share in the Centenary company for each De Beers
share they already own.
   Ogilvie Thompson also denied that the decision was linked to the
failure of Minorco SA's failed hostile takeover bid for the British
mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last year. That bid by
Minorco, which is controlled by De Beers and the Anglo American
Corp., was seen as a move by the gold and diamond mining empire to
diversify away from South Africa.
   Ogilvie Thompson said the plan had been under active discussion
since last year.
   De Beers said its earnings for 1989 came to 2.87 billion rand,
about $1.1 billion at current exchange rates, vs. 2.09 billion rand
in 1988. Revenue rose 31 percent to 4.2 billion rand from 3.2
billion rand.
   The company didn't break out quarterly or six-month results.

<HEAD>De Beers Plans To Split South African Operations From Foreign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. plans to split
its foreign operations from its South African business in an
apparent move to shelter the huge diamond mining company from
political turmoil in South African.
   De Beers said Tuesday the plans were intended to focus attention
on the company's international nature and its true business value.
   ``Basically it's going to lose some, if not all of the discount
of being a South African share,'' said Rob Davies, a mining analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton International in London.
   De Beers also announced its net profit soared 37 percent last
year.
   Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied there were political
reasons for the company's split.
   Speaking at a Johannesburg news conference that was relayed to
London, he said the split would give De Beers better access to
international capital markets; enable shareholders to better
identify earnings, dividends and assets attributable to the South
African and foreign sides of the business; and allow the two sides
to develop their businesses better.
   Analysts said the move would insulate the company _ which in
1989 made 80 percent of its profit from foreign businesses _ from
its South African ties and from moves to end white-minority rule in
that country.
   The African National Congress party has said it would
nationalize South Africa's mines and other major sectors of the
economy, if it comes into power.
   Furthermore, many investors are reluctant to invest in South
African companies because of its government policies of racial
separation. In the United States, government sanctions prohibit
Americans from making fresh investments in South African equities.
   ``It should open up the share to a wider market,'' Davies said
of the De Beers plan.
   Ogilvie Thompson also denied that the plan was linked to Minorco
SA's failed hostile takeover bid for the British mining company
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last year.
   The bid by Minorco, which is controlled by De Beers and the
associated Anglo American Corp., was seen as an attempt by South
Africa's Oppenheimer family to diversify its gold and diamond
mining empire further outside South Africa.
   Under the proposed split, De Beers' South African company will
continue to be called De Beers Consolidated Mines. De Beers'
foreign businesses would be grouped under a Swiss company, De Beers
Centenary AG, although both companies will be headed by the same
board of directors.
   De Beers said it would give existing shareholders one share in
Centenary for each De Beers share they own. The two shares will be
tradeable only as a single unit on the nine exchanges where De
Beers shares are traded, the company said.
   De Beers said it would retain a 9.5 percent stake in Centenary.
   John Taylor, an analyst at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co., said, ``Essentially, it's an extremely cheap share.
People were giving it a low rating because of the politics of
investing in South Africa.''
   The split means ``the political risk to a certain extent has
disappeared,'' Taylor said. De Beers can just allow shares in the
companies to trade separately if the situation in South Africa
deteriorates, he said.
   The plan is subject to final approval by South African
regulators, who have approved in principle. It also must be
approved by shareholders. Support already has been given by Anglo
American, which has a 33 percent stake, and De Beers Botswana
Mining Co. (Pty) Ltd., which holds 5 percent.

   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. will add two directors from Botswana and buy a diamond stockpile from the black African state, the company said. 

   De Beers, a South African company that controls 80% of the world diamond market, said it agreed to issue 20 million shares valued at about $225 million and to pay some additional cash to De Beers Botswana Mining Corp., jointly owned by the government of Botswana and De Beers Consolidated. 

   After the share issue, De Beers Botswana will own more than 5% of the South African concern's shares. 
In return, De Beers Consolidated will acquire a stockpile of diamonds built up by Botswana during a diamond-market depression from 1982 to 1985. 
De Beers wouldn't disclose the size of the cash payment or the diamond stockpile. 

   "We have had a relationship with Botswana for 20 years; we discovered the diamonds and helped manage the mines," said Gary Ralfe, a director of the Central Selling Organization, De Beers's London-based marketing division that controls the international market in rough diamonds. 
He wouldn't comment on any political implications of naming persons from the black African state to the De Beers board. 

   De Beers Botswana will choose the executives who will join the De Beers Consolidated board, Mr. Ralfe said.

   LONDON -- Diamond sales of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. "fell substantially" in the first quarter, Julian
Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said.
   Compared with the year-earlier period, first-quarter sales
slumped by a third to around $1 billion, De Beers officials
and dealers said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The downturn, which is a continuation of poor sales in the
second half of last year, was the result of weakening
economies and uncertainty during the Gulf conflict, Mr.
Ogilvie Thompson said.
   In the first three months of 1990, however, the sales
known as "sights" were unusually high, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson
said. Japanese dealers were then buying ahead of changes in
the turnover tax, he said. So the latest first-quarter
decline must be considered in perspective, he said at a
London press conference.
   Nevertheless, trade is slower at the main diamond centers
of Antwerp, Tel Aviv and Bombay, De Beers officials said. As
a result, De Beers, which controls 80% of the world's rough
uncut diamonds, is supporting the market by reducing amounts
of diamonds sold to the centers, they said.
   Last year, U.S. imports of rough and polished diamonds
fell to 7.5 million carats worth $3.9 billion from 10.2
million carats valued at $4.3 billion, said the American
Diamond Industry Association. The volume of sales fared worse
than value because of a slump in low-quality diamonds, mainly
supplied by India. A carat equals 1/142 of an ounce.
   Diamond markets in Europe and Japan were better than in
the U.S. last year, dealers said. But this year's surge of
the dollar has raised the price of diamonds in local
currencies, dealers said. Economies are also slowing down and
denting demand for luxury goods, they said.
   To counter the downturn in the market, De Beers's
marketing budget will be around $150 million this year, Mr.
Ogilvie Thompson said. The diamond jewelry trade will also be
spending around $30 million, De Beers officials said.
   Meanwhile, De Beers is anxious to preserve its diamond
cartel of producers in the present weak market, dealers say.
It recently negotiated a contract to sell three quarters of
Angola's production and is discussing new contracts with key
producers Botswana and Australia, they said.
   De Beers is expected to sell all of Botswana's output, Mr.
Ogilvie Thompson said. But negotiations with Australia will
continue for longer than expected, said Nicholas Oppenheimer,
a De Beers director. Australia wants to sell a much higher
proportion of its valuable gems independently on world
markets, dealers said.

<HEADLINE>  GIGANTIC DIAMOND ON DISPLAY IN LONDON  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     De Beers unveiled the heart-shaped jewel in London on Wednesday, with a lot
of security and a touch of drama.;    The room was darkened, then a curtain
opened. A spotlight lighted up an egg-sized diamond, sparkling on a rotating
stand and reflecting colored light around the room.;    "A truly rare and
unique diamond," said Nicky Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of his family's
diamond-mining empire, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.;    The gem is unique
and thus impossible to value, he said, though De Beers has insured it for at
least $100 million.;    There are only two larger diamonds in the world, and
Queen Elizabeth II owns them.;    The largest is the 530.2-carat Great Star of
Africa in the imperial scepter, and the 317.4-carat Lesser Star of Africa in
the imperial crown. They are kept in the Tower of London, and their value is
not known.;    Both were cut 86 years ago from one gem, the Cullinan diamond
that was 3,106 carat rough. Like the Centenary, it was found in De Beers'
Premier mine in South Africa.;    The Cullinan diamond was cut before the
"brilliant" cut was fully developed in the 1920s. This involves cutting facets
to reflect the most possible light.;    The Centenary was found in the
mid-1980s through the normal mechanized mining process in the mine,
Oppenheimer said.;    The rough Centenary diamond, which weighed 599 carats,
was unveiled at the company's centenary celebrations in South Africa in 1988.;
   It then took three years to prepare, cut and polish the jewel, Oppenheimer
said. The Centenary diamond is more than twice the size of the next largest
comparable stone, the company said.;    Gabi Tolkowsky, whose great-uncle
developed the modern cutting methods, cut the Centenary diamond in a cellar in
Johannesburg.;    The Centenary was a difficult stone to cut and polish
because its shape did not suggest an obvious approach for yielding the jewel
locked within, the company said. In its rough form, the diamond resembled an
irregular matchbox.;    "Every day I was looking at it, but at night, it was
looking at me," Tolkowsky joked.;    Finally, he said, it "talked to me and
said, 'This is the shape I want.' ";    De Beers intends to exhibit the
diamond around the world, Oppenheimer said.  </TEXT>

   Soviets Will Sell Diamonds to De Beers's
   Swiss Arm, Borrow $1 Billion From Firm

   LONDON -- The cash-strapped Soviet Union is selling
diamonds worth $5 billion to the Swiss arm of De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd. and is borrowing $1 billion from the
company.
   The contract between De Beers Centenary AG and
Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet adminstration for precious metals
and diamonds, is for the exclusive sale of Soviet rough uncut
diamonds over five years, said Gary Ralfe, a director of De
Beers Centenary. The company also received $1 billion of
diamonds as collateral, and Mr. Ralfe said these diamonds
would be sold during the five-year period to redeem the debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The deal obviously suits both parties, London diamond
dealers say. The Soviet Union has been having difficulty
paying its overseas trade creditors, and De Beers wants to
stop the Soviet Union and other producing nations from
selling increasing amounts of diamonds outside the De Beers
diamond cartel.
   De Beers is negotiating new sales contracts with Botswana
and Australia, so guaranteed diamond supplies from the
Soviets will encourage other members to toe the line, dealers
said. The South African cartel, which controls 80% of the
international rough diamond market, sells stones from its own
mines and those of other African countries, Australia and
elsewhere through its London-based Central Selling
Organization.
   While De Beers Centenary is a Swiss company, Mr. Ralfe
said the sale represented the first time in nearly three
decades that the Soviet Union had openly associated itself
with commodities dealings linked to a South African company.
South Africa and the Soviet Union are the world's biggest
producers of gold, platinum and a variety of strategic
metals, and in the past few years sometimes surreptitiously
cooperated on sales tactics, dealers say. The Soviet Union,
for example, sold its diamonds to the De Beers diamond cartel
through intermediaries, Mr. Ralfe said.
   "This is a very important deal for both the Soviet Union
and De Beers," said Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of
De Beers. The Soviet Union is raising $1 billion at a time of
considerable financial strain, while the contract will
contribute to the continued stability and prosperity of the
international diamond industry, he said.
   Estimates that the Soviet Union produces 12 million carats
of diamonds a year, or 13% of world output, are conservative,
Mr. Ralfe said. Its mines in the Yaktia region of
northeastern Siberia are rich, and the Soviet Union and
Botswana are the two largest producers of gem diamonds in the
world, he said.
   Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, the Soviet state
bank, announced previously that the Soviet Union would sell
and deposit gold and other commodities as collateral to raise
about $2.5 billion. Indeed, about 200 to 300 metric tons of
gold deposited as collateral with Western banks, has already
been "swapped" for foreign exchange, bullion dealers
estimate. The nation is forced to use commodities as
collateral for loans because delays in payments to suppliers
in the West and Japan are discouraging foreign banks from
lending it money, analysts say.
   Those sales may already be having an effect: Just
yesterday, a Japanese trade organization reported that
Moscow's overdue payments for Japanese exports had leveled
off in June, after rising for six straight months. The group
said payment arrears by Soviet trading organizations totaled
$446 million at the end of June, only a $2 million increase
from May. The trade group attributed the leveling off both to
increased payments by the Soviets and to the fact that
Japan's trading houses were more hesitant about doing
business with Soviet concerns.
   "I believe this problem is passing its peak," an official
of one major Japanese trading house told Japan's Kyodo news
service.
   Moscow's foreign borrowings amounted to as much as $43
billion at the end of 1989, estimates the Bank for
International Settlements.

   JOHANNESBURG -- De Beers, the world's largest diamond
producer comprising Swiss-based De Beers Centenary AG and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South Africa, reported a 16%
drop in net income for 1990.
   Combined net income of the two companies in 1990 fell to
US$950 million, or $2.50 a share, compared with $1.127
billion, or $2.96 a share, in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Total dividend distribution amounted to $1.113, compared
with $1.102 the year before.
   Julian Ogilvie-Thompson, chairman of the De Beers diamond
group, said Tuesday he is optimistic that the world diamond
market will improve in 1991, after a "quiet year" in 1990. He
said a decline in profits had been expected, although the
Persian Gulf crisis aggravated the drop in retail sales.
   De Beers Centenary, which controls all group business
outside South Africa, including Botswana and Namibia, and
accounts for about 80% of total earnings, was established a
year ago to facilitate the group's access to international
markets. The South African business remains under the control
of De Beers Consolidated. The foreign and South African
securities trade as one unit.

<HEAD>Office of Fair Trading To Investigate Complaint Against De Beers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was
investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a
London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De
Beers diamond organization.
   The watchdog body said De Beers ``appeared to have'' a monopoly
on diamond trading in London and it was interested in establishing
whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly.
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no
diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a
defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based
Minorco SA.
   Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South
Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and
diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   The British government is expected to rule in the next few weeks
whether to allow Minorco to proceed with its 2.9 billion-pound
(about $5.1 billion) bid for Consolidated Gold following an
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   A Consolidated Gold spokesman, commenting on condition he was not
identified, said the company wanted to point up the ``monopolistic
tendencies'' of South Africa's Anglo-American group of companies.
   De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent
of world diamond trading, has been based in London for 60 years.
   As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South
African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond
producers including Zaire, Australia, Botswana and the Soviet Union.
   The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish
whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization
because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African
company.
   There is no time limit on the office's investigation. After it is
completed, the Office of Fair Trading may decide to refer the
complaint to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   A spokesman for the Central Selling Organization said the Office
of Fair Trading notified the organization about the inquiry but
hadn't yet requested any information.
   ``It's still early'' in the investigation, said the spokesman,
commenting on condition he was not identified.
   De Beers's shares were unchanged Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange at $12 (U.S.).

<TEXT>
   A stone's throw from the smelly Smithfield meat
market is an office building complex with no sign or anything to
attract the attention of Londoners hurrying by.
   Mounted cameras, jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the
uninvited. The gold-colored interior is hushed and luxuriously
decorated.
   This is the Central Selling Organization, London-based marketing
arm of the De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy
Oppenheimer family of South Africa. Its experts sort mounds of
rough diamonds constituting 80 percent of the world's annual
production.
   But scratch the surface of this secretive world, and the diamond
business loses some sparkle.
   Sales have declined sharply, and the 56-year-old cartel is
facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to
sell more of their own gems.
   Although its prosperity and control of the world diamond
industry looks unchallengeable, the pressures could loosen its grip
and crimp its profits.
   ``This year is going to be a critical one for De Beers,'' says
Diamond Intelligence Briefs, a trade publication.
   De Beers' South African interests face an uncertain future,
largely because of a newly energized political will by the black
majority in that country, an important diamond producer. The
African National Congress has pledged to nationalize South Africa's
major sources of wealth if it takes power.
   Apparently attempting to limit risk, De Beers recently announced
it would split South African and foreign interests into two
publicly held companies, one based in Switzerland.
   After growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in
1988, rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to $4.09 billion last year
because of slowing economies, high interest rates and the
organization's two double-digit price increases in 1988 and 1989.
   The decline was sharpest in the second half of the year, when
sales fell 24 percent from the first six months.
   ``There was a very definite, noticeable slack in demand,'' said
analyst Peter Miller of Yorkton Securities Inc. in London.
   The decline has limited De Beers' scope for raising prices. This
past week, De Beers announced it was increasing prices 5.5 percent,
compared to a 15.5 percent increase a year earlier.
   The organization must this year renegotiate five-year contracts
with Botswana, the second biggest diamond producer in terms of
value, and Argyle Diamonds of Western Australia, the biggest
producer in terms of quantity.
   The government of newly independent Namibia, meanwhile, is
expected to demand a one-fifth stake in Consolidated Diamond Mines,
De Beers' Namibian subsidiary.
   The organization sells most of the Soviet Union's West-bound
diamonds, but the Soviets, the biggest value producer, have been
acting more independently and squeezing the cartel's margins, the
experts say.
   Jack Lunzer, managing director of IDC Ltd., an independent
diamond distributor in London, said De Beers undoubtedly will
continue to control the major part of world production, but its
marketing arm's profits will fall.
   The effect hasn't been felt yet; De Beers' profit rose 37
percent to $1.1 billion in 1989.
   Few diamond-producing countries dare sell their output outside
the organization, and some bold enough to leave have returned
because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone.
   Zaire returned in 1983 after a two-year split. Angola, which
broke in 1985, has been negotiating its re-entry.
   ``We are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have
been for many years,'' said Tim Capon, the cartel's director.
   The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines,
which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers
in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and
the Soviet Union.
   It reveals few details about security. It was robbed once, in
the early 1980s, when some diamonds were snatched as couriers
carried them from one building to another.
   De Beers picks its 160 or so buying customers from thousands of
hopefuls. Ten times a year, at sales called ``sights,'' the clients
are offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and
placed in a simple cardboard box. The buyer basically can take it
or leave it.
   The gems then go to cutters in the world's major diamond-cutting
centers: Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; Antwerp, Belgium; and New
York.
   Of all diamonds mined, only 15 percent will end up in jewelry,
but these represent 80 percent of the value of the world's diamond
production. The rest are put to industrial use.
   The organization is fighting the lackluster sales trend by
trying to create new demand. Last year, it spent $160 million on
advertising and promotion, trying, for example, to boost purchases
of men's diamond jewelry.
   De Beers's achievement over the decades has been to mass-market
what was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing
its value. Today, diamonds remain ``the gem of gems,'' although
millions of people own them.
   De Beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for
the industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence
in the value of diamonds.
   So far, it has succeeded. While other commodities markets have
suffered repeated convulsions, rough diamond prices haven't fallen
since the organization started announcing price changes in 1964.
   Even its fiercest competitors laud De Beers for putting up
considerable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop
mines and support the market.
   During the early 1980s, when high interest rates caused the
worst diamond slump since the 1930s, the organization prevented the
market's collapse by doubling its diamond stockpile to nearly $2
billion worth.
   But producers criticize the organization's secretiveness and
what they call its arbitrary valuation system. Some want more of
the industry's millions of jobs relocated in their own countries.
   Said Lunzer: ``It's not unnatural for people in the producing
countries to say, `Are we getting a proper share of the value of
our national resource?''' After reviewing a complaint filed by the
British mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC alleging
anti-competitive practices, Britain's Office of Fair Trading
decided in August against formally investigating whether the
organization abuses its monopoly.
   Gold Fields acknowledged the complaint was a defensive maneuver
against a hostile, and ultimately unsuccessful, takeover bid from
Oppenheimer-controlled Minorco SA last year.
   Formally known as De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and based in
Kimberley, South Africa, the company was formed in 1888 by the
British industrial colonialist Cecil Rhodes.
   Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of
De Beers in 1929 and five years later formed Diamond Trading Co.,
the precursor of today's cartel.
   Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive
Anglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with
steering De Beers through the Depression. He died in 1957 and was
succeeded by his son, Harry Oppenheimer, who has made the company
more internationally minded and therefore less vulnerable.
   Now 81, Oppenheimer still serves on De Beers' board of
directors, of which he previously was chairman. His 44-year-old son
and heir apparent, Nicholas, is deputy to Chairman Julian Ogilvie
Thompson.

South African diamond giant De Beers said Tuesday that its profit more than 
doubled last year as the gem market made a sparkling recovery from a five-year 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers Consolidated Mines, which controls about 80% of the world's diamonds, 
said after-tax profit jumped to $836 million (2.09 billion rand) in 1988 from 
$416 million (1.04 billion rand) the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of factors combined to enable us to come out with this pleasing 
result," De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The results reflect both an increase in sales volumes and higher diamond 
prices, which were last raised in May, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Pretax profit rose 88% to $1.15 billion (2.87 billion rand) and the company 
lifted its total dividend to 80 U.S. cents (200 South African cents) from 44 
U.S. cents (110 South African cents). 
</P>
<P>
The company's soaring profit followed a report in January by De Beers' 
London-based Central Selling Organization that sales of rough gems and 
industrial diamonds soared 36% to a record $4.17 billion in 1988, confirming a 
recovery in the diamond market since a deep slump that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect retail diamond sales to grow quite as well this year as in 
1988, but indications are that our main markets are continuing to expand," 
Ogilvie Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers was closely watching whether higher interest rates and the firm dollar 
would reduce sales, particularly in Japan which accounts for 22% of diamond 
jewelry sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some hesitation in Japan in the latter half of last year, but it's 
too early at this point to have firm figures for these markets," Ogilvie 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Stock market analysts said the earnings rise and marked increase in the 
dividend signaled De Beers' confidence that the extraordinary boom in the 
diamond market would continue, though probably at a slightly slower rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The broad picture seems that just about everything went well for them. The 
profit on the diamond account is restored to boom-time levels," said John 
Rogers, a partner at the Johannesburg stockbrokerage firm Edey, Rogers &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The advance in the dividend particularly indicates that these results are not 
a flash in the pan," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Eager buyers pushed up De Beers' stock price by 60 U.S. cents (1.50 rand) in 
brisk trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to close at $22.40 (56 rand) 
after the news. 
</P>
<P>
During the depression in the diamond business from 1981 to 1986, De Beers 
substantially increased its stockpile of gems and reduced its allocation of 
rough uncut diamonds to dealers and jewelry manufacturers in Antwerp, Tel Aviv, 
Bombay, New York and other diamond cutting centers. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic later paid off handsomely as demand slowly recovered in response to 
the tighter supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"If we felt there was a further hesitancy in the market, we would not hesitate 
ourselves to reduce our sales again," said Ogilvie Thompson. "That is our 
strategy and it is one that works."

FT  15 AUG 92 / Man in the News: King of diamonds - Julian Ogilvie Thompson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, the South African company
that controls the world diamond market, spent yesterday in the Northern
Transvaal. It should have been a happy outing, attending the opening of De
Beers' new R1.1bn (Pounds 200m) Venetia mine, a project which should produce
5.9m carats of diamonds a year.
He could have been forgiven, however, if the prospect of more diamonds had
left him feeling slightly queasy. With unfortunate timing, the opening
coincided with what was probably the worst week for De Beers since the
collapse of the diamond market in 1981-82.
Tuesday's announcement from the board, meeting in Kimberley, that there
would probably be a 'substantial reduction' in the final dividend did not
only knock about 18 per cent off the share price but also precipitated a
heavy fall in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It led to accusations that De
Beers had misled the market, thus dealing a blow to the credibility of one
of South Africa's best-known companies.
The patrician, self-assured Ogilvie Thompson, also chairman of the Anglo
American mining house and its offshore associate Minorco, may be the world's
most powerful mining executive, but he will have been ill-prepared for the
assault unleashed on his judgment and that of De Beers. Both in
Johannesburg, and to a lesser extent offshore, there has been widespread
criticism of the handling of the dividend cut.
De Beers sought to defend itself with a statement on Thursday which starts:
'The allegations that De Beers has lost credibility are unfair and
ill-founded.' Later in the statement, Ogilvie Thompson adds: 'Our
credibility hinges on our being honest and I believe that is exactly what we
have been . . . it was precisely because we did not want to mislead the
market that we warned of a final dividend cut.'
There is little sympathy for this reasoning in Johannesburg. When things are
going well, people are prepared to tolerate the high-handed behaviour for
which De Beers and Anglo are noted. But when a bitter pill is to be
delivered, companies need better investor relations than those enjoyed by De
Beers and Ogilvie Thompson if a hostile reaction is to be avoided.
The nub of the problem is that until early July, Ogilvie Thompson continued
to predict higher rough diamond sales by the Central Selling Organisation
(CSO) - the De Beers organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the
world's rough diamonds - in the second half of 1992. Although these bullish
sentiments were at odds with market signals, most observers chose to allow
De Beers the benefit of the doubt, given the company's record of accurate
forecasting.
But Tuesday's announcement indicated that De Beers had got it wrong. The
dividend cut and the imposition of quotas, whereby the CSO buys 25 per cent
less than its contractual commitment from producers, reflect the extent of
the error. The board said two factors - which only became fully apparent in
mid-July - combined to stymie their earlier forecast: flat demand, when an
economic upturn was expected, accentuated by the 'precipitous plunge' in
Tokyo's Nikkei index; and the 'sudden and unprecedented explosion' in the
supply of illicit diamonds from Angola.
Some industry analysts do not believe the outlook for the market could have
changed as quickly as De Beers suggests. Of the two factors mentioned, there
is sympathy for the Angolan problem, but little for wrongly predicting an
economic upturn.
Critics suggest that De Beers should not have been so bullish. Part of the
reason why De Beers' announcement was greeted by such a furore this week is
that Anglo and De Beers are famous for their conservative financial
orientation. Ogilvie Thompson exemplifies this conservative culture. Son of
a former Chief Justice of South Africa, and a Rhodes scholar, he has grown
up in the image of the Oppenheimer family, following Harry Oppenheimer,
whose personal assistant he was for four years, to become chairman of the
two groups. Like his predecessor at De Beers, he has cultivated an
exquisitely polite, highly Anglicised manner - reflected in his preferences
for French wines, shooting and fishing.
His manner and tastes sit uneasily in the rough and tumble business world of
Johannesburg. Though his ability and voracious work appetite are
acknowledged, many in the South African investment community are riled by a
regal manner which is too obviously a 'cut above' for many people's taste.
He is regarded as the personification of Anglo's arrogance: 'that arrogance
that people come to Anglo, Anglo doesn't go the people,' in the words of one
observer.
There has been a simple reason for the stand-offishness - De Beers and Anglo
have been financially self-sufficient, neither having had a rights issue.
Neither has, therefore, needed the investment community, which they have
kept at arm's length. Complex interlocking shareholdings, pivotally
controlled by the Oppenheimer family, have also put the companies beyond the
reach of corporate raiders.
This week's controversy has again raised questions about the quality of
management at Anglo. The question is also being asked whether Ogilvie
Thompson isn't spreading himself too thinly by being chairman,
simultaneously, of three large companies.
Pressure is also mounting for improved disclosure from De Beers. Investors
are prepared to accept secrecy when De Beers gets things right, but not when
it gets things wrong.
At the Venetia opening yesterday, Harry Oppenheimer conceded that De Beers
was facing 'grave, immediate difficulties'. He went on, though, to say that
these are 'the sort that we understand and have faced successfully at many
times in the past'. Unfortunately, he was not talking about investor
relations. Ogilvie Thompson may find it harder to rebuild trust with
investors than to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium in the
diamond market - though achieving the latter would doubtless help the
former.

<HL> De Beers Diamond Syndicate Flourishes
As Other Commodity Cartels Flounder

<TEXT>
   Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving. 

   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is floundering, and the international tin cartel has collapsed. 
But De Beers not only halted a fall in rough-diamond prices, it raised them an average 14.5% last year. 
Sales still soared 40% to a near-record $2.56 billion, double the $1.26 billion posted in the 1982 doldrums. 

   De Beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable. 
"Selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers; helping them to sell more is ours," says Stephen Lussier, a De Beers marketing executive. 

   De Beers helped with an advertising and promotion budget that swelled to $110 million this year, up from $43 million in 1980. 
Supplemented by $20 million spent by the diamond trade, the De Beers campaign helped raise world sales of diamond jewelry to 47 million pieces valued at $21.6 billion in 1985, up from 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion in 1979. 
Figures for 1986 aren't yet available, but De Beers says it was another record. 

   The promotional budget covers market research, a world-wide network of as many as 200 public-relations officials, and advertising campaigns coordinated by the agencies N.W. Ayer &amp; Son in the U.S. and J. Walter Thompson Co. in 27 other countries. 

   The master sales plan began in 1938, when former De Beers Chairman Harry Oppenheimer asked Ayer to woo American couples to buy expensive diamond engagement rings. 
Today the U.S. is the world's No. 1 market, with $8 billion in annual retail diamond jewelry sales, or about a 40% share, even though a 1971 antitrust law prevents De Beers from operating directly there. 
About three-fourths of American women own diamond engagement rings that cost an average $1,300. 

   De Beers's strategy is two-pronged, says Mr. Lussier. 
General "diamond image" advertising aims at perpetuating the mystique of quality diamonds as "the ultimate expression of love," he says. 

   De Beers applied similar promotional techniques world-wide. 
One out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings two decades ago. 
Now two-thirds do, and Japan is the second-largest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. 

   De Beers's Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York. 
As the sole middleman, De Beers usually avoids the acrimony that has divided other cartels. 

   The Syndicate has purchase contracts with De Beers's own mines in South Africa and Namibia (a territory controlled by South Africa), other African states such as Botswana, Zaire and Sierra Leone, and Australia. 

   De Beers offers its cache to select dealers 10 times a year at sales known as "sights." 
Each dealer gets a box containing uncut diamonds. 
The dealer must accept or reject the entire box, valued at between $1 million and $25 million. 
If the dealer refuses to buy, De Beers may never invite him back. 

   This ritual has enabled De Beers to maintain price stability. 
The cartel hasn't cut prices since it was founded more than half a century ago. 
Despite grumbling, diamond dealers generally believe that a healthy international diamond market depends on the Syndicate. 

   OPEC members "tend to do what they like," says Jo Flies, chief economist of the Antwerp Diamond Council. 
But De Beers is unique, he says, in influencing production and consumption of diamonds. 
"People mesmerized by the producers' cartels forget that De Beers is an aggressive, ruthless and effective sales organization," says a London dealer. 

   Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers's future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia. 
World diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47 million carats in 1982. 
A carat equals 1/142 of an ounce. 
About 20% of the prize diamonds are produced in southern Africa, but the market is being flooded by cheaper diamonds mainly from Australia and Zaire. 

   The Soviet Union, which produces an estimated 12 million carats of top-grade diamonds annually, is another unknown. 
De Beers has a sales arrangement with the Soviets, but Moscow has dumped diamonds before and may prove difficult to keep in line. 
Angola left the cartel last year, partly because it is involved in a bitter war with South African-backed rebels. 
Other African nations in the cartel want more control over distribution, dealers say. 

   "De Beers can't stop evolution," says Jack Lunzer, chairman of IDC Holdings Ltd., a London-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for Guinea, an African nation that isn't a cartel member. 
While sales independence from De Beers "could be disastrous" for the market, Mr. Lunzer says, that won't deter those producers who want "more information and knowledge about final sales of their material." 

   But the fate of De Beers, South Africa's most famous company, will depend largely on developments in that troubled country, dealers say. 
International sanctions, including a possible U.S. import ban on South African diamonds, pose a growing threat. 

   Recent history indicates, however, that it would be hasty to write off the cartel. 
In 1981, Zaire, which mines 22% of world diamond output, left the cartel. 
Australia was about to open a huge diamond mine and a speculative boom had led to widespread dealer bankruptcies. 
The monopoly was threatened with extinction. 

   While average prices of De Beers's rough diamonds rose 37%, prices of polished diamonds in dealers' stocks collapsed. 
The top-grade investment diamond, D-Flawless, tumbled to around $8,000 a carat in 1985 from an average of $55,000 in 1980. 

   In a series of shrewd moves, De Beers forced Zaire to rejoin the cartel by dumping diamonds. 
Meanwhile, diamond demand by consumers increased, fueled by De Beers's promotion campaign and favorable economic trends. 

   Dealers say trade is buoyant again because of lower interest rates and a weak dollar that makes dollar-priced diamonds cheaper in Japan and Europe. 
Since November 1985, prices of D-Flawless diamonds have risen 56% to around $14,000 a carat. 

   "De Beers is powerful; it is everywhere," says Alfred Lachowsky, chairman of the Antwerp Diamond High Council. 

   The cartel will continue to control world diamond markets, Mr. Lachosky says. 
"You can't mix diamonds with oil."

   JOHANNESBURG -- De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the
world's largest diamond producer, said it is holding diamonds
in London as collateral against a $1 billion loan to the
Soviet Union in light of the country's political upheaval.
   De Beers Centenery AG, the company's Swiss arm, lent the
money to the Soviet Union in July 1990 as part of a five-year
deal to sell a $5 billion rough-diamond stockpile for the
Soviets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the deal, described at the time as the first of its
kind by a Western company, the loan was to be repaid over
five years beginning in November 1990 to help meet the Soviet
Union's import arrears.
   The Soviet Union reached the deal with De Beers because it
wanted to sell a huge stockpile of diamonds without
disrupting the stable diamond market, De Beers said.
   De Beers established De Beers Centenery in May 1990 to
head its non-South African business.

FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet diamond loan honoured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the turmoil in the Soviet Union, the country has been
punctilious in making loan repayments and delivering diamonds against the
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.95bn), five-year sales agreement signed last year with
De Beers' international rough (uncut) diamond cartel.
The Soviet Union, the world's second-largest diamond producer, joined the
cartel organised by De Beers, the South African mining group, last July. De
Beers loaned the country USDollars 1bn.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director close to the Soviet deal, said yesterday
that the last Dollars 150m of the loan had been drawn down in January, about
three months later than first expected. Soviet diamond stockpiles, being
held as collateral, had been transferred to the London offices of De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation (CSO).
Speaking in London after De Beers published its annual report, Mr Ralfe said
that the Soviet diamond mines were working normally in spite of the
upheavals, possibly because they were in such a remote area and because the
standard of living was relatively good.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, said he was now confident
that his group's diamond sales would this year match the Dollars 4.2bn
achieved in 1990.
In the early part of this year the rough diamond market had been dominated
by the Gulf war, which curtailed polishing activity in Israel for several
weeks and reduced trading activity everywhere. But the first three of the
CSO's monthly diamond sales were 'reasonably satisfactory, which indicates
the underlying confidence in the trade'.
The diamond industry was well-positioned to grow, he added.
De Beers' sales contract with Botswana, the world's most important rough
diamond producer in value terms, ended in December, but Mr Ogilvie Thompson
said he expected a new one would be signed in a matter of weeks. He also
expected the CSO would continue to sell all Botswana's diamonds in spite of
the calls by some politicians for up to 20 per cent to be sold
independently.

<HL> De Beers Plans to Raise Diamond Prices
By 10% Next Month as Demand Surges

<TEXT>
   Flexing its muscles as a cartel, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month. 

   The South African concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say. 
So the increase could be as much as 20% on top-grade diamonds. 
The rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year. 

   "The diamond price increase was expected," said Jacques Zucker, of Lachowsky Zucker, diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium. 
By changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said. 

   "Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values," Mr. Zucker said. 
"Now they must accept higher prices." 

   "The price rise provides the necessary psychological lift to the market," said Peter Miller, a mining analyst at Shearson Lehman Securities in London. 
It will help the diamond producers "consolidate their gains." 

   Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said. 
In 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980. 
A carat equals 200 milligrams. 

   De Beers decided to raise prices because rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over its own quotes on the open market, said Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman. 
Demand is especially buoyant in the Far East. 
In the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added. 

   After the U.S., Japan is the second biggest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. 
Only one out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings less than two decades ago; now more than two-thirds buy. 

   "The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers," Mr. Lamont says. 
Stronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says. 
Diamonds are priced in U.S. dollars. 

   Demand for polished diamonds in the U.S., Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, and the Philippines also raised exports of the leading diamond cutting and dealing centers, primarily Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York. 

   To meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986. 

   Sales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion. 
Analysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987. 

   Yet some dealers worry because world diamond production surged to 89.6 million carats last year from 47 million carats in 1982. 
Only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say. 

   De Beers surprised skeptics and revived trade from the slump in the first half of the decade by withholding stocks and pursuing an intensive marketing campaign. 

   An advertising and promotion budget which rose to $110 million this year from $43 million in 1980 helped raise world-wide sales of diamond jewelry to a record 49 million pieces valued at $24.6 billion last year. 
In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says. 

   In more than half a century of its existence, the Central Selling Organization, which includes as members black African state producers, has outlasted other commodity cartels by never cutting diamond prices. 

   The cartel controls most of the world's rough diamond market via a "pipeline" that stretches from mines in Africa to Australia to diamond dealers and cutters.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: De Beers restricts dividend cut
to 29%

<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African company which dominates the world diamond
market, yesterday pleased investors by holding the cut in its 1992 dividend
to 29 per cent - to 79.1 cents from 112.1 cents - after announcing a 35 per
cent fall in earnings for the year.
Many analysts had predicted a much larger reduction in the payout. The
company's shares climbed after the announcement, closing at R68.85 (Dollars
21.61) - nearly 4 per cent up for the day.
Analysts agreed the size of the dividend cut indicated that De Beers'
financial health and the general state of the world diamond industry were
better than the market had expected.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said the fall in earnings reflected
the difficult second half. Attributable profits at De Beers and Centenary,
its offshore arm, fell by 49 per cent in the second half, compared with a 26
per cent fall in first.
Pre-tax profits on the diamond account fell by 20 per cent to Dollars 644m
from Dollars 801m in 1991 reflecting the impact of the quotas.
Net interest income slumped 79 per cent to Dollars 30m from Dollars 141m.
This was due to lower cash balances after the company bought up diamond
supplies that bypassed the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the De Beers
company that trades 80 per cent of world rough diamond output.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson estimated that Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m worth of
diamonds which bypassed the CSO - both legal and illegal - had come from
Angola during the year, of which De Beers had bought about two-thirds.
Attributable earnings fell to Dollars 491m from Dollars 759m, while equity
accounted earnings fell to Dollars 757m from Dollars 1.07bn. Earnings per
share, excluding retained earnings of associates, fell 35 per cent to 129
cents from 200 cents.

<F P=106> [Article by M. de V.: "De Beers, the Untouchable"] </F>
  [Text] Founded more than a century ago, this conglomerate 
with a world monopoly on the diamond trade remains faithful to 
itself: secretive, hegemonic, paternalistic, and sure of its 
future... 
  "I know from experience that the only possible way to 
safeguard the stability of the sector is by limiting the supply 
of diamonds and selling through a single distribution network," 
Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of de Beers at the turn of the 
century, used to say. Faithful to itself, and faithful to this 
principle, the conglomerate founded in 1888 by Cecil 
Rhodes--creator of Rhodesia, obsessed by Great Britain's 
expansion into Africa--owns half the world's production of uncut 
diamonds and markets 80 percent. 
  Since 1931, diamonds have escaped the almost constant 
erosion 
of prices of other raw materials. A miraculous survivor among 
luxury products, this "king of gems" and "teardrop of the gods" 
is still in insolently good health; and de Beers, a fairly 
accurate gauge of the industry's condition since it holds the 
monopoly on diamonds, is in equally excellent shape: The group's 
turnover for 1993 was $4.444 billion, compared to $3.640 the 
preceding year. In this recessionary period, it is probably the 
only one to have recorded "record sales," and it displays a 
serenity and faith in its own future that would be the envy of 
many other companies. 
  Its assurance is expressed in more than mere words: de Beers 
is making long-term investments, on several fronts, with 
astonishing audacity: in the conquest of new markets--its budget 
for this is almost unequalled anywhere--in consolidation--with 
all its uncertainties!--in agreements with producer countries, 
in exploring new deposits, and above all in constantly keeping 
supply in balance with demand--even when stocks are 
excessive...and cost is no object. 
  Zaire thinks it is independent enough to start selling 
stones 
directly to Israeli diamond cutters? Well, then, de Beers just 
signs an exclusive contract with Israel and buys them up itself. 
The guerrillas in Angola have decided to go into the diamond 
business? It spends $400 million to block the deal. Russia 
"forgets" the protocols it signed? It renegotiates, slowly but 
surely convincing the backsliders--by what means?--to get back 
in line, i.e., the de Beers line. In addition, it monitors and 
controls the distribution system with such arrogant precision 
that it sells to its clients "only as much as is likely to be 
sold." It prefers to hoard all the rest, to make sure the 
cutters do not warehouse too much merchandise. 
<H5>  Hegemony </H5>
  Does de Beers behave like a sovereign government? Is it 
authoritarian, even hegemonic, behind its velvet facade? 
Certainly. But one must admit it has succeeded where 
international agreements and producer cartels have failed. 
Secretive--it seems to keep key information under wraps as part 
of its power strategy--and paternalistic, it is reaping the 
fruits of its founders' vision. 
  What did Harry Oppenheimer, son of Ernest, say back in 1948? 
"All workers should participate in the success of their business 
and should benefit directly from its profits; apartheid, which 
amounts to disguised slavery in the mines, can lead only to 
impasse." And he supported the creation of miners' unions in the 
sector. Because stable labor relations, as he saw it, were key 
to steady production. 
  So de Beers today is cultivating "courteous" relations with 
Mandela's entourage. In that regard, it is significant that the 
former secretary general of the miners' union, Cyril Ramaphosa, 
number-two man in the ANC, is the announced successor to Mandela. 
  This attractive blend of fine-tuned philanthropy and 
judicious liberalism is characteristic of de Beers. Neither 
Cecil Rhodes nor the Oppenheimer dynasty would take offense at 
the charming words the company's current president has to say 
about Mandela. Because the company has already taken appropriate 
precautions to protect its wealth: In 1990, when the ANC 
revealed its intent to nationalize South African companies, de 
Beers immediately transferred its capital to Lucerne, 
Switzerland. 
  In South Africa itself, nothing remains but the extraction 
company (de Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd.). Whatever happens in 
South African politics, Julian Ogilvie Thompson can still sleep 
soundly on a pillow of diamonds.

<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said it is raising the average price of rough uncut diamonds 13.5% because the market is so buoyant. 

   Although dealers must wait for details when De Beers has a sale early next month, some said prices for quality diamonds valued at $4,000 or more could rise as much as 20%. 

   A spokesman for the South African concern, which controls 80% of the diamond market, said retail jewelers, manufacturers and dealers have shrugged off the stock market crash and have been vigorous buyers of large and small gems. 

   Dealers said the diamond market has been strong during the past year mainly because of growing retail jewelry demand, rather than investment-market demand. 
Total sales of diamond jewelry rose to 57.6 million pieces valued at $31 billion last year from 52.4 million valued at $27.6 billion in 1986, De Beers estimates. 

   In the months right after the stock market crash there was "hesitancy in the diamond markets," said De Beers's chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, in the company's latest annual report. 
But De Beers "responded by severely reducing its sales" in November and December to steady the market, he said. 
The reduction in supplies and good Christmas sales restored confidence in recent months, the official said. 

   Some diamond analysts said dealers may find it difficult to absorb De Beers latest price increase, particularly since it followed a 10% rise in prices in early October. 
With the lastest increase, the company's average prices will have risen 52% since 1982, analysts said. 
The diamond market could also turn sour if stock markets begin to slide again, dealers said. 

   "The market is quiet at the moment; I don't believe that the timing is right," said Jo Flies, chief economist at the Antwerp Diamond High Council, a trade group in Belgium. 

   But Hong Kong jewelers at a large annual jewelry and watch fair this month in Basel, Switzerland, said diamond sales would remain strong in fast-growing Far Eastern economies. 

   Japan now accounts for 21% of world diamond jewelry sales, after the U.S., which has a 39% share, De Beers said. 
Taiwan has slashed import duties so already firm consumption could improve further, the company said. 

   The investment market for diamonds remains quiet, although quotes of the D-Flawless investment diamond have risen to around $17,000 a carat from $14,000 last fall. 
Those prices compare with levels around $55,000 in 1980, prior to the diamond recession of the early 1980s.

   LONDON (AP) -- Angola, a major diamond producing nation,
is re-entering the De Beers Centenary AG diamond powerhouse,
ending a five-year absence, De Beers said.
   Endiama, the Angolan state diamond company, and De Beers
agreed to re-establish their relationship, De Beers said.
Angola has been marketing its diamonds independently since
1985, after civil war prompted De Beers to pull out, a De
Beers spokesman said.

   Under the agreement, De Beer's London-based Central
Selling Organization will market Angola's diamonds from its
Cuango region, or about three-quarters of the country's
annual production of one million carats, the De Beers
spokesman said.
   De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan
to increase production in the Cuango area, and an additional
$50 million over the next five years to develop other diamond
sources in Angola.
   About 80% of the world's annual diamond production is
sorted and sold by De Beers's Central Selling Organization,
which had diamond sales of $4.1 billion in 1989.

fall

<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African mining group which dominates the world's rough
(uncut) diamond market, announced yesterday a 20 per cent fall in 1991 net
attributable earnings, a result that slightly disappointed most analysts.
However, as expected, De Beers proposed a marginal increase in total
dividends, from 111.3 US cents per linked unit, to 112.1 cents.
Excluding the share of retained profits of associates, net attributable
profits were Dollars 763m or 201 cents per linked unit against Dollars 950m
or 250 cents.
Since March 1990 the group has split its operations into De Beers
Consolidated in South Africa and De Beers Centenary in Switzerland and
shareholders hold linked units.
Including the share of retained profits of associates, combined earnings
fell from Dollars 1.317bn or 347 cents to Dollars 1.078bn or 283 cents.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said it was encouraging that De Beers
sales of rough diamonds were down by only 6 per cent from the 1990 level and
'that the combined profits of De Beers/Centenary have held up as well as
they have'.
He would give no forecast for 1992 but said world diamond cutting centres
were in a sound financial position and retail diamond stocks were not
believed not to be high.
The combined diamond account at Dollars 803m, against the previous year's
figure of Dollars 911m, showed a 12 per cent decrease.
Analysts said diamond margins were squeezed from 21.9 per cent to 20.4 per
cent last year, indicating the tough conditions.
As part of its self-imposed role of stabilising the market, De Beers built
up its diamond stocks by Dollars 350m to Dollars 3.034bn.
Combined income from investments outside the diamond industry was lower at
Dollars 212m, against Dollars 227m, and interest income was Dollars 209m,
compared with Dollars 282m, reflecting lower cash balances. Prospecting and
research expenditure came to Dollars 116m, against a figure of Dollars 114m
and interest paid was higher at Dollars 67m compared with Dollars 36m.
Taxation absorbed an unchanged Dollars 254m, leaving a combined profit after
tax of Dollars 779m (Dollars 983m).
The combined share of retained profits of associates was Dollars 315m
against Dollars 367m, while the combined share of extraordinary losses of
associated companies - mainly De Beers' share of write-offs by Minorco was
amounted to Dollars 106m, against a profit of Dollars 112m.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The world's largest diamond
producer, the combined operations of Switzerland's De Beers
Centenary AG and South Africa's De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd., reported a larger-than-expected 20% drop in earnings
for 1991.
   Net income fell to $763 million from $950 million a year
earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts, who had forecast a 12% decline in earnings, said
they knew diamond sales and interest earnings would be lower.
What they didn't expect was a higher effective tax rate.
   Although pretax profit was down 16% to $1.03 billion, the
tax paid in 1991 was unchanged at $254 million.
   De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson gave no
explanation for the identical tax charge.
   One analyst suggested De Beers might be expecting a poor
1992 performance and thus manipulated the 1991 numbers to
create a lower base for comparison.
   Analysts said the decline stemmed specifically from the 6%
decline in rough diamond sales for 1991, stagnant diamond
prices and increased costs. De Beers hasn't raised its prices
since March 1990.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Cartels appear to be forever: The diamond market has been
stabilised
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There is an almost tangible feeling of relief in the diamond-cutting centres
of Antwerp, Bombay and Tel Aviv, because the diamond producers' cartel run
by De Beers of South Africa has regained its tight grip on the market.
Only a few months ago, a large number of unwanted stones was flooding the
market, and there were fears that rough (uncut) diamond prices might
collapse.
But now traders suggest that prices are getting firmer, and there are
shortages of particular types of polished stones. 'Rough (diamond) buyers
say the market is now in balance rather than a buyer's market as it was a
few weeks ago,' says Mr Mark Cockle, editor of Diamond International, the
trade publication.
A few traders suggest that De Beers' first rough diamond price increase
since a 5.5 per cent rise in March 1990 is not far away.
However, both diamond producers and De Beers itself have incurred
considerable financial pain to return the market to stability. Sales by the
group's London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls at least
80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds, fell 13 per cent from the 1991
level to Dollars 3.147bn last year - the lowest for five years. De Beers
warned last summer that it might cut its 1992 dividend in March, and
industry observers say it used up all the Dollars 800m cash it had in the
bank at the end of 1991 and was forced to borrow.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose father founded De Beers and sister company the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, and whose family still
effectively has control, said recently: 'Paying dividends is a high
priority, although in the nature of De Beers not necessarily the highest.
The highest priority is keeping the money together to protect the diamond
industry so that we'll continue to pay dividends for another 100 years.'
Apart from its own production in Namibia and South Africa, De Beers has
contracts to sell most of the rough diamonds produced by Angola, Australia,
Botswana, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Tanzania and Zaire. It
operates a 'buffer pool', stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating
stocks when demand runs ahead of supply.
Rough stones are released to the market in a controlled stream, through
'sights' offered by the CSO 10 times a year to about 160 carefully chosen
buyers. De Beers offers the quantities and types of diamonds that its market
intelligence network indicates the market can absorb. Each buyer is offered
boxes of diamonds costing between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 25m and has to
accept or reject them all.
Traders maintain that the CSO reduced the value of diamonds on offer at each
of the last five sights of 1992 to a total of about Dollars 300m - low by
recent standards. At the same time, De Beers told diamond producers to cut
their previously agreed deliveries by 25 per cent (permitted under CSO
contracts at times of stress), which means the company's stockpile is not
growing at such a fast rate.
Last year De Beers also had to cope with an unexpected flow of rough
diamonds from Angola where, at its peak, about 50,000 private enterprise
diggers were picking stones from dried-up river beds.
The stones were smuggled out of Angola, mainly to Antwerp, where De Beers
tried to buy them. At the height of the rush, De Beers' buyer in Antwerp
spent nearly Dollars 40m in one week.
The group estimates that about Dollars 500m worth of stones was smuggled out
of Angola last year, representing a 10 per cent addition to world supply.
This compares with Angolan production of about 1m carats of rough diamonds
worth about Dollars 100m in 1991.
Renewed political tension and war in the country recently has stopped the
smuggling and even brought an end to the government's own diamond
production.
Rumours of substantial smuggling out of Russia have also dogged the market.
However, De Beers says the five-year marketing contract signed in 1990 with
the then Soviet Union allowed 5 per cent of production to be sold outside
the cartel. The rough diamonds surfacing in Moscow for export to the west
outside the cartel's channels are mainly from this source, according to De
Beers.
When the contract was signed, De Beers advanced the Soviet Union a Dollars
1bn loan, and Soviet diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as
collateral. De Beers says that, in spite of the subsequent political
changes, Russia has kept its side of the deal and paid interest on the loan
on time.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at the Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services
group, says it is good news for the diamond market that stability has been
achieved at CSO sales levels above those seen through much of the 1980s (see
chart). But he suggests there will have to be substantial growth in demand -
about 6 per cent a year following a 'recovery' year with 12 per cent growth
 -to absorb all potential supply by the late 1990s.
Ironically, much of the extra supply is coming from De Beers's new R1.1bn
Venetia mine in the northern Transvaal which, when in full production later
this year, will become South Africa's biggest diamond mine.
Mr Coulson says: 'Some suggest it won't be until 1998 that the market will
be entirely in balance - and the CSO will still be left with a substantial
diamond stockpile to finance.' De Beers is looking east to help mop up the
extra supply. Having developed the Japanese appetite for diamonds virtually
from scratch over the past decade, the company is looking to new markets in
China and India by the end of the 1990s.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prospectors go for grand slam
in diamonds - The latest rush is raising doubts about De Beers' cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by
miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is
in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the
world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market.
In Canada's Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, some
of gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the
history of the North American industry.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and
prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of
the discovery.
In spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone will
find enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada's first diamond
mine worthwhile.
The odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond
hunters in Angola. More than Dollars 1m-worth of gem diamonds a day are
being smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
An estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work already and their
numbers are being swelled by 500 a day. This rise of illegal mining,
particularly in the Cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of Angola's
diamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in May, 1991,
after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time
in 16 years.
As well as experienced miners, many soldiers who could not find civilian
jobs have made their way to the diamond areas. The onset of the dry season
and the fall in river levels from the end of May this year has encouraged
what De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond
business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply
of illicit Angolan diamonds reaching the market'.
Even though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being asked
about whether there might be more to this 'explosion.' Did Unita, Angola's
rebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released? Is
Endiama, Angola's state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way? In
the murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound.
De Beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is
remarkable.
What is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angola
or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it for
granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up
and make all their efforts worthwhile.
The cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds. They are
composed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes in
tough material, but there are substitutes for this use. Gem diamonds are
solely for decoration and serve no useful purpose.
But the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen
steadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession
the price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail
market from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.
The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling
Organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.
Apart from De Beers' own production from Namibia and South Africa, the CSO
handles rough gem diamonds from Angola, Australia, Botswana, Russia,
Tanzania and Zaire.
The CSO has been mopping up as many of the smuggled Angolan diamonds as
possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering
severely from soggy demand in the US and Japan, the two biggest markets,
which share about two-thirds of demand between them.
De Beers says that, because times are tough. it will probably have to cut
its annual dividend payment for the first time since 1981. It has also told
the producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contracts
permit at times of stress.
De Beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market
through 'sights' offered by the CSO ten times a year to about 160 selected
buyers. They are offered boxes of diamonds, each worth between Dollars
500,000 and Dollars 25m. The contents are judged by the CSO to balance the
requirements of the buyers with market demand. Buyers have either to accept
all the diamonds or reject the box.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls both De Beers and
its sister group, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, was
defending the cartel again last week at the formal opening of the R1.1bn
Venetia diamond mine in the Transvaal. 'The CSO does not, and could not, run
a monopolistic system,' he said. 'In bad times like this, I sometimes wish
that we could. The fact is that the level of world diamond production, which
is carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled. Diamond prices cannot
be fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows production
and consumption to be equated.
'What the CSO for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer
pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand
is in excess of the level of supply. In this way it has been able to
preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate
luxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and
consumers of this unique natural product.'
All very altruistic. But De Beers makes huge profits from its diamond
business - a record Dollars 1.24bn in 1990 and more than Dollars 1bn last
year.
The cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early 1980s. It was a
time of galloping inflation, a weak dollar and low interest rates.
Merchants, particularly in Israel, stockpiled diamonds on borrowed money as
a hedge against inflation and when recession hit they had to dump diamonds
faster than the Central Selling Organisation could mop them up. The CSO's
diamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by
1984. Hundreds of diamond investment trusts and traders were bankrupted at
that time and Australia and Zaire challenged De Beers' near-monopoly.
De Beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been
built for speculative reasons, frequently going to the banks, the potential
financiers of stockpiling operations, to 'educate' them about the way the
diamond market works.
After the bust came boom. Diamond sales in value terms jumped by 20 per cent
in 1987 and another 37 per cent the following year. To cool the market, the
CSO imposed swingeing price increases: 13.5 per cent in May 1988 and 15.5
per cent in March 1989. Underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demand
for diamonds in Japan where lack of living space encourages people to
display their wealth by buying small but expensive items. The CSO boosted
the trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings are
regularly exchanged in Japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionally
were celebrated over a cup of rice wine.
It must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift the
diamond market as the present recession ends.
But in the meantime Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers' chairman, insists
that the CSO's control of the diamond market is not slipping.
'By mopping up Angolan supplies we can say that more of the world's rough
diamonds are passing through the CSO than ever before,' he says. 'By
applying the deferred purchases clauses in our contracts with producers we
are applying the right medicine to ensure that demand matches supply and
that the diamond market will remain stable'.
The future of De Beers' diamond operations in Namibia were discussed with
the government there yesterday. In the past there have been suggestions that
CDM, De Beers' wholly-owned subsidiary, might be at least partly
nationalised. CDM, has diamond mining operations over a coastal area
extending 100 km north of the Orange River and recently brought the Auchas
and Elizabeth Bay mines into production. Last year Namibian output reached
1.19m carats, up from 750,000.

   LONDON -- De Beers Centenary AG said it will open a
representative office in Moscow.
   "The office further cements the relationship between the
company and the Russian diamond industry," said Nicholas
Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary, the
Swiss-based, but South African-owned corporation that
controls around 80% of the world market in rough, uncut
diamonds.

   In July 1990, De Beers announced a $5 billion agreement to
sell Soviet diamonds during a five-year period. It also lent
the Soviet Union $1 billion against collateral of diamonds
held in London.
   Rossalmazzoloto, a former Soviet diamond industry
organization now under the authority of the Russian republic,
is honoring the sales contract, according to Gary Ralfe, the
De Beers director in charge of trade with the former Soviet
Union. Moreover, De Beers received repayments of $200
million, reducing its loan to $800 million, he said. The
repayments came from the sale of newly produced diamonds and
stocks held as collateral by De Beers, said Mr. Ralfe.
   Russia mines at least 15 million carats of diamonds a year
in Yakutia on the Kola peninsula. A carat equals 1/142 of an
ounce.
   A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that
Russians and South Africans -- the two largest producers of
gold, platinum, diamonds, manganese and a variety of other
strategic minerals -- would be openly doing business.

   The De Beer diamond cartel said it will raise
prices for rough gemstones an average of 13.5 percent because a
weak dollar has increased demand for their products in Asia and
Europe.
   De Beers, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, controls 80
percent of the world's rough diamond market through its
London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization.
   Sales of diamonds are priced in dollars and have been boosted by
the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to holders
of Japanese yen and European currencies.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said the price increases for a
broad range of uncut diamonds will take effect May 3.
   ``The increases are not weighted toward any particular
category,'' said spokesman Richard Dickson.
   When De Beers last raised its prices, by an average 10 percent
on Oct. 5, the biggest increases were for better-quality diamonds.
That was the only price increase in 1987 and followed a jump of
14.5 percent, in two steps, in 1986.
   De Beers does not disclose its prices.
   But, as an example, the wholesale price of a polished,
one-carat, D-flawless diamond _ the highest grade _ costs about
$15,000.
   The cartel sets prices for rough diamonds only. It operates a
pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to
dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ Antwerp,
Bombay, New York and Tel Aviv.
   ``The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds
are strong, retail demand is good,'' Dickson said. ``Much of the
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from Japan and
Southeast Asia.''
   De Beers enjoyed record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23
percent from sales of $2.5 billion in 1986.
   Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even
though De Beers cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock markets' crash,
Dickson said.
   ``We carried that cautious policy through the early part of
1988. We reacted very quickly. What we wouldn't want to do is sell
diamonds that the market couldn't absorb.''
   Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he added.
   ``The mood is optimistic and we would look foreward to 1988
being a good year,'' said Dickson.
   De Beers holds about 10 ``sights'' _ or sales _ for
international diamond dealers a year, Dickson said.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
mainly for drilling because they are so hard. From 10 percent to 20
percent are gems.

<TEXT>
   Angola, a major diamond producing nation, is
re-entering the De Beers diamond cartel after five years, De Beers
said Thursday.
   Endiama, the Angolan state diamond company, and De Beers
Centenary AG on Thursday signed an agreement re-establishing their
relationship, De Beers said.
   Under the agreement, De Beer's Central Selling Organization will
market Angola's diamonds from its Cuango region, or about
three-quarters of the country's annual production of one million
carats, said Roger van Eeghen, a De Beers spokesman.
   De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan to
increase production in the Cuango area, and another $50 million
over the next five years to develop other diamond sources in
Angola.
   Angola had been marketing its diamonds independently since 1985
after civil war prompted De Beers to pull out, Van Eeghen said.
   About 80 percent of the world's annual diamond production is
sorted and sold by the London-based Central Selling Organization.
It had diamond sales of $4.1 billion in 1989.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: De Beers loses a little sparkle
 -Philip Gawith on the dividend cut at the S African diamond producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The De Beers board has a quaint habit of meeting in Kimberley, the northern
Cape mining town where the South African diamond producer began.
Yesterday it seemed very far removed from the country's financial centre in
more than just a geographic sense as the prediction of a 'significant
reduction' in the final dividend sent shock waves through the Johannesburg
investment community.
Although the 26 per cent fall in attributable earnings was in line with
predictions, most analysts were aghast at the announcement that the final
dividend would be cut. Some said this would do serious damage to the
credibility of De Beers and Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, its chairman.
The confusion stems from the seemingly inexplicable difference between the
fairly optimistic predictions De Beers was making as recently as six weeks
ago about the outlook, and the much more bearish picture it has presented.
Until yesterday, De Beers had been sending a clear message that the position
of the diamond market was not too bad. It told those worried about the poor
results from the first three auctions of rough diamonds of the 10 to be held
this year to refer to the directors' forecast. Its main point was that sales
of rough diamonds in the second half of 1992 would be better than in the
same period in 1991.
However, yesterday the board withdrew this prediction saying second-half
sales could well be lower than during the first half.
The gravity of the group's position was emphasised by the imposition
yesterday of a 25 per cent quota reduction in the diamonds bought from
producers by the Central Selling Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers'
organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the world's uncut diamonds.
The directors offer two reasons for its changed forecast:
Low retail and rough diamond sales, due to weaker than anticipated upturns
in Europe and the US and the continued slowdown in Japan; and
A 'dramatic increase' in supplies of illicit diamonds from Angola. The CSO
has mopped up a lot of this supply, but some of it is being sold outside of
the CSO.
Recently Mr Richard Stuart of Martin &amp; Co, the firm of stockbrokers and
South Africa's leading diamond analyst, said De Beers directors would rather
cut their throats than cut the dividend. Yesterday, Mr Stuart spoke for many
when he said they probably had cut their throats as far as the investment
community was concerned.
Aside from the damage done to De Beers's reputation, yesterday's dividend
announcement casts a pall over its stock market status. Mr Charles Booth,
research director of JD Anderson, the stockbroking firm, said that apart
from being bad news for the share price - which fell by more than 6 per cent
yesterday to R68.50 on the news - it also damaged the group's reputation as
a quality stock whose dividend would never be cut. (The dividend has only
once before been cut - in 1981). He said the market might be tempted to
regard De Beers as more of a cyclical stock and to downrate it accordingly.
There was disagreement among analysts over whether it was necessary for De
Beers to cut the dividend. Although some brokers had forecast a cut in the
final dividend, saying the company would not have enough cash to maintain
it, others differed.
Mr Stuart thought the cut unnecessary given the financial strength of De
Beers, which has net assets at market value of more than R30bn (Dollars
10.9bn). He also argued that De Beers should have given the market time to
adapt to the imposition of quotas before considering a dividend cut.
Some see the hand of Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the retired former chairman of De
Beers, behind the forecast dividend cut. His thinking, it is reasoned, is
that if De Beers is going to impose quota constraints on the industry, then
it must also be seen to be taking some pain itself.
A further puzzle about the dividend cut is that it seems to be something of
an over reaction. Even with the second-half forecast revised downwards, it
seems unlikely that CSO rough diamond sales for the year will be much worse
than Dollars 3.5bn, against Dollars 3.9bn in 1991. This compares with a near
halving of CSO sales in 1981, the year of the earlier dividend cut.
Analysts caution that comparisons with the early 1980s, when the industry
experienced the worst slump in its history, should be resisted. Then
deflation in the world economy caused large stocks of diamonds, which had
been bought as an inflation hedge, to be deposited on the market. De Beers,
as a result, lost a degree of control over the supply of diamonds to the
CSO.
Today, De Beers has much improved control over the supply. The difference is
evident from the ratio of CSO stocks to sales which rose above 160 per cent
in 1984. Last year it was 77 per cent, and even with the gloomy second-half
prognosis it is still unlikely to rise above 100 per cent.
There is no comparable overhang of diamonds, excepting two problems. The
first concerns the increase in supply from Angola. The second relates to De
Beers's Venetia mine in the Northern Transvaal which opens in two days time.
Originally the mine planned to open in a US election year, traditionally a
period of firm demand in the US economy.
This calculation has clearly backfired. As a result an extra 6m carats of
diamonds - Venetia's full production - will be entering the CSO, without a
market and hence will have to be stockpiled.

   Minorco S.A. bid #2.05 billion (US$3.44 billion) for the 70.6% stake it doesn't already own of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, in a bold push for world expansion by South Africa's most powerful mining dynasty. 

   Minorco currently holds 29.4% of London-based Consolidated Gold, considered the largest gold-mining company outside South Africa and a major holder of other mineral interests in the U.S., Australia and the U.K. Minorco itself is 60.1%-owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold- and diamond-mining interests of South Africa's influential Oppenheimer family. 

   Consolidated, founded 101 years ago by empire builder Cecil Rhodes, rejected the bid as a "very damaging" act of "assetstripping." 
Whatever the financial merits, the bid could turn upside down the alliances that control the world's precious metals industry. 

   Moreover, it raises a number of political issues. 
It seems to be an attempt by Anglo American and De Beers to protect Minorco, a holding company they moved from Bermuda to the European Community state of Luxembourg last year, from the political implications of South Africa's apartheid policy. 
Besides immunizing Minorco from possible future sanctions against South Africa, it could protect the company against upheavals inside the country that someday might lead to nationalization of major companies. 

   Like most South African businesses, De Beers and Anglo American aren't discussing such possibilities. 
And whether their bid to establish Minorco as European will succeed remains to be seen. 
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Minorco and De Beers's chairman, denied speculation that the group might shift De Beers' lucrative diamond-marketing operations into Minorco's hands. 

   In addition, the move could raise political concerns in Britain as well as the U.S., where Consolidated has expanding interests. 
Last year Consolidated raised its stake in New York-based Newmont Mining Corp. to 49.7%, helping to defend Newmont from a bid by an investor group led by Texas oil man, T. Boone Pickens Jr. 

   A British special interest group yesterday voiced its opposition to the takeover and called on Lord Young, trade and industry secretary, to use his powers to block the move. 
"If it succeeds then the tentacles of the apartheid economy will have reached even farther into Britain," said Mike Terry, executive secretary of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. 
"It would also be a major setback for the disinvestment campaign, as it has been widely predicted that Consolidated Gold Fields would pull out in the near future." 

   Minorco said it would offer #9.50 in cash plus new Minorco shares for each Consolidated share, valuing the offer at #13.06 ($21.90) a share. 
The offer values the entire company at about #2.9 billion ($4.86 billion), the largest bid here since Nestle S.A.'s #2.55 billion purchase of confectionery maker Rowntree PLC earlier this year. 

   Analysts predicted Minorco would have to spend more to prevail. 
Consolidated shares were quoted in late trading yesterday on London's Stock Exchange at #14, up #3.22. 
Minorco was quoted at $12.87, down seven cents. 

   Consolidated holds a crucial position in the intricate web of relationships among the world's mining powers. 
Cozy industry ties sometimes turn nasty. 
In Consolidated's centenary history, Paul Johnson wrote that the major players cooperate but are also "mutual predators, capable of engaging at short notice in atrocious acts of cannibalism." 
Minorco held its news conference yesterday at London's Butchers Hall. 

   Mr. Ogilvie Thompson outlined plans to make Consolidated-Minorco a "major world force in the natural resources field." 
Minorco yesterday named as deputy chairman and chief executive officer Sir Michael Edwardes, a South African-born executive known for his leadership of such British companies as Rover Group, the long-suffering auto maker recently acquired by British Aerospace PLC. 

   Minorco said the merged company would seek to reduce its passive investments, selling off the South African mining operations that still generate 15% of Consolidated's operating profit. 
Minorco last year sold some of its own passive holdings, including a stake in securities firm Salomon Bros. 
Inc., raising its cash holdings to $890 million. 
Minorco said the Newmont stake could be reduced as well, noting the agreement with Newmont constrains Consolidated "from exercising any reasonable degree of control over it for many years." 

   Shares issued under the bid would reduce De Beers and Anglo American's total holding in Minorco to about 40.9% from the 60.1% currently held. 
And De Beers and Anglo American yesterday said they believe that "in today's climate, Minorco can best grow and prosper as an international company if it is properly independent." 

   De Beers and Anglo American hold significant stakes in each other. 
The extent of the Oppenheimer family's interests aren't disclosed by the companies. 

   The two South African companies said they don't plan to play a "day-to-day" role in Minorco, although they would continue to be represented on the company's board and Mr. Ogilvie Thompson would remain chairman of both De Beers and Minorco. 

   Anthony Hichens, a managing director of Consolidated, warned of opposition from U.S. and U.K. governments, and Consolidated officials suggested the sale of South African interests and Newmont would be aimed at minimizing anti-apartheid opposition to Minorco. 
Still, local governments might refuse to buy road-building materials from the merged company, he said. 
"In the end there would be an uproar and our employees and shareholders would suffer," Mr. Hichens said. 

   De Beers and Anglo American acquired the initial stake in Consolidated in 1980, in a "dawn raid" maneuver that was reviewed by the government and led to a change in stock-exchange rules here. 
Consolidated since has made great effort to stress its distance from the Oppenheimers, although Mr. Ogilvie Thompson serves on its board. 

   In the fiscal year ended June 30, Consolidated said net income rose 29% to #214.8 million on a 13% gain in revenue to #1.23 billion. 
Pretax profit jumped 24% to #302.4 million. 
Debt increased from a year earlier, reflecting the investment in Newmont. 
Minorco in the year ended June 30 reported that income from operations rose 58% to $103.9 million, while net income jumped six-fold to $774.7 million because of the disposals.

   LONDON -- Diamond sales of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. rose to a record $2.48 billion in the first half, an 7%
increase from a year earlier, the company said.
   But sales in the second quarter were slower than in the
buoyant first quarter. Dealers described the diamond market
as quiet. They estimate that of the first half's sales, De
Beers sold about 60% in the first three months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The record sales partially reflect a diamond price
increase of 5.5% at the end of March, the company said. De
Beers, which controls about 80% of the world rough diamond
market, decided to raise prices following buoyant sales in
January and February.
   De Beers reported sales of 2.32 billion for the first half
of 1989. In the second half of the year, the company had
sales of $1.77 billion. Second half sales tend to be lower
than the first half because of seasonal buying trends, De
Beers said.
   Because the diamond market appears to be slowing, total
sales in 1990 might be around $4.1 billion, about the same
annual level as the previous two years, dealers predict.
   Although sales of medium and high quality diamonds are
still reasonable, the market in poor quality diamonds, priced
at $350 a carat or lower, is weak, De Beers said.
   The U.S. market, which accounts for about two fifths of
world diamond jewelry sales, is particularly slow, dealers
said. Japanese diamond imports surged in the first two
months, but since then consumption has waned. Trade in the
European markets, however, is fair, they said.
   After the boom between 1986 to 1988, the market is
returning to normal, De Beers said.
   But Jacques Zucker, a director of Zucker-Berkovic PVBA,
Antwerp diamond dealers, said, "Diamond manufacturers are
being squeezed by falling margins." Prices of polished
diamonds haven't matched the 21% rise in De Beers's rough
diamond quotes during the past 18 months, he said.

   The De Beers diamond cartel said Wednesday it was
increasing prices for rough gemstones by an average of 13.5 percent
as worldwide sales sparkle despite last fall's stock market crash.
   Sales of diamonds, which are priced in dollars, have benefitted
from the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to
holders of Japanese yen and European currencies.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., a Johannesburg-based concern
which controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market
through its London-based marketing arm, Central Selling
Organization, said the price increases for a broad range of uncut
diamonds would take effect May 3.
   When De Beers last increased its prices, by an average 10
percent on Oct. 5, it boosted its prices for the better-quality
diamonds the most.
   But spokesman Richard Dickson said the latest increases ``are
not weighted toward any particular category.'' De Beers does not
disclose actual prices.
   The October price increase was the only price increase in 1987
and followed an increase of 14.5 percent in two stages in 1986.
   The wholesale price of a polished, one-carat, D-flawless diamond
_ the highest grade _ was more than $17,000 in April.
   The cartel, which sets prices for rough diamonds only, operates
a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to
dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ Antwerp,
Bombay, New York and Tel Aviv.
   ``The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds
are strong, retail demand is good,'' Dickson said. ``Much of the
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from Japan and
Southeast Asia.''
   De Beers reported record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23
percent from sales of $2.5 billion in 1986.
   Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even
though De Beers cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock market crash,
Dickson said.
   Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he said.
   ``The mood is optimistic and we would look forward to 1988 being
a good year,'' Dickson said. But he declined to provide a forecast.
   De Beers holds about 10 sales for international diamond dealers
a year, Dickson said.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
primarily for drilling because they are so hard. Between 10 percent
and 20 percent are gems.

<HEAD>De Beers To Raise Rough Gem Diamond Prices 5.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said Wednesday it
will raise the prices of rough gem diamonds sold through its
Central Selling Organization by an average 5.5 percent effective
Monday.
   Vigorous consumer demand and a need to keep prices in line with
global inflation prompted the rise, said De Beers spokesman Andrew
Lamont.
   De Beers pushed prices up 15.5 percent in its last increase in
March 1989.
   The organization's sales were down 2 percent at $4.09 billion
last year and are expected to be flat this year.
   Rough diamonds yielding polished diamonds of one carat and less
have been selling at a premium in the open diamond bourses not run
by the Central Selling Organization for the last several months,
reflecting the strong demand, De Beers said.
   Polished diamonds currently fetching between $400 and $3,500 a
carat, are experiencing particularly strong demand, and will bear
the brunt of the price increase, Lamont said.
   De Beers doesn't disclose its prices, which vary considerably.
The wholesale price of the highest grade one-carat gem is about
$16,000.
   The organization sorts and values about 80 percent of the
world's rough diamonds before selling them to wholesalers at
regular sales called ``sights.''

Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia,
De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with
Botswana and Zimbabwe.
Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of
USDollars 400m, De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80
per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its
producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola. For a time
Venetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for
seven-day working, moved to a five-day week.
This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so
that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to
take from producers. However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market,
caused by uncertainty about Russian exports following 'leaks' of stones from
that country outside its contract with the CSO.
Consequently, Mr Hans Gastrow, general manager, says that this year Venetia
will process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity. It is also
mining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne.
Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be
well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at
full production.
Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and
processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. About 70 per cent of
Venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars
100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars
500m.
Mr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia
'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'.
This year will be a time of consolidation.
He insists that the quota is having no impact on employment. Nevertheless,
Venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764. A mine of
Venetia's size in the past would have employed 2,000. The total has been
kept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewer
people employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs',
according to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.
Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years. It is
also the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export
earnings.
The mine has also revitalised De Beers' production, as it is accounting for
half the group's output in South Africa and replacing production from its
100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.
Venetia's success is strategically important to De Beers because, when its
output is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group direct
control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. This
provides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerful
position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.
And, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes
of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected
23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour
relations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa is
concerned.
For example, there are no migrant workers at the mine. Employees are bussed
in from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.
Venetia is also breaking with the De Beers' tradition that, for security
reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security
area once it is no longer useful. Here worn out equipment will be stockpiled
and sold off when the mine closes. It could be worth millions of dollars.

   LONDON -- The diamond market is beginning to bottom out,
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said.
   Rough, uncut diamond sales of $2.1 billion in the first
half were 23% higher than in the final six months of 1990,
the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the market is still uncertain, a De Beers official
added. First half turnover was 16% lower than in the
year-earlier period, and sales tend to be higher in the
initial six months of each year, dealers said.
   Total turnover of De Beers, which controls 80% of the
rough, uncut diamond market, was $4.2 billion, last year,
against $4.1 billion in 1989.
   "It is too soon to say whether a recovery is under way," a
spokesman for De Beers said, adding: "A rebound in the U.S.
economy should help the diamond market in the second half."
   The diamond market was weak in the three quarters ended in
March, mainly because of the Gulf War and the downturn in
U.S. jewelry sales, diamond dealers said.
   But Israel, the second-largest diamond market in the
world, raised orders for diamonds as soon as the war ended,
the De Beers official said. Nevertheless, the market remains
muted, dealers said. U.S. retail diamond sales were down in
the first half, while orders in Japan and Germany were
"flat."
   The recovery of the dollar raised the price of diamonds in
local currencies, dealers said, and slowing business
conditions lowered the demand for luxury goods, they added.
   To help revive the market, the advertising and promotional
budget of De Beers and the diamond jewelry trade will be
about $180 million, the company said.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: De Beers raises dividend 7% as
earnings climb

De Beers, the South African company which dominates the world diamond trade,
is lifting its total 1993 dollar dividend by 7 per cent. The lift confirms
the stout turnround in the diamond business from the difficult conditions in
1992.
The dividend is increased to 84.4 US cents a share from 79.1 cents in 1992.
Earnings rose 16 per cent to 230 cents from 199 cents a share.
The shares reacted strongly to the news, climbing to a new high of R116 on
the Johannesburg stock exchange, before retreating to R115 at the close. Mr
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was 'pleased' with the results,
which were underpinned by the first increase in four years in global retail
diamond sales.
The group's Central Selling Organisation (CSO) sold a record Dollars 4.37bn
in rough diamonds in 1993, against Dollars 3.42bn the year before, led by
good demand in the US and east Asia. Mr Jeremy Pudney, CSO marketing
director, said Korea, Taiwan and Thailand had overtaken France and Germany
as the group's most important markets after the US, Japan and Italy.
However, demand in Japan and Italy remained weak.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a director, said the group's relationship with Russia
remained uneasy, although sales in December of uncut diamonds from the
country's Treasury stockpile - in breach of a marketing agreement between De
Beers and the government - had not been repeated so far this year.
Pre-tax income rose to Dollars 789m from Dollars 728m, reflecting the
overall improvement in the jewellery trade and an increased contribution
from South African operations, boosted by the build-up to full production at
its new Venetia mine.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said results from Centenary, De Beers' Swiss-based arm,
were hit by retrenchment costs at Namibian mines and the Irish-based
industrial diamond division, plus its smaller share of total diamond sales
as Venetia's output increased.

<F P=106> [Article by Marc Roche: "Decartelization an Optical </F>
Illusion"] 
  [Text] The multinationals that control 80 percent of the 
shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange have prepared 
themselves for the country's first multiracial elections. 
Ostensibly, to make the transition to economic power sharing. In 
reality, to shelter their assets.... 
  London--"We must encourage participation of South Africa's 
blacks in the mining and financial groups; it can only be 
beneficial to all sides." For the Anglo-American Corporation, 
the 30 March announcement of the dismantling of the cartel's 
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company (JCI) subsidiary 
marks an historic step on the road to "the new South Africa." A 
new leaf, oh yes, by all that's holy! "Anglo" directors swear up 
and down that the break-up of the large industrial group--which 
encompasses independent entities in such diverse domains as 
gold, coal, agrofood, the press, and breweries--is bound to 
create many jobs at every level that are open to blacks. 
  But serious London analysts of the South African economy are 
not fooled: "Modification of the corporate structure and the 
opening of a few companies amount to nothing more than the 
business community throwing a few scraps to Mandela. It is a 
phony dismemberment that does not redistribute any national 
wealth to black entrepreneurs," opines one city expert. Julian 
Ogilvie Thompson, current president of Anglo-American and de 
Beers, has already taken the precaution of purchasing JCI's 
highly lucrative platinum division and its 16-percent interest 
in de Beers, the world's biggest diamond firm. 
  The extraordinary high-wire maneuvering by South Africa's 
big 
multinationals in preparation for the first multiracial 
elections has led entrepreneurs--English-speakers and 
Afrikaners--to coin a new term: unbundling [preceding word in 
English] (literally, decartelization). Does it amount to a 
cultural revolution, with white businesses cooperating in 
economic power sharing and agreeing to be melted down into the 
new mold? Or is it all a conjuring trick, allowing a handful of 
groups to continue controlling the economy? 
  Appearances would tend to support the former version, but 
the truth is probably closer to the latter. 
<H5>  Mastodons </H5>
  Anglo-American-de Beers; Rembrandt Group; Old Mutual; 
Sanlam; 
Liberty Life.... Whenever one thinks about the South African 
economy, the temptation is to identify it with these five 
groups, which like all-devouring octopi control between them 80 
percent of the stock on the Johannesburg exchange. These 
ubiquitous mastodons hold interests in every domain and have 
swollen to enormous size through acquisitions. 
  For a very long time, the ultrastrict controls on foreign 
exchange (through the intermediating mechanism of a dual market 
for the South African rand), which prevented them from investing 
abroad, constrained these giants to invest in sectors quite 
remote from where they started. Their structure is pyramidal, 
via holding companies at the top that have permitted a handful 
of great families such as Oppenheimer, Rupert, and Gordon to 
keep control over their assets without holding a majority of 
their subsidiaries' stock. As defenders see it, such a financial 
system protects the companies against hostile takeover bids, 
inspires confidence in the banking sector, and makes it easier 
to raise the capital needed for large investment projects, 
notably in mining and mineral exploration. 
  Until just recently, Brian Gilbertson headed a shadowy group 
known as Gencor. A year ago, Sankorp, the investment holding 
company, itself a subsidiary of the Sanlam insurance company, 
granted "independence" to four of Gencor's subsidiaries: Malback 
(pharmacy), Sappi (lumber industry), Engen (oil refining), and 
Genbel (finance). 
  This "vertical" dismemberment was effected to enable Gencor, 
the world's largest producer of platinum and second-largest 
producer of gold, to shift the focus back to its mining 
activities. To hear its president talk, the break-up came in 
response solely to the financial imperative of reducing the 
incongruous disparity between the relatively weak stock market 
performance of the subsidiaries and the stronger performance of 
the conglomerate's stock. 
  This capital restructuring was also intended to allay the 
apprehensions of big American and British institutional 
investors, which distrust conglomerates that are too complex. 
"These massive, hypercentralized conglomerates are real 
dinosaurs that no longer have a place on the contemporary 
economic landscape, since their boards of directors cannot 
really be made accountable to shareholders," says Steve Oke of 
the Smith New Court firm. 
  But what is most intriguing is the political significance of 
this far-reaching restructuring. Sankorp, for example, sold its 
10-percent interest in an insurance company to an insurance 
group, Methold, held by black interests. The ANC, after being 
consulted discreetly by Finance Minister Derek Keys, Gencor's 
CEO from 1986 to 1991, gave the green light. 
<H5>  Offshore </H5>
  But to infer from this that South Africa's future will be 
one 
of sweetness and light.... Well, as commentators have pointed 
out, most of the recent dismantlings--with Gencor the major 
exception--have led to the creation of extraterritorial offshore 
vehicles intended primarily to protect overseas holdings. Such 
is the case with Anglo-American, which controls nearly 40 
percent of de Beers, which itself controls about 30 percent of 
the former. In October 1993, Anglo-American transferred all its 
non-South African interests except for diamonds to a "screen" 
company, Minorco, 75 percent of whose stock is held by the 
Oppenheimer family. Established about two decades ago as a 
portfolio company, Minorco has become a mining enterprise in its 
own right. "Well played! Thanks to Minorco, which is now its 
secular arm overseas, Anglo-American can present itself as a 
purely African operator. Anglo can tell Mandela that all its 
investments are either local or in neighboring countries," says 
one observer. 
<H5>  Skepticism </H5>
  As for de Beers, it founded the Zurich-based de Beers 
Centenary AG, which has acquired synthetic diamond fabrication 
plants, financial interests in several holding companies, and 
quantities of diamonds from the Central Selling Organization in 
London. For its part, de Beers Consolidated Mines retains only 
South African interests. The two companies are run by the same 
man, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, and have the same board of 
directors--and shares in them cannot be purchased separately on 
the stock exchange. 
  South Africa's second biggest industrial house, the Rupert 
family, has a Swiss holding company, Richemont (established 
1988), that controls foreign assets, notably the maker of 
Rothmans cigarettes and luxury brands Cartier and Alfred 
Dunhill. South African assets are managed by a separate company, 
Rembrandt. Johann Rupert, the founder's son, holds only an 
honorary title as director of Richemont, but he keeps close 
watch on the illustrious luxury companies it manages. He's 
always levelheaded and ready for dialogue with the ANC, but firm 
and even intransigent when it comes to the essentials: the 
interests of his group. It is the same with Nicky Oppenheimer, 
who is "only" vice president of Anglo and de Beers but keeps 
close tabs on titular director Julian Ogilvie Thompson. 
  These maneuvers by the white capitalists have been greeted 
with skepticism in London. Some observers have pointed out that 
while the word nationalization may be banned from ANC's 
vocabulary now, Nelson Mandela's party has vowed to break the 
mining oligopolies with antitrust legislation. But only a wizard 
could say when and how any new regulations might force these 
national "institutions" to give up any of their wealth. 
  Given the great danger of economic paralysis in South 
Africa, 
the enormity of the task awaiting the new government team, and 
the commercial inexperience and financial weakness of potential 
black shareholders, analysts are under no illusions: The era of 
the great South African cartels has not yet ended.

FT  09 MAY 94 / African empire open to the world: Anglo American and De
Beers have much to celebrate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo American Corporation, the world's
largest natural resources group, had two reasons for celebration at the
weekend.
There was the successful outcome of the first all-race elections in South
Africa, where Anglo dominates the economy.
There was also a 60th anniversary party in London for the Central Selling
Organisation, the most successful cartel in history, accounting as it does
for 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds. The CSO belongs to
De Beers, another element in Mr Harry Oppenheimer's industrial empire and
another company which has Mr Ogilvie Thompson as chairman.
Anglo and De Beers are emerging from difficult years of apartheid, isolation
and frequent tension with their government. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has to
ensure that the empire continues to flourish as South Africa rejoins the
rest of the world, a South Africa that, he believes, has the capacity to
grow economically as fast as Brazil did in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Apartheid, he says, was economically disastrous for South Africa, in that it
'stopped the clock'. But the delay in bringing in electoral reform had one
big advantage: 'The system of socialism and central planning as practised in
Russia and eastern Europe has been shown not to work.'
Among other things, this means that Anglo is no longer such a natural target
for an ANC-controlled government either to break-up into its mining,
industrial and investment parts, or to nationalise. The ANC, he says, has
been 'on a great trek to economic sanity'.
He says the degree of Anglo's domination of the country's economy has been
exaggerated. However, by its own 1993 calculations, Anglo represents about
25 per cent of the Johannesburg stock exchange and 6 to 7 per cent of South
Africa's capital assets.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson insists that small countries such as South Africa cannot
afford US-style anti-trust legislation if they are to have companies that
can compete internationally. Sweden and the Netherlands show what can be
done. Anglo is urging the new government to have an independent inquiry into
competition policy. 'I can't believe that the country will be so silly as to
penalise success.'
And if Anglo were to be split up, the likely buyers would be existing
pension funds and other institutional investors. It would do little for
black empowerment, he says. Instead Anglo is promoting black ownership of
business, for example, by prompting the 'unbundling' of Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments (JCI), a mining and industrial concern in which
Anglo and De Beers hold nearly 50 per cent, in a way that should transfer
control of some assets to black investors. The Sowetan newspaper is also
being transferred to black ownership. And last year Anglo spent about R100m
(Pounds 13.7m) buying products and services from small mainly black-owned,
businesses that it had encouraged with training and, sometimes, financial
help. 'You need big businesses for exports but small businesses create most
of the jobs,' says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
However, Anglo remains very much an anachronism when viewed by international
investors. It is a huge, centralised group with complex cross shareholdings
that, according to its critics, renders management unaccountable to
shareholders. The complicated control structure ensures that Anglo remains a
family business, even though Mr Harry Oppenheimer, 84-year-old son of the
founder, retired as chairman 12 years ago.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson admits: 'We have a major job to get our structure
understood. We must improve our presentation of ourselves.' But he insists
Anglo is not a conglomerate in the 1980s American style, it has not
developed by acquiring companies for shares but by starting most from
scratch and 'following our noses'. Its metallurgical skills lead it to set
up the Highveld steel company, for example. He recalls that the South
African mining industry developed the way it did because of shortages of
capital and skills. 'When you had a good metallurgist, you shared him among
several companies.'
Anglo has been 'tidying up' its structure to make it more logical. Most of
the industrial assets have been moved into Amic (Anglo American Industrial
Corporation). A reshuffle of assets between Anglo and Minorco, its
Luxembourg-registered offshore investment arm, has ensured there will be no
conflict of interest - Anglo searches for mineral opportunities in Africa,
Minorco gets the rest of the world.
There is still some tidying up to do and more non-core assets will be sold,
such as the Argus newspaper operations being acquired by Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspaper group.
But 10 years from now, the Anglo-De Beers group will not look much
different, Mr Ogilvie Thompson says. The relationship between Anglo and De
Beers - cemented by substantial cross shareholdings - has worked well for
years and there is no reason to suppose it will not go on doing so. De Beers
concentrates on the diamond business. Anglo will continue to invest in
diamonds through De Beers and continue to provide De Beers' technical needs
 -'that way we can offer the people we hire much wider scope'.
De Beers needs a very strong balance sheet to be able to finance the troughs
in diamond demand or sudden increases in supply. So it will continue to
build up investment in 'a portfolio of companies competently run, because De
Beers' people need to put all their concentration on diamonds'.
Cashflows will be used for businesses the group knows well. Anglo's profile
might change slightly if South African exchange controls are removed and it
can invest abroad. But as Minorco is cash-rich and unhampered by the
restrictions, 'we are not champing at the bit for that to happen'.
He suggests South Africa should work towards the removal of exchange
controls but 'timing is everything. We cannot run the risk of capital being
withdrawn in a hurry.'
The staying power of the group is well illustrated by De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation which yesterday welcomed clients from all over the
world for a 60th anniversary party.
After last year's record performance - CSO sales reached Dollars 4.4bn
(Pounds 3bn), some 5 per cent ahead of the previous record in 1988 - the
diamond market 'opened firm' this year, says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
Nevertheless, De Beers faces some substantial challenges.
It is still restricting the quantities of stones it takes from producers who
belong to the cartel - only 85 per cent of those contracted for. This is a
clear sign that supply continues to outpace demand. And stocks are already
high - De Beers' own have a book value of about Dollars 4bn and probably
have a much higher market value.
But the biggest threat to the cartel is Russia, which supplies about 25 per
cent of the world's gem diamonds by value, and whose contract with the CSO
runs out next year. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has already scolded the Russians for
selling diamonds from their stocks 'in contravention of our agreements'.
He says most of those officials in Russia who have been in the diamond
business for years want to stay with the CSO.
Others, such as Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Komdragmet, the Russian diamond
and precious stones committee, 'are not totally committed. We have 18 months
to convince them that it is in their best interests.'

FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investors sought for Zimbabwe
diamond mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River
Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates
the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern
border of Zimbabwe. De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to
concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the
heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South
Africa. After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production
as Venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines.
The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991
after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about
marketing the diamonds. The government insists that all minerals are sold
through its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.
Mr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new
joint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site
before leaving.
Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from
the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines.
(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site
before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River
Ranch had been bulldozed.)
Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De
Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. He helped
Auridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was
once chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up
for tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.
The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m
tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in March
last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of
gem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.
Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds
780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp;
Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to
330,000 carats.
The increase will be reached in two phases. The first, costing USDollars
2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second will
cost Dollars 8.7m. The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy and
move a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZ
Corporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
The joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of
ground around the mine and Mr Baxter-Brown suggested the chances of finding
another diamond deposit were good.
While most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a
carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6
carats. A 28-carat stone was sold for Dollars 110,000 or Dollars 4,000 a
carat, and one of 17 carats for Dollars 95,000 (Dollars 6,000 a carat).
Diamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and not
through De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per
cent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade. But as Mr Baxter-Brown
pointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.'

FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers remains in the dark
about extent of Russian diamond smuggling

<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African group which controls about 80 per cent of the
world's rough (uncut) diamond trade, yesterday admitted it had no clear idea
of how many gem stones were being smuggled out of Russia.
It also became clear yesterday that De Beers faces competition from Japan in
Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes
to help set up a cutting centre.
In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the
Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing
five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough
diamond exports.
De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 that gives its Central Selling
Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russian rough diamond exports until
1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the former Soviet Union against
stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London.
However, though Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the
agreement has repeatedly been called into question.
'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be ended by a
pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that CSO is
Russia's best opportunity,' said De Beers deputy chairman, Mr Nicky
Oppenheimer.
Mr Valery Skripchenko, the deputy head of a group within Russia's budget
committee which is looking into the structure of the diamond industry,
suggested yesterday that De Beers was also seeking a monopoly of Russian
exports of polished stones in addition to that it enjoyed for rough gems. He
suggested a fresh parliamentary investigation could be launched when
parliament reconvened on September 22.
His objections appear to have been prompted by an outline agreement reached
last week by De Beers with Yakutia, the semi-autonomous republic within
Russia, to set up a stone-polishing factory.
Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers' director responsible for liaison with Russia,
said that if the agreement went through, his group would supply technology
for the plant and 'help' sell the polished stones it produced - which would
still account for a tiny proportion of rough gems mined in Yakutia.
But if Yakutia instead concluded a diamond-polishing deal with a rival
Japanese company called ARDA, De Beers would have no control over polished
stones sales by Yakutia, which does not yet have its own stone-cutting
capacity.
Asked about the smuggling problem, Mr Ralfe said it was impossible to tell
how many diamonds were leaking from the former Soviet Union in contravention
of the 1990 agreement. He believed smuggling was taking place without the
sanction of government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing
like on the scale of the illegal flood of diamonds out of Angola.

DIAMOND SMUGGLING from Russia is adding to the turmoil in the market for the
precious stone, De Beers admitted yesterday, but the group, which controls
80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, said it had no clear
idea of the extent of the leakage.
Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for liaison with the
Russians, said it was impossible to tell how many diamonds were being

He believed the smuggling was taking place without the sanction of the

with the illicit flood of diamonds out of Angola where an estimated Dollars
1m worth a day are being smuggled to Antwerp.
He said he understood some rough gems were being smuggled out by joint
ventures which only had the right to export polished stones. Mr Ralfe said
he could not disclose official figures for Russian diamond output but denied
one suggestion that production had fallen from 11m to 4m carats. 'We sell
well in excess of 4m carats a year.'
It also became clear yesterday De Beers faces competition from Japan in

  [Text] On 17th May, 1994 discussions were held in Moscow 
between a Russian delegation headed by the acting minister of 
finance, Sergey Dubinin and a delegation from De Beers 
Centenary, headed by the chairman of the Central Selling 
Organisation, Nicky Oppenheimer. 
  The new series of official discussions, of which this was 
the 
first, is aimed at considering modifications to the existing 
marketing agreement between Russia and De Beers in response to 
the political and socio-economic changes that have taken place 
in Russia since it was signed. Further meetings on the subject 
will take place in the near future. The parties remain 
committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on 
any modification. They are also committed to the stability of 
the international diamond market and to taking the necessary 
steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market 
outside the current marketing arrangements. 
  During the discussions the parties re-iterated their joint 
responsibility, as the world's two largest gem diamond 
producers, to the international diamond market and to the 
well-being of the world diamond community. The parties hope 
that the new series of discussions will re-establish a solid 
base for on-going co-operation into the future and thereby 
ensure the further development of the international diamond 
business, to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of the 
entire diamond industry.

FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Botswana tries to loosen De
Beers' grip - The world diamond cartel faces strong calls for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana, the world's most important
diamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South African group which
controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking
much longer than expected. The previous three-year contract ended on
December 31.
Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract
so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the
South African group's international cartel. This would give Botswana its own
'market window' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market.
De Beers is resisting any change. Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the
group's Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to
sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO's ability
to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.
He said: 'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell
exclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly
market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.'
However, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most
experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO,
suggests the CSO's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual
argument with little substance in fact.'
In presentations to Botswana's Minerals Policy Committee and members of
parliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially
essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output,
but that the country had a political responsibility to do so.
'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position
to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' IDC
pointed out. 'On a political level this would enable the government to
answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when
questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral
assets.'
If Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth
about USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars
4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to
market stability, IDC said.
It claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers' diamond
profits in 1989 came from Botswana. 'This profit is disproportionate to the
sale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO
as a percentage of the CSO's total sales profits,' IDC says.
'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the
only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the
CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale
of its diamonds.'
Other substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and
Australia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have
access to independent market information.
IDC does have a vested interest. It already markets diamonds for producers
in Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering
to do some marketing for Botswana.
It acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO's
efforts to keep the diamond market stable. But 'the fact that the CSO forms
part of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary
responsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.'
De Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account
profits - but it will not divulge the true figure.
It suggests IDC's arguments are flawed because they are based on an
assumption that Botswana needs more market information. However, in common
with other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed
independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the
prices paid.
According to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market
conditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.
Mr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that
the assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and
that the agreed contract price is paid. 'He is not a trader, he does not
know what the stones are worth in the market.'
De Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the
country is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. It is not the first
time that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.
The Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De
Beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's
understanding of the market.
There has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since
1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for
an estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South
African group.
Analysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case. De
Beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough
diamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania,
Zaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.
Prices of rough diamonds, with few exceptions, have moved upwards every year
since the 1930s depression. But now De Beers is steering the world's most
successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the
recession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in
Japan (the second-largest), and the Gulf war.
To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great
expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. Its
promotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a
week - Dollars 53m for the year.
In addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982
and, according to De Beers' calculations, one of its diamond mines  - Orapa
 -needs investment of USDollars 600m.
The CSO has also notched up some recent coups: bringing a big part of the
Soviet Union's and Angola's rough diamond output back into the cartel - or
what it calls its 'single channel marketing' - arrangements.
However, the CSO is also currently involved in contract negotiations with
Argyle Diamonds, the western Australian company which is the biggest
individual diamond producer in volume (but only sixth in value) terms.
Argyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 -
but on more favourable terms.
A delegation from Botswana is to meet CSO representatives in London at the
end of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock. The industry is
betting that Botswana will give way, perhaps in return for De Beers helping
to finance the Orapa mine investment. However, the 'market window' idea is
unlikely to be dropped and will almost certainly be raised again when the
next contract negotiations start.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers and Namibia reach
accord on diamond operations
</HEADLINE>

De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond business,
yesterday secured its position in Namibia for the next 25 years - or until
the diamonds run out - by effectively handing over to the government there
50 per cent of its subsidiary, CDM.
The company will be reconstituted as Namdeb Diamond Corporation in which De
Beers and the Namibian government will each own 50 per cent. The government
will not be putting any capital into the new organisation.
Mr Sam Nujoma, Namibia's president, said yesterday that his country would,
via tax and dividends, collect additional revenue from the country's diamond
operations. For the present financial year Namibia has budgeted to collect
USDollars 56m in taxes and duties from these operations, based on depressed
1993 earnings.
Nevertheless, the signs are that De Beers is pleased with the deal,
completed after two years of tough negotiations and similar to its
arrangement with the Botswana government.
The accord signed in Windhoek gives De Beers:
The assurance that it will be able to continue to exploit its existing on
and off-shore assets in the country and that its renewable prospecting
licences will protected;
A guarantee that all of Namdeb's output will be marketed through De Beers'
London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds;
Retained control of De Beers Marine, the company that provides the
technology and equipment for off-shore diamond mining. Debmarine, which last
year, in terms of carats, accounted for about one quarter of the diamonds
CDM produced, will have only a contractual relationship with Namdeb.
Also, CDM's part-interest in the Navachab gold mine, near Karibib, will be
retained by De Beers under the accord.
Revenues from diamonds account for 11 per cent of Namibia's gross domestic
product and 34 per cent of its export earnings.
Mr Nujoma said yesterday: 'No longer will Namibia's diamond industry lurk in
the darkness of suspicion and strike; we are now forging an equal
partnership subject to the disciplines of both public scrutiny and the
private market.'
CDM, which moves huge tonnages of beach sands to find most of its diamonds,
is by no means De Beers' largest producer. Its output, down from 1.5m carats
in 1992 to 1.1m last year, is overshadowed by Botswana's 14.7m carats, down
from nearly 16m.

   The De Beers diamond firm has
announced the discovery of an egg-sized, 599-carat diamond and said
it is currently the world's largest uncut diamond with an estimated
cut value of $30 million.
   Officials of the South African company said the white diamond,
dubbed ``The Big Rock,'' was found at a mine near Pretoria in July
1986, but its discovery was kept secret to all but a handful of De
Beers executives.
   De Beers' chairman Julian Thompson announced the find at the
firm's 100th anniversary banquet in Kimberly Friday night.
   ``It's a perfect blue-white color,'' said South African gem
expert Gaby Tolkowski, who will cut and polish the stone.
   There have been larger raw diamonds uncovered previously, but
they were cut into smaller gems.
   The 1988 Guinness Book of World Records recorded the Cullinan
diamond as the world's largest uncut diamond ever found. It was
discovered in 1905 near Pretoria and weighed 3,106 carats, or more
than 1.25 pounds.
   The Cullinan was cut into 105 stones, including the 530.2-carat
Star of Africa, the world's largest known cut diamond, according to
Guinness. The Star of Africa is the centerpiece of the British
royal scepter.
   In its cut form, the ``Big Rock'' is expected to be about 350
carats and sell for an estimated $30 million, the company said.
   DeBeers is the world's largest diamond company and controls an
estimated 80 percent of the world's diamond production through its
central selling organization in London.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond cartel 'needs sales
boost'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DE BEERS' rough (uncut) diamond sales will have to rise to about Dollars 5bn
a year before the South African group, which controls about 80 per cent of
world trade, can start to whittle away at stocks that are growing at an
alarming rate, analysts believe.
This compares with its record sales of Dollars 4.17bn in 1988 and the
second-best level of Dollars 4.16bn in 1990.
Mr Graham Roberts, research director at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the
Banque Indosuez Group, pointed out yesterday that De Beers' Central Selling
Organisation (CSO) had contracted to buy about Dollars 4.4bn of diamonds
from producers next year. Another Dollars 300m of rough diamonds would be
left with producers this year because De Beers had told them it would take
only 75 per cent of their output from September onwards - as permitted under
the terms of the CSO contract.
The CSO attempts to stabilise the rough diamond market by stockpiling excess
gems during times of market weakness and then releasing them as conditions
improve. So, assuming that smuggling from Angola, Russia and other areas
continues but at a reduced rate, there may be a further Dollars 400m of
rough diamonds to be mopped up if De Beers wants to maintain a stable
market.
Mr Roberts suggested De Beers' rough diamond sales would be about Dollars
3.4bn this year, that its cash balances would be seriously reduced and that
'it might even have to borrow money.'
The worrying aspect of the present situation was that many of the problems
De Beers faced were structural and outside its control, he added.
Meanwhile, a special report today from the Economist Intelligence Unit
suggests that De Beers diamond sales 'could exceed Dollars 5bn by 1996,
assuming no major disruptions to production and no supply or price shocks.'
It predicts that world diamond production, which rose by 19 per cent from
89.6m carats to 106.7m between 1986 and 1990, will grow by a further 15 per
cent, from 108m carats to 119m between 1992 and 1996.
Ironically, De Beers' own Venetia mine, near Messina in the northern
Transvaal, which is now building up production towards its expected annual
capacity of 4m carats, is the main contributor to the production increase.
The report says De Beers will have to absorb more diamonds into its buffer
stock and the market imbalance will be most marked in relatively low
quality, small diamonds which have already been accumulating at the CSO and
cutting centres since 1990.
The EIU expects the diamond cartel to survive, however, and even suggests
that its most testing time will come after the market revives 'and with it
the incentive for producers to break with the cartel, or at least to seek a
degree of independence.'

<HEAD>De Beers Raises Prices 15.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The De Beers diamond cartel of South Africa, citing
strong demand, says it is increasing prices for rough gemstones an
average 15.5 percent.
   The price increase for a broad range of uncut diamonds, announced
Tuesday, is effective next week. It follows a 13.5 percent increase
last May and a 10 percent increase in September 1987.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which is based in Johannesburg,
controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market through its
London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization.
   It does not disclose what the prices are.
   The cartel only sets prices for rough diamonds, which it doesn't
disclose, and operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in
South Africa and Australia to dealers and cutters in the world's
major diamond cutting centers, Antwerp, Bombay, New York and Tel
Aviv.
   It holds about 10 ``sights'' _ or sales _ for international
diamond dealers a year, with the next one scheduled for next week.
   ``We are responding to prevailing conditions in the market. It
was market-led,'' spokesman Richard Dickson said Thursday about the
price increase.
   Demand for rough diamonds of two carats and less is especially
strong, he said.
   ``The industry is anticipating another good year in 1989 from
retail diamond and jewelry sales,'' Dickson said.
   The generally weaker dollar has helped sales because diamonds are
priced in dollars and holders of Japanese yen and European
currencies get more for their money.
   In addition, sales should improve in Japan after April 1 when a
15 percent tax in Britain on luxury items costing about $300 or more
is replaced with a flat 3 percent sales tax on all items, Dickson
said.
   The markets in Israel and India are particularly strong, with
good advances also in New York and Belgium, he said.
   ``We are bringing rough prices up in line with those prices of
polished diamonds that are prevailing within the diamond cutting
centers,'' he said.
   The organization had record sales of $4.2 billion in 1988, up 37
percent from $3.08 billion in 1987, the previous record.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
primarily in drilling. Between 10 percent and 20 percent are gems.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (8): Girl's best
friend survives a crisis - Antwerp is still the diamond capital of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Pete Sampras swept to victory in the European Union tennis
championships in Antwerp this month, he picked up a rare first prize.
Instead of the standard cheque, Sampras, the world's number one tennis
player, won a diamond-encrusted racquet. It was a testimony to the
champion's heavyweight serve, but also to Antwerp's skill in promoting
itself as the diamond capital of Europe
After a sluggish 1992, Antwerp is bouncing back.
Revelling in its designated role this year as Europe's cultural capital, the
city has devised a succession of glittering events to showcase the diamond
trade, an industry whose roots in Flanders go back to the 17th century.
Perhaps the most eye-catching was the exhibition called 'From the Treasury'
which featured more than 10,000 carats of diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and
rubies. The jewels came from the Romanov family of Russia, Thurn and Taxis
of Germany, from the late Duchess of Windsor's collection and from other
distinguished families.
The three-week-long event attracted more than 175,000 visitors, a record for
Antwerp and a considerable boost to the local tourist industry. It took
place shortly after the 26th World Diamond Congress, whose principal message
was one of cautious optimism about the prospects for a revival for the
diamond trade in 1993/4.
In his keynote speech, Mr Julian Ogilvy-Thompson, chairman of De Beers
Centenary and De Beers Consolidated Mines, said that the diamond industry
had weathered a crisis which some outside commentators had predicted would
be terminal.
Prudent intervention by the Central Selling Organisation in London (CSO: the
body which regulates the distribution of rough diamonds) had helped to bring
supply and demand in the cutting centres more into balance. Confidence was
now returning to the trade, Mr Ogilvy-Thompson told delegates.
This view is reflected in the performance of the Belgian diamond market
which saw a strong expansion in the 1980s, followed by a period of
stabilisation between 1991-2. In the past six months, the market showed
signs of a revival.
The chief reasons for the improvement were a recovery in the US; a decline
in the supply of illegally mined diamonds from Angola (which continues to be
disrupted by the civil war); and preventive action by the CSO to deal with
dumping by Russian producers on key world markets.
The downside for the producers were tighter margins, cuts in production and
multiple lay-offs. In South Africa and Namibia, De Beers laid off 4000
people - about 25 per cent of its workforce.
The raw statistics tell a part of the story. Imports of diamonds rose from
65.6 per cent in weight to 87m carats. Measured by value, imports rose by 15
per cent to Dollars 4.4bn.
Exports showed the same degree of expansion, with volume increasing by 66
per cent to 66m carats. Exports by value rose by 14 per cent to Dollars
4.3bn, with an increase in polished diamond exports to the UK, Germany,
Italy, and France, despite the persistent weakness of the European economy.
As a result, the rise in turnover to 153.6m carats was markedly better than
the 92.6m achieved in the first of 1992; meanwhile, value increased
substantially from Dollars 7.6bn (1992) to Dollars 8.7bn. Of about 45m
carats of directly imported rough diamonds of gem quality, 25m - 56 per cent
 -come from the CSO in London.
Antwerp remains the world's most important distribution point for rough
diamonds, after the CSO.
It also boasts four of the world's 20 diamond bourses which together form
the Federation of Belgian Diamond Bourses: Diamantclub van Antwerpen (which
celebrated its centenary this year); Beurs voor Diamanathandel; Antwerpsche
Diamantkring; and the Vrije Diamanthandel.
Together, the total membership of the four bourses is nearly 6000, with more
than 1200 offices.
They have come a long way since the old polishing factories of the 1860s,
many of which were steam-driven. Today, electronic data processing has
transformed the operation of the diamond trade and industry, breaking down
distances and speeding up communications.
If there is a darker side to the new age, it is that Belgian's diamond
industry faces ever tougher competition, particularly from rival centres in
the Far East which can exploit lower wages and costs.
Smaller Belgian manufacturers are therefore pressing for regular supplies of
rough diamonds which are traded through Antwerp, while others are urging
younger members of the industry to come up with new technological
breakthroughs to improve competitiveness.
On the other hand, the Far East clearly offers enormous potential as a
consumer market, particularly in China.
Last February the Diamond High Council organised a visit to Asia which
included stops in the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong. Local traders in
Manila lobbied hard for deregulation of the industry in order to exploit its
potential as an important foreign exchange earner.
Mr Ogilvy-Thompson is cautiously optimistic about the future. But he warns:
'There will be no dramatic increase in business, until there is a resurgence
of world economic activity, and that, unfortunately, may still be up to a
year away.'
