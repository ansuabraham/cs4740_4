<TEXT>     Her neighborhood was leveled. The Tolentinos and 100 other poor families
along the Albacan River in Angeles, a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in
the shadow of Mount Pinatubo, lost their homes Saturday in mudslides and
floods brought on by the volcano's powerful eruption.;    One resident, an
elderly man, drowned in the torrent of thick volcanic ash and rainwater.;   
Because of impassable roads and downed telephone lines, it was still
impossible Monday to determine the extent of the damage.;    The death toll
from the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, combined with a series of earthquakes
and torrential rains, increased to more than 200, according to Philippine
television. The Philippine Red Cross said at least 101 people had been
killed.;    The government estimated damage to property and crops at about
$200 million.;    Most of the deaths occurred when houses and other buildings
collapsed under the weight of as much as eight inches of ash and sand spewed
from the rumbling crater.;    Hundreds of people across the island of Luzon
were reported missing, while hundreds of thousands of others have been left
homeless.;    As many as 150,000 people fleeing the volcano were said to be
crowding into evacuation centers Monday night in Manila, the capital, about 50
miles south of the volcano.;    Volcano scientists continued to express a
careful optimism. Raymondo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute
of Volcanology and Seismology, said in an interview that while the volcano
remained a threat, the eruptions were "simmering down" and "significant,
critical eruptions are probably over.";    Manila's domestic and international
airports were scheduled to reopen today, three days after they were closed
because of concern that ash from the volcano would damage jet engines.;   
Despite the optimism from scientists, however, the exodus of families fleeing
the volcano area continued late Monday as buses and trucks caked with gray ash
jammed roads leading into Manila. The government has set up more than 100
makeshift shelters in churches, schools, army camps and gymnasiums in the
capital.;    In the wake of the eruptions, Filipinos are facing monumental
tasks. Food and clean drinking water were running low in the central and
southwestern portions of the main Luzon island, which bore the brunt of the
volcano's week of fury.;    Angeles was without electricity Monday and so many
stores and gasoline stations were closed that it was difficult to find food
and fuel.;    Dozens of angry residents stormed a row of food shops in the
city's market, forced open the doors with crowbars and carted away canned
goods and other items, police and witnesses said.;    "We will die of hunger
if we don't do this," one of the looters said.;    Fifteen people were
arrested after more than 100 pigs were stolen from a farm near Angeles.;   
United States military officials said Monday that they were stepping up the
evacuation of 20,000 Americans, including the dependents of all employees at
the two huge U.S.-operated military bases, Clark and Subic Bay.;    Seven Navy
ships sailed Monday from Subic Bay, 50 miles northwest of Manila, with 6,200
dependents.;    "It's about time we left," said Lisa Hedland, wife of an Air
Force sergeant, as she prepared to board the cruiser Long Beach with her
15-month-old daughter. "It's been horrible this past week.";    The Navy said
a battle group led by the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln was on the way to
Subic Bay to pick up 5,000 more Americans.;    For most Filipinos fleeing the

41-year-old laundry worker from Angeles, who fled to a Manila evacuation

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly 19 miles high today in the
biggest eruption since it came to life this week. An approaching typhoon
threatened to trigger mudflows down the volcano.;    After sunset the volcano
erupted again, lighting up the night sky. Two streams of orange, glowing
material flowed from the crater.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEW THREAT: TYPHOON
IT MAY TRIGGER MUDFLOWS AS PHILIPPINE VOLCANO
ERUPTS AGAIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Scientists initially thought it was the first flow of lava in a week of
eruptions. But Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology, said the glow was actually an "incandescent
pyroclastic flow," hot gases, stones and ash that travel at high speeds and
are an even greater threat than lava.;    As if the volcano were not enough,
the Manila weather bureau reported today that a typhoon was headed for the
eastern coast of Luzon island with maximum winds of 110 miles per hour.;   
Typhoon Yunya was expected to come ashore late Saturday or Sunday near Baler,
90 miles northeast of Mount Pinatubo. Heavy rain began falling today in Manila
and central Luzon.;    If the typhoon brings more rain, scientists fear it
will unleash mudflows -- giant rivers of earth, boulders and debris fused
together with sticky volcanic ash.;    Kelvin Rodolfo, a Filipino-American
geology professor from the University of Illinois-Chicago, said mudflows
represented one of the most serious dangers from Mount Pinatubo because they
could bury towns and settlements quickly under tons of debris.;    At least
four people died; four were missing and 24 injured since Pinatubo began
erupting Sunday after being dormant for 600 years, officials said. About
79,000 people, including 15,000 Americans, have been evacuated.;    The
thunderous explosions today spewed ash over a wide area, including the
evacuated Clark Air Base 10 miles east of the volcano and Subic Bay naval base
25 miles to the southwest, where the Clark personnel are being temporarily
housed.;    At Clark, the remaining 1,500 U.S. service members guarding the
installation donned goggles and surgical masks.;    The mayor of Olongapo,
Richard Gordon, urged residents to stay indoors because ash was falling like a
hailstorm and had accumulated up to three inches deep. Subic Bay naval base is
located next to Olongapo.;    The volcano's fallout made the town look "like
nighttime" in midafternoon, correspondent Louella Vizcocho said by telephone.;
   Mount Pinatubo had been calm more than 24 hours after a major eruption
Thursday morning that shot ash more than 15 miles high, but scientists had
said pressure was intensifying within the 4,795-foot volcano.;    Then at
least four blasts within 2 1/2 hours of each other occurred today, sending ash
nearly 19 miles high.;    The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and
Seismology said the fourth blast was the largest of 10 eruptions since
Sunday.;    During the evening eruption, seismologist Julio Sabit said the sky
darkened and then dramatically lit up.;    "The fireworks of Pinatubo began,"
the excited Sabit said by radio.;    Radio reporters at the scene said the
spectacle cast a gentle, orange glow over the summit of the volcano. "It's
very beautiful," reporter Vic Lima said. "There's a stream of orange flow on
the two sides of the volcano.";    About 64,000 people have been evacuated,
most of them since major eruptions began on Wednesday. Food was reported
running low at refugee camps.;    Police said 12 people have been arrested for
allegedly looting parts of Clark Air Base, which nearly 15,000 Americans and
their families evacuated last Monday.;    Many of the Americans expressed
concern for the safety of their belongings, but Air Force officials assured
them that the 1,500 security guards would be sufficient to protect homes and
barracks.;    The Office of Civil Defense said that at least four people have
been killed in eruptions this week. Unofficial reports by local officials and
survivors put the death toll at 10.;    Rescue agencies said they were still
trying to confirm the unofficial reports and some or all of these may be added
to official counts later.;    At least 24 people were injured and four were
missing, the civil defense agency said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than
12 miles high, and a typhoon brought heavy rain that could unleash tons of
debris from the jagged slopes.;    Seven explosions were recorded from the
4,800-foot tropical volcano today, and scientists said more were expected.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Typhoon Yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of
Luzon island, which includes Mount Pinatubo, early in the day. But it quickly
weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered
about 70 miles east of the volcano.;    Still, heavy rains churned up by the
typhoon drenched Manila and the provinces near the volcano, raising fears of
mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away.;    Meanwhile,
President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans
had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages
nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base, abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000
Americans.;    The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000
Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard
of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a
third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.;    Showers of
'mud drops';  "It looks like it's snowing outside," said military spokeswoman
Capt. Kim Urie. Headlights and street lamps were turned on at midafternoon as
a "dark, black cloud" passed over the giant Navy base and dropped a gritty
rain of "mud drops," she said.;    At least four people have died, 24 have
been hurt and four have been listed as missing since Pinatubo began erupting
Sunday, after lying dormant for six centuries, officials said. About 84,000
people, including Americans, have been evacuated.;    Police said 12 people
had been arrested for looting at Clark.;    Five explosions shook the mountain
early today, showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular
pre-dawn display of nature's fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and
rain.;    Friday, eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam
nearly 19 miles high.;    Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles
east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel
had been temporarily housed. Gray ash also fell in Manila, 60 miles south.;   
At Subic, base spokesman Robert Coble said generators had to be shut down from
time to time to clean out volcanic ash, plunging the base into darkness.;   
River temperatures rising;  Temperatures in local rivers were rising because
of the volcanic debris, officials said.;    After sunset, the volcano spewed
two streams of orange, glowing material from its crater in what scientists
thought was the first appearance of lava during the weeklong eruptions.;   
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and
Seismology, said Friday's blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest
since Mount Pinatubo awoke Sunday from its 600-year slumber.;    A British
newspaper, the Guardian, reported Thursday that the Americans declared a
nuclear alert at Clark late Wednesday and informed governments in Manila and
Hong Kong that "a nuclear accident in the region was possible." But Aquino
told reporters the story was "baseless and purely fabricated.";    The United
States refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the
Philippines.;    Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the eruption
should have no effect on talks on the future of Clark and Subic, where leases
expire Sept. 16. The talks are deadlocked over compensation and the duration
of a new agreement.;    Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo could remain active
for years if it follows the pattern of similar Philippine volcanoes. That
would leave Clark unusable.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Thousands of U.S. Air Force personnel were given orders to leave today and the

predicted possible new eruptions on Mount Pinatubo.;    Fears of new eruptions
and landslides again drove Filipinos from their homes today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     About 3,000 Americans sailed from Subic Bay Naval Base aboard the aircraft
carrier Abraham Lincoln bound for Cebu, where they will catch flights to the
United States.;    "I can't wait to get out of here," Tess Machinsky, 44, of
Seattle, said as she prepared to board the Abraham Lincoln. "This place is a
mess.";    The U.S. Embassy said all 20,000 military family members have now
left Subic. The naval base's population swelled by nearly 15,000 when the Air
Force evacuated troops and dependents from Clark Air Base on June 10 after the
nearby volcano began erupting for the first time in more than 600 years.;   
An Air Force spokesman, Maj. Wayne Crist, also announced that 4,500 air
personnel would begin loading later today aboard the carrier Midway in a move
that would reduce Air Force troops by more than 60 percent.;    At Clark, 10
miles east of the volcano, people who toured the base today said flows of hot
rocks, gas and other volcanic debris had reached within 300 feet of Clark's
Mactan housing area. The flow was still smoking today.;    Mount Pinatubo was
quiet after seven small ash eruptions Thursday, but a government expert said
tremors suggest eruptions could occur.;    "We are recognizing some long
tremor periods and earthquakes, and this means that some magma is again moving
to the surface," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.;    He said it was impossible to
predict when new eruptions could begin.;    Many Filipinos who had returned to
their homes after the volcano quieted down began leaving again today, worried
by the eruption prediction and fearing heavy rains may unleash tons of debris
from the volcano's slopes.;    Two weeks of eruptions on the 4,795-foot
volcano, about 60 miles north of Manila, has claimed at least 268 lives.;   
Rivers in central Luzon were reported rising today as volcanic ash washed into
the streams after two days of steady rains. In Capas, near the volcano, police
said three refugee children were swept away by floodwaters Thursday and feared
dead.;    Roy David, mayor of Porac west of Angeles, said he had urged
residents who fled to evacuation centers not to return home because of the
rising Porac River. He estimates about 80 percent of the town's 68,000
residents have fled since June 9 when eruptions began.;    "Mudflows have
already cascaded down the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, and the silt in the Porac
River is steadily rising," he said.;    Jose Pangilinan, a resident of Angeles
City adjacent to Clark, said he was returning his wife and two children to his
relatives' home in nearby Apalit town.;    "I can't take chances; it could be
real bad," Pangilinan said. He said he returned to his home in Angeles last
Wednesday to inspect damage from a huge mudflow that roared through city
streets before dawn last Sunday.;    Richard Gordon, major of Olongapo, said a
landslide along a major highway leading to the city near Subic was preventing
supplies from reaching the more than 300,000 residents.;    "If we cannot pass
through that landslide, we cannot supply goods to Olongapo (and other towns),"
Gordon said.;    About 1,500 air personnel will remain to guard Clark, and
1,000 others will stay at the Subic Bay Naval Base, said Navy spokesman Lt.
Cmdr. Kevin Mukri.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  About 15,000 U.S. service members, dependents and civilians were ordered early
today to evacuate Clark Air Base, one of the largest U.S. bases overseas,
after a Philippine volcano dormant for six centuries began exploding with
searing gases, thick ash and deadly debris.;    Lt. Col. Ron Rand, a spokesman
at Clark, announced at 5 a.m. that all non-essential personnel should begin
evacuating the sprawling base as dawn skies over central Luzon were filled
with gray ash and steam from eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, about 10 miles away
in central Luzon.  </LEADPARA>

IN PHILIPPINES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Rand said that Americans who live on or near the base would drive or be
bused to the U.S-operated Subic Bay Naval Base, about an hour's drive to the
southwest. The evacuation was to take four hours, he said.;    There was no
indication how long the Americans would stay, but they were ordered to take
along important papers and three days worth of food, water and clothing.;   
Philippines officials earlier had ordered the evacuation of more than 11,000
people from about 20 villages near the volcano, about 60 miles northwest of
Manila, after a series of small eruptions began Friday. No injuries were
reported over the weekend.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said, however, that two
moderate eruptions shortly before 3 p.m. Sunday appeared to signal a larger
explosion.;    "We're expecting a major eruption," he said in a telephone
interview early today. "We're just at the beginning stage of eruptions. We're
expecting many, many more.";    Punongbayan said that the 4,795-foot-high
volcano was spewing gases up to 1,800 degrees, thick black ash, boulders and
rock fragments in two fast-moving streams from two vents on the western side
of the lower summit.;    "It's very dangerous," he said. "Anything along its
path will be destroyed.";    Clouds and ashes;  Sunday's eruptions sent a
dense cloud of steam and ash billowing thousands of feet above rice paddies
that are lush green from an impending harvest. Heavy black clouds shrouded the
mountain, and a blanket of gray ash covered nearby fields. Debris reportedly
was sprayed as far as the South China Sea, 20 miles to the west.;    Villagers
from a 12-mile radius of the mountain fled the area on foot and water buffalo,
and aboard crowded trucks and jitneys. The Philippines Red Cross said 11,024
people, including local Aeta aborigines, were evacuated to 18 disaster relief
centers set up at area schools, but officials said that many villagers stayed
behind to protect their animals and farms from looters.;    Rand said the
evacuation of Clark was ordered "due to a slight increase of volcanic
activity" overnight. All U.S. Air Force planes had moved from the base to Cubi
Point Naval Air Station near Subic on Sunday, and infants in the base's
neo-natal hospital and other patients had been flown out.;    Evacuation
rehearsal;  All military personnel at Clark, home of the 13th Air Force, were
recalled to the base Sunday afternoon, and U.S. officials ordered local
Americans to pack bags and rehearse evacuation procedures.;    "People are
pretty calm," said one American woman who lives on the base. "People are
prepared.";    Rand said that a minimal number of troops would remain at Clark
to guard the facility and maintain essential services. Marines from Subic as
well as Philippines and U.S. military police were deployed along the road to
provide security.;    The volcano began showing signs of activity in April for
the first time in 600 years, and last week it began belching small amounts of
steam and smoke. Seismologists reported a marked increase in volcanic tremors
last week, with intense seismic quakes on the mountain Friday.;     Last
eruption;  Mount Pinatubo last erupted in 1380, 141 years before Ferdinand
Magellan, a Portuguese explorer flying the flag of Spain, first reached the
islands in search of spices.;    There are about 21 active and 200 dormant
volcanoes in the Philippines, which sits on the "Ring of Fire" that circles
the Pacific Ocean. Scientists said there was no connection, however, to the
eruption last Monday of Japan's Mount Unzen, which killed at least 37 people
on Kyushu Island. A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris erupted there Saturday,
setting 73 homes on fire.;    Nearly 10,000 people have left their homes at
the foot of Mount Unzen, and two naval ships stood by to take residents
farther away in case a new eruption sent lava, hot rocks and ash over a yet
wider area.  </TEXT>

of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic.;    The decision to evacuate one
of the largest overseas U.S. military bases was made early today after searing

<TEXT>     The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week
after six centuries of dormancy. No casualties have been reported, but experts
are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon.;    Gases, ash and
molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in
thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet.;    The Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground
movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of
the craters.;    Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo
was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."; 
  He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from
Clark. But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600
years ago, the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark.;
   Rains fell across the area Sunday night, and officials warned residents in
the lush, green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to
escape mud flows.;    Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand announced the
evacuation in a 5 a.m. broadcast over the U.S. military's Far East Network. An
hour later, the first vehicles began rolling out of Clark for the U.S.-run
Subic Bay naval base, where the 14,500 troops, dependents and civilian
employees will be housed until the danger passes. Another 1,500 troops
remained at Clark to provide security.;    The Clark command center operated
with a skeletal crew, but the base's operations were suspended. The base is a
major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the Military
Airlift Command.;    The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading
to Subic, about 50 miles southwest of Clark. U.S. Marines patrolled the
highways, which pass through areas where Communist guerrillas operate, and
U.S. helicopters hovered overhead.;    By late afternoon, U.S. officials said
all the evacuees had reached Subic.;    "If it's going to blow, I hope it does
it fast so I can go home before the cockroaches take my house," said Staff
Sgt. Mike Huffman.;    Clark Air Base is in Angeles, a city of more than
300,000 people about 50 miles north of Manila. In Angeles, residents reported
no ash fell today but said the air smelled of sulfur.;    In southern Japan
today, Mount Unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks, and heavy
rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week,
raising fears of deadly mudslides.;    Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano
covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against
possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police
said.;    An explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks from the mountain
one week ago claimed 38 lives, and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens
more homes. In all, about 9,800 people have been evacuated from communities at
the foot of the mountain, said police in Nagasaki, 30 miles away.;    Mount
Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific
where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other, triggering
periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.;    In the Philippines, officials
have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces since Mount Pinatubo
began erupting last week. About 3,100 of them are primitive Aeta tribes people
who lived on Pinatubo's slopes.;    Many of them walked or traveled by ox cart
to flee the volcano. But reporters found that some evacuees are returning to
their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to
evacuation centers at sundown.;    Punongbayan said he flew to the area and
warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins.; 
  There was no indication how long the Americans evacuated from Clark would
stay at Subic, but they were ordered to take along important papers and food,
water and clothing for three days.;    Subic base spokesman Bob Coble said
families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that
others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters.;    Mount
Pinatubo, which last had a major eruption in 1380, began to show signs of
activity in April. Last week, it belched small amounts of steam and ash.;   
There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The
last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles
south of Manila, exploded. About 200 people were killed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Residents of nearby Angeles panicked when a huge, gray-greenish mushroom
cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night. Thousands of fleeing
people packed roads.;    "Stones as big as my head were falling down from the
mountains," said Rolly Soria, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said
Manuel Romualdo. "Children were crying. We had to grab whatever we could.";   
Scientists warned of more, possibly larger eruptions from the 4,795-foot
volcano, which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in
April.;    "This could be only the beginning," said Raymundo Punongbayan,
director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.;   
Angeles, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to Clark Air Base, but authorities had
not ordered a general evacuation there.;    Hundreds of Americans fled Clark,
home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most of the
base's residents had been evacuated Monday. The base did not appear
immediately threatened by volcanic flow.;    Seismologists said searing gas,
ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountain's western and
northern slopes. They said most of the debris flowed into the Marella,
Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property
or homes had been damaged.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman, descendants of the
original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of Mount Pinatubo.;  
 At a refugee center in Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors
told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed
by a rain of ash.;    They said they scampered for safety with their
belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall, many wearing
cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by
the eruption," television reporter Bert Basa said. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights and
windshield wipers on.;    A photographer who circled the volcano in an
airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was covered with ash, as were
mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush, green tropical peaks.;   
Today's first eruption began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent
forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes
later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume could be
seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene said it
blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China Sea.;   
Two more thundering explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo late today.;    The
Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said the explosions
occurred at 10:52 p.m. and 11:05 p.m. The second explosion sent a plume of ash
and steam 80,000 feet into the sky.;    Shortly after midnight, a sixth
explosion was reported.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of
built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The
crisis has not ended yet," said Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology. "We have signs that the volcano is preparing for
another one.";    Punongbayan warned people within a 15-mile radius of
Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the
sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas said in a broadcast from Botolan, near
the volcano's western slopes. He said strong tremors preceded the nighttime
eruptions and continued afterward.;    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few
belongings Monday moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval
base, 50 miles to the southwest.;    Clark is one of the biggest U.S. bases
overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was in the path of the
volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380.;   
About 19,000 Filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near
the volcano's slopes and were housed in 25 makeshift evacuation centers
outside the projected danger zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated
after today's eruption.;    About 10 people in Moraza, a village on the
western slope of the mountain, were refusing to leave, relief officials said.
They told rescuers that they would not leave their livestock and if the
animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2, Pinatubo produced a
small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water meeting hot rocks
deep inside. On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild eruption.;    That
same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an explosion of
superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    Experts say there
is apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  U.S. officials Sunday launched an emergency evacuation to the United States of
about 20,000 military dependents and civilian workers from two strategic bases
after a deadly 36-hour string of eruptions at Mount Pinatubo.;    At least 76
people have been killed since the volcano began erupting June 9 for the first
time in 600 years, the Red Cross said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The first 900 of the evacuees boarded U.S. warships Sunday at Subic Bay
Naval Station and departed for Cebu, a southern Philippine city about 350
miles from Manila, where they were scheduled to board planes for the United
States.;    Even as the evacuation order was issued, Philippine volcano
scientists said that the worst of Mount Pinatubo's eruptions may be over,
despite a prediction Saturday that the volcano was on the verge of a major
explosion.;    The scientists said that much of the pressure built up in the
volcano had dissipated this weekend in the emission of vast clouds of ash and
rock that turned day to night across the island of Luzon, and in a series of
earthquakes, including one that rocked skyscrapers in downtown Manila on
Sunday.;    The ash combined with rain from a tropical storm Saturday and left
a slippery glaze on buildings and roads as far away as Manila, about 50 miles
south of the volcano.;    Panicked residents of villages close to the volcano
trudged on foot through knee-deep ash Saturday to escape the rumbling volcano.
Mudslides washed out bridges, clogged highways and caused hundreds of homes to
collapse.;    The international and domestic airports in the capital remained
closed Sunday out of concern that the ash would damage jet engines.;    Last
week, the Pentagon announced that about 7,000 dependents of military and
civilian workers at the U.S.-run Clark Air Base would be evacuated from the
Philippines to the United States. Clark, one of the largest American military
bases outside the United States, is 10 miles east of the volcano and has been
shut down since last Monday.;    Sunday's expanded evacuation order includes
all civilian workers at Clark and at Subic Bay, as well as all dependents from
both installations.;    "The only ones left will be uniformed Army, Air Force,
Navy or Marine personnel," said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, a spokesman at Subic.
"You'll have to be in uniform to stay.";    Workers to remain at Subic;   
Military officials said that about 12,000 uniformed military workers were
stationed at the bases before the volcano erupted, and that most would remain
behind at Subic while their families and the civilian employees left the
Philippines.;    Virtually all of the 16,000 base workers at Clark and their
family members were evacuated to Subic Bay last week.;    The chief spokesman
at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Stanley Schrager, said the evacuation had been
ordered because "it's just untenable to have 30,000 people at Subic, double
the ordinary population, especially given the uncertainty over the volcano and
over the future of Clark as to when these people would be able to go home.";  
 On Sunday, Clark looked like a vast moonscape, with about six inches of
concrete-like volcanic ash covering roads, roofs and runways. Ragged scrubland
and manicured lawns had the same bleak blanket of hard gray crust.;    'A
wasteland';    "Everything looks like a wasteland," said Philippine Brig. Gen.
Leopoldo Acot Jr., commander of about 150 Philippine troops guarding the
nearly deserted base.;    On Saturday, volcanic ash and a hail of inch-long
pebbles emitted by Mount Pinatubo shut down operations at Subic Bay and
damaged about 100 buildings, half of them seriously.;    Two people -- a
9-year-old American girl and a Filipino -- were reported killed late Saturday
when the roof of their shelter at Subic collapsed under the weight of the
ash.;    "We don't have snow here, and the roofs are not designed to hold
anything," Mukri said. "You get an event like this only about every 600 years.
It's not something you plan for.";    In the city of Olongapo, near the Subic
base, eight people were reported killed when the roof of a hospital collapsed
late Saturday because of ash deposits. Six people died when a church collapsed
in Dau, near Clark.;    Readiness unaffected;    U.S. officials said the
evacuation of base workers from Clark and Subic would not affect military
readiness in the Pacific. All jet fighters had been withdrawn from Clark in
recent months as a result of a global redeployment of forces by the Pentagon.;
   But the volcano is expected to affect the final round of negotiations
between the United States and the Philippines over an extension of the joint
lease for the two bases, which expires in September. U.S. officials say Clark
may not be able to assume normal operations for months, if not years.;   
There appears to be no similar doubt about the future of Subic, which could
reopen fully within the next few weeks.;    Philippine scientists said Sunday
it appeared that a section of the crater on Mount Pinatubo had collapsed on
itself, releasing pressure that might otherwise have produced a cataclysmic
avalanche of molten rock.;    Forecast withdrawn;  On Saturday, the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology had predicted such an explosion after
obtaining satellite photos showing a nearly two-mile fissure along the
southern edge on the volcano. But Sunday it withdrew the ominous forecast.;   
The evacuation from Subic began Sunday afternoon, when 900 Americans, mostly
wives and children from Clark, boarded the cruiser Arkansas and two frigates,
the Rodney M. Davies and the Kurtz, bound for Cebu.;    Military officials
said the evacuees would probably be flown by chartered jets from the
international airport at Cebu to an American air base on Guam, and, from
there, to the United States. Plans to evacuate the Americans by plane from the
Cubi Point naval air station, which adjoins Subic Bay, were foiled by the
ash.;    The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, leading a battle group out
of Okinawa on the way to the Persian Gulf, is to assist in the evacuation,
which is expected to last a week to 10 days, U.S. officials said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The U.S. Air Force decided today to withdraw more than 60 percent of its
personnel from the Philippines because of damage to Clark Air Base from the
Mount Pinatubo volcano.;    The decision to withdraw the bulk of the Air Force
personnel suggests that damage to Clark, where they had been stationed, is
extensive and that it may take months before the facility can be used.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VOLCANO CAUSES MORE TROOPS TO LEAVE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Until today, the evacuation of Americans from the Philippines affected
primarily military dependents.;    Mount Pinatubo spewed more ash over Clark,
which is 10 miles away, and other areas during five eruptions today, and
regional officials raised the death toll from last week's massive explosions
to 227.;    Also today, all flights in and out of Manila's airport were
canceled for the day so workers could spread asphalt over tons of ash piled
along the runway shoulders.;    The U.S. evacuation announcement does not
affect Navy and Marine Corps personnel stationed at Subic Bay naval base 25
miles southwest of the volcano.;    U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager
said 4,500 Air Force personnel will board ships Friday at Subic and travel
south to Cebu, where they will board flights for the United States.;    That
will leave 2,500 airmen in the Philippines -- 1,500 at Clark and another 1,000
at Subic.;    The 1,500 airmen at Clark were left behind to guard the base
when the other 15,000 American soldiers and their families evacuated to Subic
on June 10, a day after Mount Pinatubo began erupting, ending 600 years of
dormancy.;    The U.S. military announced on Sunday that Air Force family
members would be evacuated to the United States and then later expanded the
withdrawal to include families of Navy and defense department civilians as
well.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo erupted with three thundering explosions today, shooting a
giant plume of ash more than 12 miles high and chasing nearby residents away
with an outpouring of molten rock and hot gas.;    A Filipino serving with the

VOLCANO ON A RAMPAGE
ASH FILLS THE SKY; LAVA, GAS GUSH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Residents of nearby Angeles panicked at the roar of the initial blast, and
thousands of people packed roads after a huge gray-greenish mushroom cloud
burst from the volcano and turned day to night.;    At a refugee center in
Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing
dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash.;   
"Stones as big as my head were falling down from the mountains," said Rolly
Soria, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said Manuel Romualdo, who fled
with his wife, five children, a cat and a dog. "Children were crying. We had
to grab whatever we could.";    Scientists warned of more, possibly larger
eruptions from the 4,795-foot volcano, which was dormant for six centuries
until it began spewing steam in April.;    "This could only be the beginning,"
said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology
and Seismology.;    Tens miles to the east, hundreds of Americans fled Clark
Air Base, home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most
of the base's residents had been evacuated Monday.;    Clark did not appear
threatened by volcanic flow, and there were no immediate reports of
casualties.;    Seismologists said searing gas, ash and molten rock raced at
great speed down the mountain's western and northern slopes and into the
Marella, Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman,
descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of
Mount Pinatubo.;    People scampered for safety with their belongings and
livestock over roads slippery with ash fall. Refugees wore cardboard boxes to
protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by the eruption,"
reporter Bert Basa said by telephone from Angeles. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights on and
wipers operating to clear the windshields of volcanic debris. Bits of ash
wafted across the roads as if along a windy beach.;    A photographer who
circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was
covered with ash, as were mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush,
green tropical peaks that now looked like the Alps in winter.;    Today's
eruptions began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent forth a
mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and
a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume 12 1/2 miles high
could be seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene
said it blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China
Sea.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even
more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The crisis has not ended," said
Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. "We
have signs that the volcano is preparing for another one.";    Punongbayan
warned people within a 12-mile radius of Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is
very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas
said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the volcano's western slopes. "It's
just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    Moments after the first explosion, sirens
wailed at Clark Air Base, and 600 of the 1,500 Americans remaining there fled
eastward to safety. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said 900 Americans,
mostly security personnel, remained at the 130,000-acre base.;    Clark is one
of the biggest U.S. bases overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was
in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major
eruption, in 1380.;    The Pentagon, which is trying to negotiate a new
contract with Manila for the base, said it can work around the temporary loss
of Clark.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few belongings on Monday
moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles to
the southwest.;    Although the Air Force left Clark, Philippine authorities
have not ordered a general evacuation of Angeles, a city of more than 300,000
people adjacent to the base.;    When Mount Pinatubo erupted today, church
bells pealed to sound the alarm and many people froze in their tracks with
fear. Many scampered for safety indoors.;    About 19,000 Filipinos had
earlier been evacuated from three provinces near the volcano's slopes and were
housed in about 25 makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger
zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated after today's eruption but they
could provide no new figures.;    In the Sapang Bato area of Angeles, the city
district nearest the volcano, just 2,000 of 13,000 residents had been
evacuated as of Monday, officials said.;    Reporters visiting the village
today found it abandoned except for a few chickens and cattle. Houses were
padlocked, but the explosion had shattered some windows.;    Private jeep and
bus companies were ordered to the area today to pick up stragglers. About 10
people in Moraza, a village on the western slope, were refusing to leave,
relief officials said. They told rescuers that they would not leave their
livestock and if the animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2,
Pinatubo produced a small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water
meeting hot rocks deep inside.;    On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild
eruption. That same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an
explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    A
larger flow days later razed dozens of houses.;    Experts say there is
apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Once the United States' largest overseas air base, this strategic military
installation may be crippled permanently, U.S. officials said Sunday as damage
reports continued to increase from last week's devastating eruption of Mount
Pinatubo.;    A six-hour tour of Clark showed that the eruption spewed a
deadly torrent of superheated gas, rocks and mud up to 20 feet high down a
river valley only a few hundred yards behind an officers' housing complex and
elementary school. It also sent waist-deep mud and swirling water across parts
of the base, damaging the hospital and washing cars and trucks away.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VOLCANO DAMAGE RAISES DOUBTS U.S. CAN USE
AIR BASE AGAIN
ERUPTIONS COULD CONTINUE FOR 3 YEARS, SCIENTISTS
SAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At least 30 huge aircraft hangers, warehouses, a gymnasium and other
buildings were crushed from heavy gray ash that blankets runways, roads and
rooftops up to a foot deep in places. Falling trees damaged homes, a school
and other structures.;    With 10 new volcanic explosions Sunday, new ash
continues to rain down on Clark, only 8.6 miles away. Worse, scientists say
Pinatubo may remain active and dangerous for up to three years, spewing
volcanic debris that endangers lives, threatens aircraft and fouls sensitive
communications equipment.;    "It'll take a long time to get Clark back and
operating, if ever," Stanley Schrager, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Manila,
said Sunday.;    Lt. Col. Ron Rand, a Clark spokesman, said it was not clear
whether the Air Force ever could use runways and fly so close to an erupting
volcano. The ash is much finer than the desert sand that pilots overcame
during the Persian Gulf war.;    Moreover, the giant "pyroclastic flow" of
searing gas, steam and mud that roared at least 10 miles down the Sacobia
River, a short walk behind dozens of now ash-covered homes, broken trees and
the partially collapsed Grissom Elementary School in Clark's Mactan housing
complex, indicates that the base is directly endangered by future eruptions.; 
  The Pentagon temporarily has transferred some of the base's essential
operations -- including training, airlift capability and special operations --
to other bases in the Western Pacific, particularly Guam and Okinawa.
Officials say the transfers may become permanent if the base is deemed
inoperable.;    No precise figures are available, but damage and cleanup from
the June 15 eruption is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars at
Clark and the equally stricken Subic Bay Naval Base and dockyard, where more
than 122 buildings were badly damaged or destroyed.;    Subic's activities may
be temporarily relocated as well, officials said, but no decision has been
made yet. Subic is less likely to close permanently, however, since its ship
repair, refueling and resupply facilities are easier to maintain.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo spewed a deadly cloud of ash and gas more than 15 1/2 miles
high today after a turbulent night in which the volcano shook with the most
intense fury since it awoke from six centuries of sleep.;    "What we are

<HEADLINE>  ASH AND GAS ARE SPEWED IN 'PHENOMENAL' ERUPTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Two deaths reported;  Two deaths have been reported from the eruptions,
which began Sunday.;    A Filipino serving in the U.S. Navy was killed
Wednesday when his car skidded on an ash-slickened road north of the Subic Bay
naval base, 30 miles southwest of the volcano, and crashed into a bus.;    A
member of the Aeta tribe that lives on the slopes of Pinatubo, said he saw his
uncle die in an eruption Wednesday. There was no official confirmation, but
the man himself was badly burned.;    The latest eruption occurred at 8:41
a.m. today and lasted for a half hour. It unleashed giant mudflows down the
jagged, ash-covered western slopes of the 4,795-foot mountain and into the
Marella River.;    The eruption sent a gray avalanche of deadly ash, gases and
molten rock down the slopes. The billowing ash cloud above turned day to
dusk.;    Debris from the eruption covered the roads, and huge boulders, some
the size of cars, littered gullies and riverbeds.;    Ash fell as far as
Olongapo, 25 miles to the southwest.;    Aviation authorities warned airline
pilots to avoid flying near the volcano after a Saudi Airlines 747 developed
engine trouble Wednesday when it passed near the ash cloud en route to Manila
from Dhahran.;    The plane landed safely and an inspection showed volcanic
ash in the engines, according to air controller Roserene Reyes.;    Today's
eruption followed a violent night in which the volcano exploded with a fury,
first at 10:52 p.m., then again a short time later and a third time at 12:04
a.m. today.;    "This is already the big bang," Punongbayan said. "I can't see
any other eruption that will exceed this. What we are seeing now are
phenomenal eruptions.";    Another seismologist with the institute, Delfin
Garcia, said the volcano was entering "an episode of big eruptions" that would
continue indefinitely.;    Wednesday's eruptions began at 8:40 a.m. with a
tremendous blast that sent forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second
explosion a few minutes later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;   
After the nighttime eruptions, the troops that remained at nearby Clark Air
Base, from which most personnel were evacuated on Monday, prepared to
evacuate.;    About 100 vehicles lined up near the main gate and restless
troops milled about clutching their duffel bags, but no evacuation order was
issued.;    In the city of Angeles, which is adjacent to Clark, the more than
300,000 residents spent an anguished night, fearful the volcano might force
them to flee. Many residents packed emergency kits with clothes and provisions
and stored them in their cars so they could leave at a moment's notice.;   
Thousands evacuated;  In all, more than 35,000 people have been evacuated from
areas near the volcano since it began showing signs of activity last week.
They include thousands of primitive Aeta tribesmen, who fled Wednesday on
buffaloes and ox-drawn carts after large rocks rained down on them.;    Aetas
who were evacuated to refugee centers in Olongapo appeared to have been upset
by the ordeal. Many spoke of the ground shaking furiously before the huge
volcanic clouds appeared.;    "It's very hard for us when the ground shakes,"
said Vilma David, 32. "Why doesn't it end so we can go home?"  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo erupted today for a third straight day, shooting a cloud of gas
and steam more than 15 miles high, and an approaching typhoon threatened to
unleash tons of debris and boulders from the slopes of the rumbling volcano.; 
  Sirens blared at Clark Air Base, 10 miles east of Pinatubo, moments after
the volcano's latest eruption. Hundreds of U.S. troops milled about near the
gates, but no evacuation order was immediately issued.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VOLCANO ERUPTS 3RD TIME
ONCOMING TYPHOON THREATENS MUDFLOWS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Geologists said earlier today that new activity was imminent because
pressure was building inside the 4,795-foot volcano 60 miles north of the
capital, Manila.;    As though the volcano were not enough trouble, the Manila
weather bureau reported today that a typhoon was headed for the eastern coast
of Luzon island with maximum winds of 110 miles per hour. Typhoon Yunya is
expected to reach land late Saturday near Baler, about 90 miles northeast of
Mount Pinatubo. Rain already was falling today in Manila and Luzon.;    If the
typhoon brings more rain, scientists fear that it will unleash mudflows --
giant rivers of earth, boulders and debris fused with sticky volcanic ash.;   
Meanwhile, administration officials in Washington said Thursday that damage
from the volcano could cause the Bush administration to reduce or pull back
its offers for the continued use of the strategic U.S. military bases in the
Philippines.;    "If Clark Air Base is unuseful to us, they (Philippine
officials) will pay the price for their decision (to balk at recent U.S.
offers)," said an administration official, who has closely followed the
negotiations.;    At the moment, he said, the United States would not sign a
new agreement even if the Philippine government fully accepted the most recent
offer for the bases, the mainstay of U.S. military power in Southeast Asia.;  
 Rather, this official said, the United States wants to wait, at least
briefly, to see how much damage the volcano would cause to Clark and the Subic
Bay Naval Station. The eruption "could, in the extreme, render (Clark Air
Base) inoperative for jet aircraft," the administration official said.;    The
U.S. officials spoke on condition that they not be identified.;    This
spring, after a year of negotiations, the Bush administration and Philippine
officials had been moving toward an agreement that would permit continued U.S.
use of Clark and Subic Bay for at least seven more years. The current base
leases expire Sept. 16.;    However, at the end of the last round of talks in
May, the two sides still remained deadlocked on several issues.  </TEXT>

today. The bases' leases expire Sept. 16.;    The talks were suspended two
months before the volcano began erupting June 9, forcing the U.S. military to
evacuate more than 17,000 dependents and troops from Clark and Subic.;   
Pinatubo continued spewing ash today, and scientists fear the onset of the
rainy season will unleash devastating avalanches because of tons of debris on
the volcano's slopes.;    More than 1,000 people fled their homes today
several miles to the north and northeast of Clark to escape volcanic debris,
boulders and uprooted trees washed down a river by heavy rains. Scores more
were ordered evacuated.;    Scientists say the volcano could continue erupting
for up to three years.;    U.S. officials have made it clear that the
continuing threat posed by the volcano leaves the bases' future in doubt. But
Manglapus said Manila may demand even more money to renew the leases.;    Last
month, Manglapus said he would not reduce the compensation demand despite
damage to Clark and may actually press for more because "we suffered more than
the Americans.";    He also suggested last week that if Washington wants to
return Clark, it should first clean up the damage from Mount Pinatubo.;   
Armitage said he had indicated to Manglapus that the future of Clark is
"questionable" and noted that continuing emissions of ash would pose a hazard
to aviation at the air base.  </TEXT>

SIX MILES HIGH
DAMAGES AT CLARK AIR BASE ESTIMATED TO BE
$300 MILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Philippine officials said preliminary estimates showed Clark Air Base alone
suffered $300 million in damage since nearby Mount Pinatubo began erupting
June 9 for the first time in 600 years.;    The government sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said they were given the $300 million figure by
American officials, who told them talks on a new lease for U.S. bases in the
Philippines must wait until surveys are completed.;    The U.S. Embassy was
closed today for a municipal holiday, and U.S. officials could not be reached
for comment.;    The lease on Clark and the other U.S. bases expires Sept. 16.
Talks on an extension had bogged down -- before the eruptions -- over how much
Washington must pay and how long the installations can remain.;    Pinatubo's
eruptions have blanketed the countryside with deep ash and forced the
evacuation of Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, home to 15,000 Air Force
personnel and dependents.;    The Pentagon has ordered most of Clark's
military personnel out of the country, as well as all military dependents,
many of whom live at Subic Bay Naval Base 25 miles southwest of the volcano.; 
  U.S. officials in Cebu said nearly 2,000 Americans evacuated from Subic
aboard the aircraft carrier Midway left Cebu today on flights to Guam and the
United States.;    A few hundred Americans and Filipino wives remain in Cebu
but should be departing soon, officials said. Many of them were visiting
relatives in the countryside or were on leave when the evacuations began.;   
Today's eruptions spewed ash over the rich farmlands of Pampanga and Tarlac
provinces northeast of the 4,765-foot volcano.;    Officials warned today that
the tons of ash and debris on the slopes of Pinatubo pose a serious threat to
areas east of the mountain, including Clark and President Corazon Aquino's
sugar plantation in Tarlac.;    "It is only waiting for a strong, sustained
rainfall that can be delivered by the first typhoon that comes close to the
Pinatubo area," said Kelvin Rodolfo, a geology professor at the University of
Illinois-Chicago. "So if we have only a few typhoons, we will continue to
experience (mudflows) for many years.";    At least 296 people, including the
9-year-old daughter of a U.S. Air Force sergeant, have been killed since the
volcano exploded to life. Twenty people are listed as missing.  </TEXT>

be alert to the possibility of devastating avalanches from the tons of debris
on Mount Pinatubo's slopes.;    Institute officials said 168 separate quakes
were recorded near the volcano in the 24 hours ending early this morning.;   
More ominous, however, was the reappearance of low-frequency harmonic tremors,
which indicate magma is rising to the surface and pressure is building up
inside the volcano.;    Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said satellite
photographs showed a new lava dome forming in the crater, building up pressure
for a possible major eruption.;    Institute geologist Julio Sabit said such
low-frequency tremors preceded the June 14-15 eruptions, which dumped tons of
ash throughout central and southern Luzon and heavily damaged the U.S.-run
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     For the first time since the Japanese occupation in World War II, the
United States has no operational military airfields in the Philippines,
although Cubi Point is expected to be back in service later this month.;   
The U.S. military last week evacuated about 15,000 troops and their families
from Clark to Subic and later decided to send the spouses and children of
fliers home until the volcano quiets.;    But damage during Saturday's
eruption was so extensive at Subic, 25 miles from the volcano, that it was
decided to send home all 20,000 dependents, including Navy families.;    The
evacuation is expected to be complete by the end of the week, drawing down the
size of the U.S. military community from about 35,000 a week ago to about
15,000 uniformed personnel.;    Confusion surrounding the eruptions diverted
attention from deadlocked talks on the future of the bases.;    The lease
expires on Sept. 16, and the talks on an extension bogged down over
compensation and how long the Americans can stay.;    "I don't have a sense at
this point where the negotiations are going," said a U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. "I don't think anybody else does either.";    The
United States had agreed to return four small facilities to the Philippines
this year but proposed a 10- to 12-year extension on Clark and Subic in return
for $360 million a year in compensation.;    Manila demanded $825 million a
year, half in cash and the rest in trade concessions and debt relief, in
return for a seven-year extension.;    The Philippines appeared to be wavering
on the "non-cash component" and the two sides were only about $30 million
apart when the volcano began erupting June 9.;    Publicly, both sides
maintain that the eruptions will have no effect on the talks. Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus, the chief Philippine negotiator, said it is up to
Washington to decide whether it no longer wants use of Clark.;    In fact,
however, Mount Pinatubo has cast a shadow over the entire bases issue. The
volcano has been relatively quiet since Saturday, but Raymundo Punongbayan,
director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, says it
may remain active for several years.;    That raises questions not only about
the feasibility of the Americans remaining there but also whether the
Philippines can implement plans to transform Clark into an international
airport and commercial center if the U.S. troops leave.;    The Philippines
has traditionally used the bases as leverage for extracting more aid from the
United States.;    As long as Mount Pinatubo remains a threat, however, Manila
finds itself in the same position as someone trying to sell a house on Love
Canal.;    "If he (Manglapus) had closed the deal a month ago, the Americans
would have laid down a fat check," said one diplomat, who refused to be
identified by name or nationality. "Nobody wants to commit himself to a large
compensation when he's facing a major reconstruction bill.";    There has been
no estimate of overall damage to the bases, but the figure could easily run
into the millions. Clark is covered by 10 to 12 inches of ash, and numerous
buildings have been damaged.;    Roads at Clark are clogged with ash and mud.
Water and power have been disrupted and there has been some theft, although
the extent is unclear.;    At Subic, tons of ash cover roofs, roads and harbor
facilities, and water and power have been disrupted.;    About 166 buildings
are damaged, including George Dewey High School, where a 9-year-old Air Force
dependent was killed when a roof caved in late Saturday.;    Hot lines set;
The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps have established telephone hot lines for
information about U.S. armed services members their dependents in the
Philippines. Here are the toll-free telephone numbers:;    Air Force:
800-253-9276 (between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. PDT).;    Navy: 800-255-3808 (24

Pinatubo, and scientists said they expected a catastrophic blast from the
volcano.;    In an awesome display of nature's power, day turned into night by
midafternoon across central Luzon and as far south as Manila as a series of 11

ash pouring down. Thunderclaps and jagged streaks of lightning alternated with
brilliant orange flashes from the eruptions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The last 900 U.S. personnel were evacuated from Clark Air Base, deserting
one of America's oldest and largest overseas bases for the first time since
World War II. Philippine officials warned that looters would be shot.;   
About 15,000 evacuees from Clark have been taking shelter at Subic Bay Naval
Base, and the U.S. Embassy announced that 6,000 to 8,000 Air Force dependents
there would be evacuated to the United States on charter flights over the next
few weeks to relieve overcrowding. Ash in the atmosphere, however, has forced
Manila's airports to close.;    A Navy spokesman said there were no plans to
evacuate Subic. The base lies about 25 miles southwest of Pinatubo, but U.S.
officials say it is protected from volcanic flows by favorable terrain.;   
Still, base spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said the base had lost all
electricity and power, and a U.S. dependent and a Filipino were killed Sunday
when roofs collapsed under the weight of almost a foot of ash.;    Also
Sunday, six people died when a church collapsed in Dau, near Clark, and eight
people were killed when a hospital roof fell in Olongapo, near Subic,
officials and reports said.;    34 deaths so far;  These casualties raised to
34 the death toll from a week of volcanic eruptions, a typhoon and
earthquakes.;    Under orders from Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, the
government on Sunday extended the "danger zone" around the volcano from 18 to
25 miles and began evacuating three major cities, but washed-out bridges,
ash-clogged highways and a lack of transport slowed the effort.;    Officials
said they had only 250 buses and trucks to move the more than half million
people living in Angeles, Olongapo and San Fernando.;    But many residents,
either unaware of the evacuation or refusing to wait for help, on Saturday
started piling into cars, pedicabs, and trucks or trudged on foot through
knee-deep ash to escape the rumbling mountain.;    Experts fear total blowup; 
Scientists said a 1.8-mile-long fissure that has opened on Mount Pinatubo's
southern slopes raises the grim possibility that the 4,800-foot volcano may
blow itself apart, blasting deadly debris for miles and triggering massive
avalanches of super-hot gases and rocks far into the surrounding countryside.;
   "We are picturing a worst-case scenario," said Ronaldo Arboleda of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. "The situation is really
dangerous. . . . We are not gods, but, based on our studies, something not
good is about to happen.";    "It can go any time, any time now," agreed
Glenda Besana, another government geologist.;    The volcano, which was
dormant for 611 years, became active in April and began minor eruptions last
weekend. Major eruptions started Wednesday and have grown more violent each
day.;    At least 10 small, volcano-related earthquakes rocked the area
Saturday and were felt 60 miles south in Manila, where gray-white ash covered
the capital's streets, cars and rooftops like snow.;    Bizarre wind patterns
heightened the difficulties. Typhoon Yunya, which weakened to a tropical storm
as it swept north of the volcano Saturday, drew low-lying clouds of ash north
and east, while prevailing winds carried higher plumes south and west. The
effect was to dump a blanket of non-toxic silicate ash across most of central
Luzon.;    Half the buildings in the Philippines air force's Basa base
collapsed, officials reported. The ash has also caused incalculable damage to
crops and grazing lands.;    Combined with earthquakes of up to 4.4 on the
Richter scale, the torrents of rain, sand and lumps of pumice made life
miserable for more than 80,000 Filipinos already evacuated from areas near the
volcano and sowed panic in towns bordering the two huge U.S. military bases.
Residents used any means of transport they could find to try to escape the
volcano.;    Onslaught from the skies;  As mud and then a fierce hailstorm of
pumice reeking of sulfur began pelting down Saturday afternoon in Angeles,
tens of thousands of people frantically clambered aboard anything with wheels
and fled on ash-slicked roads in pitch-black darkness.;    Dump trucks and
flatbed trucks carried hundreds of bedraggled refugees, coated brown from the
mud and huddled miserably under tarps and umbrellas. Some hung on hoods and
trunks or clung desperately to the sides of vehicles.;    "We must run away,"
said Roger Pineda, whose wife, Rosario, fearfully clutched their 3-month-old
infant under a tarp as a rain of gravel clattered down. "The volcano is
coming.";    Others rode bicycles, motorcycles, buffalo carts and other
vehicles in what quickly became a nightmarish traffic jam on the two-lane
MacArthur Highway heading south. Trees cracked and fell on all sides from the
weight of the volcanic debris, halting bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours at a
time. The road repeatedly shook from earthquakes, and lightning and eruptions
eerily lit the sky in a hellish display.;    'Like the end of the world'; 
"It's like the end of the world," said Van Punzalan, a 34-year-old farmer who
drove his wife and two children on a tarp-covered motorcycle and sidecar.;   
Nearby, mud-covered and barefoot Arno Lusung, 21, drove his motorcycle behind
a truck carrying his wife and children.;    "I forgot my shoes," he said. "We
just ran."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo violently erupted today, spewing gray plumes of steam and ash
10 miles into the sky and sending a deadly mix of searing gas and molten rocks
down the volcano's slopes.;    Sirens sounded within minutes at Clark Air
Base, and 600 U.S. Air Force personnel who remained after an evacuation Monday
fled the base. About 900 others took shelter in a special command center but

<TEXT>     Roads nearby were clogged with cars, jeeps and buses as thousands of
terrified residents fled. Church bells pealed in the city of Angeles, adjacent
to the air base, warning the more than 300,000 residents to seek shelter.;   
Reporters at the scene said the blast created a greenish-gray mushroom cloud
"like an atomic bomb." They said they heard three blasts, and then a huge
gray-greenish cloud burst from the crater, blocking out the sun.;    There
were no immediate reports of injuries. Philippine officials had evacuated
about 19,000 villagers in recent days, but others stayed in scattered hamlets
to tend to their animals and farms.;    All telephone lines to Clark were
down, and Armed Forces Television was unable to broadcast after at least three
eruptions began at 8:51 a.m. (5:51 p.m. PDT), following two smaller emissions
before dawn. Another eruption occured shortly before noon.;    Scientists said
the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could
come later.;    "Most probably there will be more eruptions," said
seismologist Julio Sabit.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, said everyone within a 12-mile radius
should evacuate, or even within 18 miles, "to be safe.";    'Dark mushroom'; 
"The smoke is very thick, like a dark mushroom in the sky," Gus Abelgas, a
reporter for ABS-CBN television, said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the
volcano's western slopes. "It's just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    Other
reporters described panic as people scampered for safety with their belongings
and livestock.;    Most of the Americans stationed at Clark were transferred
to the Subic Bay Naval Base and were expected to remain there until the danger
from the volcano was past.;    In volcano's path;    Punongbayan said the site
where Clark is located was in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount
Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in the 14th century.;    Rollie
Rimando, another volcanologist, said a major eruption could hurl debris and
poisonous gases in a 12-mile radius, affecting both the base and parts of
Angeles.;    On Tuesday, a cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet
above the volcano but suddenly dissipated in the afternoon, only to revive
again 20 minutes later. The area on the western slope of the mountain was
covered in a thin layer of ash.;    Ash began falling Monday on villages west
of Angeles near the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, prompting authorities to close
roads there. But Angeles police said Tuesday that no one was evacuating the
area.;    Some refused to go;    A Philippine police major identified only as
Major Reyes said he visited a remote settlement near the volcano after the
blast and tried to talk a handful of residents into leaving. But they refused
to abandon their livestock and water buffaloes, known as carabaos.;    "If our
carabaos die, we'll die with them," the officer quoted them as saying.;   
Col. Jose Balajadia, chief of the Philippine military's Clark Air Base
Command, said Tuesday that troops remaining at the base had been issued gas
masks in case ash falls over the installation.;    At the Subic station,
newcomers from Clark tried to sort out their finances, adjust to cramped
living and otherwise cope with dislocation. Finance officers issued partial
pay to personnel who had to leave before having a chance to go to the bank.;  
 Smaller than anticipated;  The eruption appeared to be smaller than that
anticipated by Peter Lipman, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist in Menlo Park,
who on Monday had said an eruption as massive as that of Mount St. Helens
could occur any day.;    After the eruption, Lipman tried unsuccessfully to
telephone five USGS researchers monitoring the volcano from Clark Air Base.;  
 In a conversation with Lipman half an hour before the eruption, the
researchers said the volcano had had small eruptions earlier in the day. At
the time of the phone call, they were planning a helicopter ride above the
volcano to survey the size of the lava dome inside its crater.;    There are
about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major
eruption was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That
explosion killed about 200 people.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Filipino American
Chamber of Commerce of Santa Clara County is raising funds for evacuating
residents who live near the erupting volcano. Donations of any kind may be
sent to the Filipino American Chamber of Commerce, Santa Clara County, 72 N.

   CLARK AIR BASE, the Philippines -- Amando Ayson, a day
laborer at this U.S. military base, gapes at the damage
wrought by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and worries about
the future.
   Gritty, gray ash smothers the base's once-verdant grounds
under drifts as much as a meter deep. Collapsed warehouses
and abandoned homes appear ghostly through the swirling dust.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a canyon about 200 yards from the perimeter of the
base, a still-hot tongue of volcanic debris nearly half a
kilometer wide and four meters deep fills a channel where a
river once ran. On the horizon, a dark mushroom cloud blooms
over six miles into the sky, is swept away by the wind, and
is replaced with another.
   "A lot of people rely on Clark {for jobs} -- not only
people from here but from the {nearby} provinces," Mr. Ayson
says. "I don't think the base will close, but if it does, I
don't know what we will do."
   For Mr. Ayson and the tens of thousands of other Filipinos
who made their living directly or indirectly from the air
base, the impact of the volcanic eruptions that began early
last month could be dire. Once the largest U.S. air base
overseas, Clark has been transformed into a ghost town, its
two runways rendered useless by the highly corrosive ash and
the threat of continued eruptions.
   Sharp reductions in U.S. military personnel and dependents
at Clark and Subic Bay Naval Station, both within 25 miles of
the volcano's new crater, are expected to take a heavy toll
on central Luzon island. U.S. officials say the bases
previously pumped as much as $1 billion annually into the
Philippine economy.
   Experts are rushing to assess damage and future volcanic
threats to the bases before U.S. special negotiator Richard
Armitage arrives in Manila in mid-July to resume negotiations
on a new bases treaty. Costs include the repair of hundreds
of collapsed buildings, replacement of damaged equipment and
removal of millions of tons of sandy ash.
   Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus has said he is
confident the U.S. will want to retain both bases. "I visited
Clark," he said last week. "It will need a lot of scraping. A
lot of roofs will need to be mended. I do not see that it has
been rendered totally useless."
   U.S. officials in the Philippines have also asserted that
they remain interested in reaching an agreement on both
bases. Rear Adm. Thomas Mercer, commander of U.S. forces in
the Philippines, said recently that his mission was to put
Clark and Subic back "exactly as" they were.
   In Washington, however, at least some officials apparently
believe the U.S. assurances emanating from Manila have gone
too far. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said, in
response to reports from the Philippines, that "Adm. Mercer's
statement notwithstanding, we have not made any decision on
whether to keep Clark and Subic going at their pre-volcano
levels."
   Privately, some U.S. officials say that Washington merely
seeks to keep its options open until damage from the volcano
can be assessed. Assurances of U.S. interest are necessary,
they say, to prevent an anti-bases faction in the Philippine
government from using the eruption to push for a U.S.
pullout.
   While assessments of current damage continue, the more
difficult calculation is the threat of future eruptions.
Subic received heavier ash falls and sustained more serious
damage, but only Clark is threatened by pyroclastic flows,
deadly avalanches of superheated gas, sand and rocks that
hurl down the slopes at speeds of as much as 100 miles an
hour.
   "We can't be assured that there won't be more major
eruptive activity," says Ed Wolfe, chief scientist at the
Cascades Volcano Observatory, established in Vancouver,
Wash., after the 1980 explosion of Mount St. Helens. "If
there is, Clark will be subject to the same sorts of threats
that it was in June."
   One of about a dozen U.S. scientists who helped the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology predict
the June eruption that forced the temporary evacuation of
Clark, Mr. Wolfe said that even if the volcano doesn't blow
again, it will continue spewing hot ash for several months,
and possibly for years.
   Ash emissions are a serious hazard to aircraft in flight,
particularly jets. On the ground, the powdery sand is a
maintenance nightmare that shorts electrical lines, jams
generators and corrodes machinery.
   During the June to October monsoon, Clark is downwind from
the ash emissions. Subic, on the other hand, is separated
from the volcano by a low mountain range and was only heavily
coated with ash because the main eruption coincided with a
typhoon that altered the prevailing winds.
   Both bases, and their adjoining cities, face serious flood
risks because streams and drains have been clogged with
volcanic sand. However, the danger is greater in Angeles
City, adjacent to Clark, where fast-moving slushes of water
and volcanic debris known as lahars are expected with the
first heavy rains.
   "All the solid material is up there in great abundance;
all we need is the triggering action," says Kelvin Rodolfo, a
Philippine-born U.S. geologist who heads the Pinatubo Lahar
Hazard Task Force.
   Massive lahars also are anticipated in a string of towns
along narrow river valleys north of Subic, but the navy base
and the adjacent city of Olongapo don't face a serious lahar
threat, Mr. Rodolfo says.
   Damage from ash fall and earthquakes at Subic and Olongapo
has nonetheless been severe. Fifty-five people were killed by
eruption fallout in Olongapo, including several who died when
the 200-bed city hospital collapsed beneath ash.
   On the naval base itself, a hail of sand smashed more than
200 structures, including dozens of warehouses and workshops
vital to the base's primary mission of repairing and
resupplying U.S. Navy vessels. The volcanic fallout also
shredded 37,000 acres of triple-canopy jungle, the last large
stand of virgin forest in Luzon.
   Protected from the illegal logging that has deforested
most of the rest of the island, the Subic jungle provided the
base with a vital watershed and a unique venue for
jungle-survival courses taught by aboriginal Aetas, a Negrito
people descended from some of the earliest inhabitants of the
Philippine archipelago.
   The jungle is now a wasteland of smashed trees and broken
ash-coated limbs, its once-teeming wildlife population either
scattered or destroyed. Monkeys that survived the eruption
have left the jungle to scavenge for garbage in other parts
of the base.

<TEXT>     In Japan, heavy rain sent tons of mud and volcanic debris cascading down
Mount Unzen, washing away or damaging at least 70 empty houses and slightly
injuring one fleeing resident, officials said today.;    Weather forecasters
predicted continuing rain in the area.;    In the Philippines, 4,795-foot
Mount Pinatubo is in its fourth week of eruptions after being dormant 600
years. Officials say 338 people have been killed during the eruptions.;   
Volcanologist Julio Sabit said low-frequency tremors, similar to those
observed prior to major eruptions three weeks ago, preceded the ash ejection
this morning.;    Authorities warned residents to be alert for high walls of
flowing volcanic ash, boulders and debris that move rapidly downstream and can
bury whole towns in their path.;    Mudflows hit settlements near the towns of
Porac and Florida Blanca, about 40 miles northwest of Manila.;    Witnesses
said houses were buried up to their rooftops and an undetermined number of
cattle were killed.;    There were sketchy reports today of similar mudflows
in the Balintawak River northwest of the volcano but poor communications made
it impossible to verify the reports.;    Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos,
chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council, said crews were
deepening river channels near the volcano in hopes of preventing spillovers.; 
  The eruptions severely damaged the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and Subic Bay
Naval Base, raising doubts over their future. The lease on the bases expires
Sept. 16, and talks resume here this month in an effort to reach an agreement
on a possible extension.;    U.S. officials said today they expect to complete
a damage assessment of the bases by July 9.;    The Philippine government has
also not completed its assessment of overall damage, which was extensive.
Agriculture Secretary Senen Bacani said today that damage to crops alone was
$15 million.;    Near Mount Unzen in Japan, the flow of mud, almost 450 feet
wide, started Sunday and was knee-deep today in an abandoned residential area
along the Mizunashi River.;    Many residents along the river left their homes
after Mount Unzen erupted in early June, killing 41 people. About 1,200 people
were evacuated from the area Sunday as rain swept ash and basketball-size
rocks down three rivers.;    By this afternoon, the mudflow had reached
Shimabara port, five miles east of the 4,485-foot volcano, police said. It
wrecked a bridge and partially blocked a road and a railway as it swept
through Shimabara, a city of 45,000 residents, said a Nagasaki police
officer.;    The observatory monitoring Mount Unzen said volcanic debris still
covering the east side of the mountain lends itself to landslides. It said the
volcano is still spewing out gas, rocks and ash.;    About 9,000 people have
been evacuated from the foot of Mount Unzen.;    Mount Unzen, 610 miles
southwest of Tokyo, erupted Nov. 17 for the first time in 198 years.;    Unzen
was the site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster, which killed about 15,000
people in 1792.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IN A THOUGHTFUL speech to a California audience in 1984, Jon Tinker of the
environmental group Earthscan reflected on the different ways in which rich
and poor countries are equipped to deal with disasters. Recalling the westward
flight from the dust bowl in "The Grapes of Wrath," he commented: "Steinbeck's
Okies did not always like what they found there, but there was at least
somewhere else to go. . . . There are no Californias in the Third World.";   
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines brings the remark to mind
with special force. Nature -- or an act of God, if you will -- can sometimes
expose the realities of rich and poor, of power and impotence, in the manner
of a parable.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The mountain began to blow its top on June 12, Philippine Independence Day.
The timing was ironic, since the story that played so dramatically on the
evening news in the United States was the battle to save Clark Air Force Base
and Subic Bay Naval Base, two huge military installations that are a bitter
irritant to Philippine nationalists.;    Fourteen thousand people from Clark
were moved with prompt efficiency to Subic Bay. As it became clear that the
threat from the volcano was not over, more than 20,000 dependents from both
bases were being evacuated. A Navy battle group was diverted from Okinawa to
spearhead the operation, led by the most modern nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier in the fleet, the Abraham Lincoln. Evacuees were shuttled out on Air
Force C-141 transports backed up by chartered civilian aircraft. There was one
American fatality.;    More than 260 Filipinos have died, suffocated by sulfur
fumes, crushed in collapsing buildings, drowned in swollen rivers and
mudslides. Others fled in trucks, on bicycles or simply on foot, clutching
children and domestic animals. Thousands took refuge in the bleachers of a
Manila sports stadium, exposed to the elements.;    The U.S. military was not
altogether unmindful of the refugees' plight. One million Meals Ready to Eat,
or MREs, happily surplus because of the speedy conclusion of the Persian Gulf
war, were distributed to the survivors. And U.S. troops found reasons to be
cheerful at a time of crisis. One young sergeant at Clark said he thought the
volcanic eruption "was kind of neat. It looked like one of the nuclear tests
at Bikini Island." His superior officers also found a silver lining in the
mushroom cloud, concluding that the disaster would lower the market value of
the bases and so strengthen America's hand in negotiations over their future
"rent" when the current lease expires Sept. 16.;    Clark and Subic date back
to the turn of the century, when President McKinley decided that it was
America's mission to "uplift and Christianize" the Philippines. In the Cold
War years, the bases were crucial to the containment of Soviet power in the
Pacific. The Pentagon insists it still finds them necessary, even after last
year's Soviet pullout from Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay, the only Soviet base on
foreign soil.;    The Pentagon also likes to argue that the bases benefit the
Philippine economy, although there is no reason to suppose that closing them
would do any great harm. Civilian reconversion posed no special difficulties
for Thailand when U.S. troops and bases were pulled out in 1976, after the
defeat in Vietnam. The British shut down their naval base in Singapore in
1971, and it soon became one of the most successful shipyards in Asia.
Manila's Economic Development Foundation has estimated that the country could
earn $300 million a year just by tilling the 100,000 acres of unused farmland
inside the bases' perimeters.;    The Philippine government has proposed $825
million as a fair annual rent for the bases over the next seven years; the
U.S. counteroffer is $360 million per year for 10 years. Of course, this is
not the bases' only relationship to the local economy. Tens of thousands of
Filipinos work at Clark and Subic and 20,000 women and children in the
honky-tonk town of Olongapo have found employment of a sort servicing the
sexual demands of U.S. sailors and airmen.;    Wearied by yet another scene of
mass calamity, Americans have begun to experience what the disaster-relief
agencies call compassion fatigue. Watching the ash rain down from Mount
Pinatubo, the reflex is to flip the channel and hide behind the old cliche
that life in the Third World is cheap. But a darker question remains: In those
parts of the Third World where the United States has planted itself, are some
lives not cheaper than others?  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The United States on Monday indicated that it is ready to give up Clark Air
Base, which was devastated by the Philippines' Mount Pinatubo volcano eruption
last month.;    U.S. special negotiator Richard Armitage, arriving for the
latest round of talks on the future of two major U.S. military bases, issued a
statement aimed at preparing Philippine authorities for an American withdrawal
from Clark. The site has been occupied by the U.S. military for most of this
century.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  U.S. HINTS AT LEAVING AIR BASE
VOLCANO DAMAGE PUTS FUTURE OF CLARK IN DOUBT,
OFFICIAL SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Mount Pinatubo, which continues to spurt huge plumes of volcanic ash, lies
10 miles west of Clark and less than 25 miles northeast of Subic Bay Naval
Base, a major resupply and ship repair facility. The United States is
interested in holding on to Subic, which also was damaged badly by fallen ash
but continues to function as a naval base.;    Citing "substantial damage"
from fallen volcanic ash, aviation hazards from continuing ash emissions and
the threat of further damage from mudflows and floods, Armitage said he had
told Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus that "the future of Clark is
questionable.";    Other sources close to the talks said Armitage was putting
it mildly. Adm. Charles Larson, the visiting commander of the U.S. Pacific
Command, told President Corazon Aquino on Monday that he was "very
pessimistic" about the utility of Clark and the adjacent Crow Valley aerial
training range, a presidential spokesman said.;    A U.S. negotiator said that
although a final decision is pending, the U.S. Air Force is virtually certain
to give up its huge base 50 miles north of Manila. Even if the Philippines
drops its insistence on limiting a new bases agreement to seven years and
accedes to a U.S. demand for at least 10 years, the official said, the longer
time frame still would be too short to justify the hundreds of millions of
dollars required to rehabilitate Clark, especially given the uncertainty of
the volcano's behavior for years to come.;    "There is no prospect that
significant sums of money will be spent to clean (Clark) up and reconstruct
it," the official said.;    Most of Clark's 16,000 Americans -- including
aviators, civilian employees and dependents -- were evacuated in June, leaving
about 2,200 Air Force personnel to guard the base. All serviceable aircraft
also were removed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  An erupting volcano in the Philippines has turned the two largest U.S.
military bases in Asia into "a wasteland," U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said
Tuesday.;    Platt, who has toured Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base
since the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, said in a U.S. television interview
that it would be "a long time" before the full extent of the damage to the
bases was determined.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HEAVY VOLCANIC DAMAGE AT BASES
CLARK, SUBIC SEEN AS 'A WASTELAND'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     U.S. officials painted a depressing picture of conditions and damage at
Clark and Subic.;    At Subic, power and water have been virtually knocked out
by heavy ash falls, and at Clark the damage to buildings was more extensive
than initially thought, officials said. They said Clark's commissary and all
its warehouses collapsed under the weight of ash soaked by torrential rains,
and that many warehouses in the base's supply area also caved in.;    While
both bases have six to 12 inches of ash on the ground, Clark is in relatively
worse shape because it needs clean air to function as an air base, and the ash
fall has "rendered it inoperable," a U.S. diplomat said.;    Officials at
Subic Bay said it could be two months or more before full electricity and
water services were restored to the sprawling naval base.;    "From all the
ash, it looks like a moonscape up here," said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, a
spokesman at Subic Bay.;    Scientists said the volcano was steadily calming
Tuesday, and they reduced the danger zone around Pinatubo from 18 miles to 12
miles. At least three small earth tremors were recorded at the volcano, and
one small explosion covered nearby Clark with fresh ash.;    Eight more U.S.
warships steamed toward Subic Bay to help speed an exodus of American military
dependents from Clark and the Subic naval base. Military officials hoped to
remove all 20,000 dependents by the end of the week.;    Since Sunday, 10
warships have carried more than 7,000 spouses and children from Subic.;    The
Red Cross said 146 people had died since June 9, when the 4,795-foot volcano
began spewing ash, steam and superheated rocks for the first time in 600
years. About 200,000 Filipinos were forced to flee their homes.;    Damage to
the two military sites has complicated already sensitive negotiations to renew
the base leases.;    "Everything's on hold right now," Pentagon spokesman Bob
Hall said after receiving damage reports on the two bases.;    "It's fair to
say that nobody right now is planning to start up negotiations on this issue
until both sides assess where they stand," Hall said.;     IF YOU'RE

<LEADPARA>  The Air Force announced Thursday that it would evacuate more than half of its
uniformed personnel in the Philippines because of an erupting volcano that has
coated Clark Air Base in ash, making it unusable.;    The pullout of 4,500 of
the 7,000 active-duty workers assigned to Clark would be the first major
withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from the Philippines since Mount
Pinatubo unleashed a series of deadly eruptions last week. The evacuation of
their families was begun last week and is almost complete. Clark is 10 miles

<TEXT>     The evacuation announced Thursday "was based on the conditions at Clark and
the inability of Clark to sustain a large population over the short term,"
said Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Manila. "It's a real
mess up there.";    U.S. officials in Washington and Manila have suggested
that Clark may be abandoned because of unacceptably high reconstruction costs.
Clark is buried under volcanic ash that varies from six inches to a foot
deep.;    Officials say the Subic Bay Naval Station is by far the more
valuable of the U.S. bases in the Philippines. It is a principal maintenance,
supply and storage base for the 180 ships of the Pacific Fleet, and is the
most convenient full-service port for Navy vessels in most areas of the Indian
Ocean.;    "Subic is a nearly perfect, well-protected deep-water harbor that
would be impossible for the Navy to re-create," said an administration
official in Washington. "Clark is not irreplaceable, especially if it's
covered with volcanic sludge.";    New eruptions Thursday released a cloud of
swirling gray ash nearly three miles high, dumping a new layer of ash on the
base and creating fresh misery for hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who have
struggled to dig out from beneath the ash and rock that rained down on their
homes last weekend.;    The death toll from last weekend's eruption rose to
268, Philippine officials said, and damage reports continue to grow. About
250,000 people were made homeless, and thousands of homes and buildings were
destroyed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
any time," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HUGE ERUPTION LIKELY IN PHILIPPINES 'ANY
TIME'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano
today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology said.;    If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash
produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of Angeles City, where the air base is
located, about 50 miles north of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not
erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at
least, Lipman said.;    Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the
eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he
said.;    The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark
Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near
the volcano.;    The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their
equipment, today  moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles
from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    Mount
Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire"
on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas. (These volcanoes -- including
Mount Lassen in Shasta County, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in
Washington, all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense
crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.);    Pinatubo's last eruption,
600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half
a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Until
volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath
the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.;    Other recent
volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and
Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.;    If it does have a massive eruption,
Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish
avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to
100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a
really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with
glowing ash, Lipman said.;    Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off
the avalanche is fatal. That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;   
Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base,
Lipman said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash --
indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their
engines stalled by the grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from
the base. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin
any day, would send ash directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity
-- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock
plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is
imminent, Lipman said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on
the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days
they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    Their predictions
might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already. But it
would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before
scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the
base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be
linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.;    "No reputable
scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between the two, Lipman said.;   
More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted. "Two out of
500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     They are among 20,000 U.S. military personnel and dependents evacuated from
Clark and from Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines after Mount Pinatubo
began a series of eruptions June 9 that have killed 169 people.;    Some of
the early arrivals told harrowing stories of seeing collapsed buildings and a
countryside covered in white volcanic ash. Some said they had to flee with no
more than the clothes on their backs.;    "I've never been in an earthquake, a
volcano and a typhoon at the same time before," said Air Force Capt. Cliff
Breier, who managed to get his Doberman dog on the evacuation plane.;    "You
could see the hills in the distance. It looked like the Alps. Everything was
ash gray or white," said Air Force Capt. Scott Weyant.;    Air Force Master
Sgt. Benjamin Reese said he and his family were moved twice at Subic because
the weight of the ash was too much for base buildings.;    "The fire station I
know was totally collapsed on its trucks," he said.;    Air Force security
policeman Joseph Callahan said he and his colleagues worked 14-hour shifts to
keep looters away from Clark.;    As many as 5,000 of the soldiers and their
relatives are expected to arrive at McChord in the next few days, said Sgt.
Jim Davis, base spokesman.;    The first arrivals were offered medical care,
travel expenses and money for clothing and other needs. Dozens of phones were
provided so they could call home.;    "Some people got out with literally no
shoes, nothing, because buildings were collapsing on them," said Holly
Erickson, wife of an Air Force captain.;    Air Force Capt. John Litten said
people had to flee with only the few possessions they could carry aboard the
plane. That included a dozen cats and dogs.;    "Whatever they left behind,
they can expect never to see again," he said.;    Their 2 1/2-day journey
began aboard Navy ships that left Subic Bay for the Philippine island of Cebu.
From there, they flew to Guam and then on to Hawaii before the final flight to
McChord, said Navy Lt. Ron Barkdull.;    One of the evacuees, Debbie Parker,
of Roanoke, Va., said by phone from Guam earlier Tuesday that she and her
three children were waiting to hear when her husband, Maj. Greg Parker, would
be joining them.;    "I've heard that my husband has evacuated and I don't
know where he is," she said. "I would love to know because that is the only
thing that is bothering me right now besides wanting everyone out.";    Litten
said some of the evacuees who arrived at McChord would begin leaving for
hometowns across the country as early as today.;    About 60 people in
military and civilian clothes were on hand to greet the first arrivals.;    In
Manila, meanwhile, foreign flights out of the capital's crippled airport
resumed today as Mount Pinatubo's daily eruptions entered their second week.
At least three more earth tremors were recorded and an explosion blanketed
Clark Air Base with more ash.;    Still, scientists said Pinatubo was steadily
calming and they reduced the danger zone from a radius of 18 to 12 miles. That
still encompasses Clark, which is 10 miles east of the volcano.;    Food and
clean drinking water were running low in central and southwestern portions of
Luzon island, which includes the volcano and Manila. Thousands of homes were
buried in ash and hundreds of thousands of people are homeless.;    Manila's
Ninoy Aquino International Airport remained officially closed today, but
planes from Quantas, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific and Singapore airlines left "at
their own risk" with passengers aboard.;    They had been stranded by
Saturday's huge eruption.;    Airport officials said planes from other
airlines were still stranded.;    No new ash has fallen since Saturday on
Manila, 60 miles south of the volcano, but the city's air remained clogged
with fine, sand-like debris.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Donations can be mailed to

<TEXT>     An eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it "sent
seismograph needles off the chart," and registered 60 miles south in Manila,
said Jessie Daligdig, a government geologist.;    Villagers tied wet kerchiefs
on their faces and used rakes, shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket
of snow-like ash from roads. At times, winds whipped the grit into the air,
forcing cars to use windshield wipers and headlights in blizzard-like
conditions through the afternoon.;    Two people have been reported killed so
far, a Filipino serving in the U.S. Navy who died in a traffic accident on an
ash-slick road and a Filipino boy reported to have died after inhaling
sulfuric fumes that began to seep from the volcano last weekend.;    The
initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 8:51 a.m. Wednesday sent a
10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies
over Clark Air Base, forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American
volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive
communications equipment.;    Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work
at Clark were evacuated Monday, when scientists said it was clear that the
volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life.;    U.S.
officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Clark, but
they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on
the base were hit by molten rock.;    Many of the villages in the vicinity
were holding Independence Day celebrations when heavy gray clouds first began
raining ash Wednesday morning. The mayor in San Marcelino, 17 miles southwest
of the volcano, was giving a speech to several thousand people when dark
clouds suddenly blotted the sun and turned day to night.;    Calixto Macalma
Jr., a police intelligence officer, said people panicked as it began "raining
sand." Church bells pealed in alarm, sirens wailed and many ran for shelter.; 
  Philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated 19,369
people from villages within a 12-mile radius of the volcano by late Wednesday.
Along the roads, some people wore cardboard boxes on their heads for
protection; some rode their water buffaloes to safety.;    At least 330
villagers, who had ignored earlier warnings to flee Aglao hamlet, finally
abandoned their homes Wednesday afternoon.;    "There were big stones, like
this," said one woman who escaped, holding out her fists. "We are very
scared.";    Thousands of residents of Angeles City, east of the volcano,
initially fled in panic from the booming morning blasts and greenish-gray
mushroom cloud that towered over the area. Passenger jeeps sped through the
streets, refusing to stop for riders as the drivers drove for cover. Most
residents later returned to the sprawling city.;    But officials issued no
general evacuation order for Angeles, even though the city is next to Clark
Air Base. U.S. geologists advising the Philippine government said most of
Angeles was not at risk, apparently basing their assessment on earth samples
indicating that earlier eruptions had reached the area on which Clark now
stands but had spared what is now Angeles.;    President Corazon Aquino
helicoptered to refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to
Manila for an Independence Day rally and parade at Luneta Park. She authorized
the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts.;    Raymundo Punongbayan,
director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said
scientists could not estimate how much magma was still pent up inside Mount
Pinatubo, but said more eruptions at least as violent are expected within the
next three days.;    "All we can do is wait," he said. "The crisis is not
over."  </TEXT>

   U.S. Is Seeking
   `Flexible' Pact
   On Clark Base

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is seeking a new agreement with the
Philippines that will give it some "flexibility" to use all
or part of Clark Air Base or abandon the heavily
volcano-damaged base entirely, Pentagon spokesman Pete
William said.
   Speaking shortly before the resumption of negotiations in
Manila over the future of U.S. bases in the Philippines, Mr.
Williams said the U.S. definitely wants to keep the Subic Bay
naval base, though. The negotiations were to resume yesterday
for the first time since the eruption of Mount Pinatubo cast
a further cloud on the future of the bases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There have been suspicions that the U.S. might abandon the
bases in the wake of the volcano's eruption, especially given
the Pentagon's budget strains and the diminished Soviet
military threat.
   Richard Armitage, the U.S. special negotiator, was
expected to get a damage assessment from Adm. Charles Larsen,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, before
sitting down with his Philippine counterparts. Before the
talks were suspended, the U.S. had offered the Philippines
$360 million in annual compensation for 10 years. Manila was
holding out for $825 million a year for seven years, but it
was willing to accept a portion of that sum in the form of
trade preferences and other non-budgetary benefits.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. has to deal with an upheaval of a
political kind. Oscar Orbos, a well-regarded administrator
who helped get the bases talks moving earlier this year, is
out of his job as President Corazon Aquino's executive
secretary. His abrupt departure last week was linked to
internal politics rather than to his role in the bases
negotiations, but it creates yet another uncertainty about
the talks.
   Opponents of the bases are criticizing the U.S. for not
doing enough to ease the plight of 250,000 evacuees who lost
their livelihoods when Mount Pinatubo covered their farms and
towns with a thick shroud of ash. The State Department said
the U.S. so far has spent $1.6 million in disaster relief for
the affected provinces.
   In a news briefing, Mr. Williams said the Subic naval base
is in "relatively good shape" and isn't likely to be
threatened by mudslides or flooding. However, he said the
outlook for further U.S. use of Clark Air Base is "very
uncertain" because of the potentially large reconstruction
costs and the hazards that the still-active Pinatubo
continues to pose for aviation.
   Although the U.S. wants to keep Subic, it may decide to
retain just one part of Clark, its Crow Valley aerial gunnery
range, and give up the rest of the air base, the Pentagon
spokesman said. He declined to say how such a decision would
affect the U.S. offer.
   Both governments are trying to conclude a new bases accord
by Sept. 16, a deadline set by a provision of the Philippine
Constitution.

expect an eruption on the scale of the one on June 14-15, which sent ash
drifting as far as Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore.;    Meanwhile, the
Philippine foreign secretary said today that if Washington decides to keep
volcano-damaged Subic Bay naval base and Clark Air Base it may have to pay
even more for them because "we suffered more than the Americans did.";    The

   As Philippine Volcano Becomes Quiet,
   Concern Turns to Future of U.S. Bases

   Economists and businessmen say damage to the Philippine
economy from the spectacular eruption of Mt. Pinatubo has
been relatively minimal so far. But they are less certain of
the volcano's effect on the two U.S. military bases that
sprawl in its shadow.
   The Pentagon said the possibility of future eruptions and
the cost of repairs to Clark Air Base and Subic Bay naval
base may force the U.S. to re-evaluate its presence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The question of whether we will remain in the Philippines
is something we have to look at in light of this disaster,"
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.
   Mass evacuations from the slopes of Mount Pinatubo and
nearby cities and towns and the closure of Clark have created
a sense that the Philippines faces a disaster similar in
severity to the July 1990 earthquake that killed more than
2,000 people and damaged roads, bridges and buildings
throughout the main island of Luzon. But estimates by
Philippine officials, foreign economists and
international-aid experts suggest that the eruption, which
has killed about 170 people, will have little impact on the
country's economy.
   Vulcanologists say the worst of the eruptions are probably
past, and concern in Manila is turning to the future of the
ash-coated U.S. bases. The bases have been the subject of
protracted and acrimonious talks that appeared to be moving
toward agreement when Mt. Pinatubo stirred last week after a
600-year sleep.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said the U.S. is
assessing damage at Clark and Subic Bay, and "until we have
that assessment, it's too early to speculate on the future of
the bases or the future of the negotiations." He added that
"no formal policy review" is under way, and that "the talks
have not been suspended or put on hold in that sense."
   Officials in the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs,
which has overseen the base negotiations, expressed concern
that the U.S. would use the reduced utility of the bases as a
bargaining chip to press for a cut in compensation payments
to Manila or to obtain an extended lease. The U.S. Embassy
said the U.S. would not exploit the situation.
   The lease on both bases expires Sept. 16, and Washington
has offered to pay $360 million a year in bases-linked
compensation, mostly military aid, for an extension of 10 to
12 years. Manila has been demanding $825 million a year in
exchange for a seven-year extension.
   The 4,500 U.S. Air Force personnel and 23,000 dependents
and civilians who are being withdrawn from the two bases
would hurt the local economy nearby. But economists believe
the eruption won't further cloud the country's already grim
overall economic prospects, though tourism is likely to
suffer. A World Bank economist said its projections for
growth in gross national product of 1.5% to 2% this year and
3.5% in 1992 would remain unchanged.
   While some observers express concern that the eruption
could deter foreign investors, businessmen in Manila are
generally unfazed. "The Philippines has come through far
worse than Mount Pinatubo," said Thomas J. Leber, president
of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines.

<LEADPARA>  Hard-pressed Philippine officials stepped up rescue and relief efforts
Wednesday amid growing fears of disastrous mudslides from millions of tons of
rocks and ash that rained down during last weekend's devastating eruption of
Mount Pinatubo.;    Scientists estimate that the massive eruption dropped
volcanic debris more than 1,000 feet thick on parts of the volcano's steep
slopes. Heavy rains drenched the area Wednesday in the beginning of the annual
monsoon season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Mixed with rain, mixed with water, it becomes a liquid concrete river,"
said a Western diplomat who is monitoring the crisis. "That's our chief
concern right now.";    Aerial surveys indicated that the eruption "completely
obliterated" an area up to 7.4 miles from the volcano, with considerable
damage within a 12-mile radius, he said.;    Most of the debris came from a
huge dome of magma that built up on the mountain's summit after it burst into
life June 9 after lying dormant more than 600 years. The dome is now a deep
crater more than a mile wide.;    While still active, the volcano has calmed
steadily since Sunday, and thousands of people have returned to the area.;   
The magnitude of the Mount Pinatubo disaster grew Wednesday as the death toll
rose to 169, with an estimated quarter-million people made homeless.;    The
heavy ash crushed thousands of homes and buildings, collapsed bridges and
roads and buried vast sugar cane and rice fields. Economic losses are believed
to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Airman 1st Class Sean Taylor stepped off a C-141 jet transport at Travis Air
Force Base Friday afternoon with all of his earthly belongings: two pairs of
Levis and four shirts stuffed into a black plastic bag.;    About three weeks
ago, after signs that the Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines might
erupt, Taylor was sent from Clark Air Base to Subic Bay Naval Base to help set
up evacuation operations "just in case" Pinatubo blew.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They told me to pack for three days, and that's what I did," said Taylor,
23. "Just 36 hours later, the volcano exploded and spewed ash everywhere. Next
thing you know, nobody's allowed to go back.";    He lost everything,
including his seven-foot pet python.;    For thousands of military personnel
like Taylor and their families, the journey home began June 10, when Mount
Pinatubo erupted for the first time, showering their homes at Clark Air Base
with ash.;    They left the base with nothing more than they could carry and
headed for Subic Bay, 23 miles south.;    After a second eruption five days
later, they were packed aboard U.S. Navy ships for a choppy 350-mile trip to
the island of Cebu, where Air Force and civilian aircraft flew them to Guam,
then to Hawaii, then to Travis.;    Four flights came in Thursday, another
four Friday, and up to 3,000 people were expected to pass through Travis by
Monday, said base spokesman Lt. Col. Jim Dilda.;    Other evacuees are being
flown to McChord Air Force Base in Washington. U.S. Embassy officials have
said between 6,000 to 8,000 family members will be flown to the United States
on chartered flights during the next few weeks.;    Looking exhausted and
anxious, more than 120 American service personnel and their spouses, children
and dogs and cats stumbled off the jet at 1:20 p.m. Friday at Travis.;    On
the runway, they were met by a Travis volunteer who acted as a "sponsor." Each
sponsor located a family and led them into the airport to be fed -- and in
some cases -- clothed. The volunteers played with children, walked dogs, and
set up travel arrangements for the displaced families with no money.;   
Eleven-year-old Jennifer Jettner sat with her sisters, Michelle, 18, and
Rizza, 17, while her mother waited in line for money -- they were able to get
as much as three months advance pay -- and plane tickets, so she and her
children could fly to Florida to stay with the girls' grandparents.;    The
girls talked of the terror of the volcano, saying the ash and smoke were so
thick at times it was impossible to see anything.;    "It was raining and
ashy, and it was pitch black," Jennifer said. "We had the ash falling,
tremors, and a typhoon all in one day.;    "One guy that was staying next door
to us did nothing but scream or sing really loud all day long," she said.
"Every time there was a tremor, he'd sing. I think he was praying or
something.";    He wasn't the only one.;    Taylor said he should have known
Pinatubo would blow in April when the enormous mountain began letting out
steam, a little at a time.;    But it wasn't until last week when that pitch
blackness hovered over Subic Bay for more than 27 hours that he thought,
"there's no way we can all get out of this alive.";    "The first time it
(erupted), it was beautiful," Taylor said. "It looked like a huge gray
mushroom cloud. Then the ash started falling.;    "Then it rained. And the ash
turned to cement," he said. "We were outside in the rain, on the tops of the
buildings, shoveling the ash off, hoping they wouldn't collapse beneath our
feet.;    "But all that's over now. And I'm on my way to Kansas City," he
said. "For some R and R."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The private television station GMA said mud flows had occurred near the
towns of Porac and Florida Blanca, about 40 miles northwest of Manila and near
the volcano.;    The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said
the incidents were not volcanic mud flows, but flooding and landslides caused
by heavy rains and accumulations of mud and volcanic debris from recent
eruptions.;    The institute said the Porac River in Pampanga had risen three
feet because of rain and ash accumulations since Mount Pinatubo began erupting
June 9.;    In the village of Pio, on the Porac River, residents fled their
homes near the riverbanks when they heard the rumbling sound.;    Soldiers
fired their weapons in the air to warn residents. Reporters said a huge mound
of steaming earth and boulders as large as refrigerators suddenly rolled down
the banks of the river, burying houses up to their roofs.;    There were no
reports of fatalities since everyone in the village had moved to higher
ground, the reporters said. Officials warned of possible flooding along four
other rivers in Pampanga, Tarlac and Zambales provinces, which border the
volcano.;    In Japan, at least 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes
Sunday as torrential rains swept down debris from Mount Unzen's previous
eruptions.;    Volcanic ash and basketball-size rocks washed down three rivers
from the 4,485-foot volcano, but no casualties were reported, said Ichiro Otsu
of the fire department in Shimabara, at the base of the volcano.;    More than
9,000 residents have been evacuated from outlying parts of Shimabara, a city
of 45,000, since avalanches of ash and superheated rocks spewing from the
volcano killed 41 people and injured 10 others June 4.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     "We're gonna end up like refugees," fumed Air Force Staff Sgt. Lenny
Mastri, as he sat in a mileslong traffic jam with his wife and three children.
"I'd rather be back home. I'm not worried about the volcano.";    "When the
Air Force says move, we move," said Devata Rivard, whose husband was one of
1,500 U.S. troops left behind to guard America's oldest overseas base. "But I
believe the Lord will take care of us.";    U.S. Navy officials at Subic Bay
will need all the help they can get. The sudden evacuation from a feared
eruption of Mount Pinatubo has doubled Subic's resident population, a base
where housing already is in short supply.;    "We've asked all families to
double up," said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, a Subic spokesman. "We're stuffing
people anywhere we can. . . . Basically, anywhere we can put a cot, we are."; 
  Some of the departing Clark personnel feared that "economic intruders,"
official Air Force jargon for local thieves, will take advantage of the
Americans' absence.;    "We took everything we wanted to see again," said a
burly Air Force sergeant whose red pickup truck was heavily loaded with bags
and boxes. "We live off-base. We think when we get back, everything will be
ripped off.";    A hand-lettered sign for Filipino workers, saying "No Work
Today," was tacked to the front gate at Clark after the last convoy of cars
left. Armed military police sped about inside in jeeps, but the sprawling base
otherwise appeared deserted.;    Not so outside, where some 350,000 residents
of Angeles City went about their lives.;    Philippine officials ordered more
than 12,000 Filipinos living near the volcano to leave the mountain, but they
did not evacuate Angeles City.;    City police Sgt. Rodolfo Talledo said most
residents were concerned about the volcano but there was no panic.;    "No one
seems to be afraid and nobody is evacuating because they don't think they are
in any immediate danger," he said. "Only the people from Clark left.";    The
departing Americans left behind a town of morose merchants, dispirited tavern
owners and idle bar girls at establishments with names like The Happy Hooker,
The Zoo and, perhaps a bit too apt these days, Earthquake McGoon's.;    Out on
the highway, one vendor did a brisk business selling icy soda pop to the long
line of departing Americans; another hawked bags of potato chips from under a
highway bridge. It seemed an odd start to what appears to be a long, uncertain
summer for tens of thousands of people forced from their homes by an angry
volcano.;    "The mountain's going to determine how long this is going to
last," said Kenneth West, an Air Force master sergeant stuck in a
non-air-conditioned car in the steamy traffic jam with his wife and four boys.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The United States should tell the Philippines whether it stores nuclear
weapons at an air base threatened by a volcano, the chairman of the Philippine
Senate Foreign Relations Committee said today.;    Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani
was referring to warnings by an anti-bases activist that radiation
contamination could result if volcanic materials from the erupting Mount
Pinatubo spreads to any nuclear weapons that may be stored at nearby Clark Air
Base.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The United States refuses to say whether it keeps nuclear arms in the
Philippines.;    "There must be action because this may be affected by
Pinatubo," Shahani said. "This policy of neither confirming nor denying must
be changed. They should remove these nuclear weapons. It is very dangerous
with this (volcano) and I believe it would be OK to change the policy.";    On
Monday, nearly 15,000 Americans evacuated Clark after Mount Pinatubo, 10 miles
to the west, began rumbling. The volcano exploded and erupted Wednesday and
today.;    About 1,500 American security forces stayed behind to guard the
installation, while the rest went to Subic Bay naval base, 30 miles southwest
of Pinatubo.;    Shahani, sister of Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, said
diplomatic pressure should be exerted on Washington to relax the "no
confirmation" policy. She said she would consult her Senate colleagues on the
issue.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE ERUPTION of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines is likely to rank among the
six biggest volcanic eruptions of this century, the U.S. Geological Survey
said Monday.;    Survey officials said it probably would reach 5 or 6 on the
Volcano Explosivity Index, which ranks eruptions by how much pumice and ash
they produce, among other things. The highest possible rating is 10.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In contrast, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington was barely
a 5, said Dallas Peck, a volcanologist and director of USGS.;    Only two
volcanic eruptions this century have reached 6: Novarupta in Alaska, in 1911,
and Santa Maria Volcano in Guatemala, in 1902. Three others were rated 5:
Bezimianny in the Soviet Union, 1956; Cerro Azul in Chile, 1932; and Ksudach
in the USSR, 1907.;    At the height of the Mount Pinatubo eruption, a team of
USGS and Filipino scientists was forced to abandon its monitoring site at
Clark Air Base for a safer position 36 miles from the volcano, Peck said.
Researchers also lost radio contact with their instruments on the mountain,
which monitor earthquakes and changes in the shape of the ground.;    However,
the team returned to Clark Monday morning and was beginning to assess the
extent of mud and ash flows.;    Ash and rock now blanket an area 90 miles
around Pinatubo; at some points, debris flows near the volcano are many yards
thick, the survey said. And while clouds and debris have hampered
observations, it appears that the summit of the mountain is now gone, replaced
by a crater 1.2 miles in diameter.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; PHILIPPINES  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT WAS long past midnight and Conrado Tiamzon was sound asleep when this
farming village suddenly shook to the thundering roar of what sounded like
"1,000 carabao running at us.";   It was worse than any stampede of water
buffalo: It was a deadly gray torrent of rain-soaked volcanic sand and mud,
thick as wet cement, stinking of hot sulfur and rushing faster than a person
could run.  </LEADPARA>

MUD, ASHES THREATEN PHILIPPINES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For two hours, Tiamzon, his wife and two young children huddled on their
tin roof, crying and praying as the flood of smoking mud swirled higher and
higher. It didn't stop until it filled his concrete home, stopping just under
the eaves.;   "I am sure we will all die there," the gap-toothed, 36-year-old
farmer said, standing near rooftops poking from the mud.;   Santa Barbara died
instead, its simple homes and fertile fields buried under 10 feet of mud from
the Sept. 7 volcanic mudflow that roared 24 miles from the debris-covered
slopes of Mount Pinatubo. It was one of scores of villages and towns in
central Luzon that had survived the June 15 volcanic eruption -- the biggest
the world has seen this century -- only to find the aftermath far worse.;  
Largely ignored by politicians during last month's fierce debate about the
future of U.S. military bases here, Pinatubo's death and destruction has grown
dramatically. Indeed, most of the estimated 875 deaths now blamed on the
volcano occurred in the weeks after the June 15 eruption, not during it. The
majority of victims, 505 people in all, perished in crowded, squalid,
government evacuation camps. Nearly all were members of the primitive Aeta
tribes; two-thirds were Aeta children under age 4 who died from disease and
malnutrition.;   Also, the government says nearly 1.2 million people have lost
their homes, shops, farms or jobs to Pinatubo, double the initial toll. Up to
half a million refugees have flooded into Manila, increasing the overcrowded
capital's woes. More than two dozen towns and more than 200,000 acres of
farmland have been buried. Damage and rehabilitation costs, already in the
hundreds of millions of dollars, continue to grow.;   And the future is even
grimmer.;   "Unfortunately, it is going to get worse," said Raymundo
Punongbayan, head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.
"We expect major (mudflow) danger for at least five years. So many more towns
will be affected.";   Scientists say Pinatubo's eruption ejected an
astonishing 8 billion cubic meters of ash, sand and rocks, or enough to bury
463 square miles nearly 23 feet deep. The volcano has largely stopped
erupting, but most of the debris still sits on the upper slopes, threatening
to unleash massive, deadly avalanches each time it rains.;   So far, after two
months of almost daily rainfall, less than 10 percent of the debris has washed
down the eight rivers that drain the mountain. Up to half of the rest is
expected to roar down in coming rainy seasons. Some areas along the crowded
eastern slopes and below may be endangered and uninhabitable for a decade.;   
Not much can be done. Officials say it is senseless to rebuild most of the
bridges and roads, for example, since massive silting from the mudflows has
filled riverbeds, forcing the water over the banks. Emergency dredging and
dikes have fought a losing battle against the power of nature.;   "It's not
only a waste of money, it's a waste of time," said Bren Guiao, governor of
Pampanga province, one of three bearing the brunt of the mudflows.;   "No one
really knows what to do," agreed a Western expert who has studied the problem.
"It's an unstable environment. The rivers move with each major rain. We call
it the windshield effect. They're meandering back and forth.";   Thigh-deep
muddy water fills the streets of Bacolor, for example, a once-prosperous
trading center of 67,000 people 22 miles south of Pinatubo that escaped major
damage during the June eruption. In the last month, however, mud has buried
some neighborhoods 15 feet deep. Floods have ruined much of the rest, forcing
most residents to flee.;   "Every time it rains upstream, we get mud and
floods here," said Efren Blanco, a city official. "The town proper has become
a river.";   An all-out effort to contain the mudflows with structural dams
and dikes would cost billions of dollars that the impoverished Philippines
doesn't have. As a result, Balingit has been forced to make Solomon-like
decisions, ordering that protective dikes be built to funnel mud into three
already buried barrios. That action sparked repeated protests from villagers
armed with guns and machetes, angry that their ancestral land is being
sacrificed.;   Balingit said, "I cannot blame them, but I must decide for the
good of the majority.";   TENS OF thousands of people have built shantytowns
and makeshift tent camps along raised roads, often without medical care or
relief goods. More than 150,000 others still are crammed into government
evacuation centers.;   Mariano Suniga, a burly 59-year-old tailor from Santa
Inez, stands outside one evacuation center, hoping for answers. His wife has
been in the hospital since mud buried their barrio in mid-July. "She is in
shock," he said. "She became too nervous from the mud."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  U.S. and Philippine negotiators agreed Wednesday that the Americans will give
up Clark Air Base next year but can keep their naval station at Subic Bay for
10 more years.;    The agreement, however, must be ratified by two-thirds of
the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to U.S. bases is strong.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  U.S. TO LEAVE CLARK BASE, KEEP SUBIC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     News that the Americans were leaving Clark, one of the oldest and largest
U.S. bases overseas, came as a shock to residents of nearby cities.;    About
27,000 Filipinos depend on Clark for their livelihoods, and the U.S. Embassy
estimates the two bases together pumped about $1 billion into the Philippine
economy through salaries and spending by U.S. troops and their families.;   
Both installations, whose leases expire Sept. 16, were heavily damaged when
the Mount Pinatubo volcano, 10 miles west of Clark, began erupting last month
for the first time in 600 years.;    The volcano continued to spew ash over
both bases Wednesday, forcing international and domestic airports to close in
Manila, 60 miles to the south.;    Agreement on the future of the bases came
after 14 months of talks, which resumed after chief U.S. negotiator Richard
Armitage arrived Monday for the first time since the eruptions began.;    "We
have reached agreement on all major issues," U.S. spokesman Stanley Schrager
told reporters Wednesday.;    Schrager said Clark would be turned over to the
Philippines "not later than Sept. 16, 1992." That gives the Americans one year
for cleanup operations before the base reverts to the Philippine military.;   
Subic also suffered heavy damage from Mount Pinatubo but is located about 25
miles from the volcano, well beyond the 12-mile danger zone.;    The two sides
agreed that a joint committee would decide later how long the Americans can
take to vacate Subic at the end of the agreement. That left open the
possibility that the U.S. Navy could remain there longer than 10 years.;    In
the joint statement, the sides said the Philippines will receive $360 million
for both bases during the next fiscal year, a figure already submitted to
Congress by the Bush administration.;    The agreement faces an uncertain
future in the Philippine Senate, which resumes sessions Monday after an annual
vacation. Before the eruptions, more than half the senators expressed
opposition to any extension of the leases.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
anytime," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  </LEADPARA>

(publ. 6/12/91, pg. 2A);  Because of an editor's error, a story in Tuesday's
editions may have been misleading about the location of Mount Lassen. It is in
the Cascade Range, a continuation of the Sierra Nevada.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep
across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said. Also in peril are the 350,000
residents of Angeles City, where the air base is located, about 50 miles north
of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is
likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.;    Scientists
doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same
time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said.;    The five USGS
scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was
evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.;    The
researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today 
moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano,
where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    Mount Pinatubo is typical
of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire" on the Pacific coasts
of Asia and the Americas. (These volcanoes -- including Mount Lassen in the
Sierra Nevada, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in the Cascade Range --
arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath
another.);    Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have
yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St.
Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Until volcanologists' attention was drawn
to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not
been studied well.;    Waves of hot ash;  Other recent volcanoes that erupted
on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in
Colombia in 1985.;    If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary
means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash
-- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing
and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a really big eruption,
all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.; 
  Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal. That
is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;    Risk to planes;  Such ash
also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman
said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on
radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the
grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base. But winds of
the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash
directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity -- measured by
seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system
-- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman
said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's
slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days they fly above
the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    No link to Japan;  Their
predictions might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst
already. But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur
emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military
could return to the base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's
activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable
size.;    "No reputable scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between
the two, Lipman said.;    More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical
time, he noted. "Two out of 500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     "He's someone who eats it up," said Randy White, Harlow's friend and
colleague at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. "He's able to totally
concentrate in those sorts of situations.";    The eruptions at Mount Pinatubo
finally gave Harlow the chance to put his skills and experience to work saving
lives. When Harlow went to Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980,
geologists were still learning how to read the telltale earthquakes.
Bureaucratic delays kept Harlow from arriving at Nevado de Ruiz in Colombia
until a day after its 1985 eruption. Harlow and his team predicted the 1989
eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, but few lives were threatened in the
remote area.;    Three weeks ago, Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological
Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast
the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. One
crew gathered evidence of Pinatubo's earlier eruptions as clues to its
potential power.;    Harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs
around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly
pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption
is imminent.;    Pinatubo followed an almost textbook pattern over the past
six weeks. Gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas,
the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more
than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the
narrow valleys west of the volcano.;    Philippine and U.S. Air Force
officials ordered evacuations Monday.;    Since late Tuesday, Harlow's
colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the
bunker at Clark Air Base, but do not believe the team is in danger. The
eruption is on the west side of the mountain, with the summit shielding Clark.
Prevailing winds are also away from the base.;    "I'm not so concerned," said
Pauline Lord, Harlow's wife. "My husband is not unaccustomed to danger.";   
Lord said Harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an
undergraduate student at Dartmouth College and his professor took the entire
class to observe an eruption in Guatemala.;    "He's somebody who's fascinated
by that kind of energy," said Lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied
Harlow to several volcanoes. "It's wonderful to see that lava sloshing
around.";    Harlow's 5-year-old daughter, Megan, is not worried about her
father.;    "She knows Daddy is in the Philippines and that he's fixing a
volcano," Lord said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The Mount Pinatubo volcano was slowly rousing from 600 years of sleep.;   
Two months ago, when the drama began, scientists knew almost nothing about
this drowsy Philippine giant, swaddled in thick jungle and ignored by the
hundreds of thousands of people living around its flanks.;    They didn't know
it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption
of Mount St. Helens in Washington -- or that the debris from these eruptions
had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base.;    But with the first small
signs of trouble, researchers went on alert, throwing a network of instruments
around the restless mountain. And in a few frenzied weeks of investigation,
they learned enough to recommend evacuation of some 84,000 people.;    The
warning came just in time. A series of violent eruptions has rocked the
mountain since Wednesday, blowing ash and pumice 80,000 feet in the air and
sifting volcanic grit over villages 90 miles away. At least 101 people have
been killed, 150,000 Filipinos have crowded into refugee centers in Manila and
20,000 American military dependents and civilian workers are being evacuated
from the country. U.S. officials said the damage may lead them to permanently
close Clark Air Base.;    On Monday, scientists said much of the pressure
inside the volcano had dissipated and the worst may be over.;    Although
Pinatubo never erupted into the cataclysmic blow-up that some had feared, the
damage and death toll from related earthquakes, mudslides and falling ash and
pumice could have been far higher had scientists not recommended evacuation.
The successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has
come in the past decade.;    The basics are the same. Researchers still use
seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and
bulging of the ground that often spell danger.;    But the technology has
improved immensely:;    (check) Instruments are cheaper and more expendable,
so they can be deployed where they will do the most good -- right in the path
of the volcano's fury.;    (check) The instruments continually beam data to
scientists who are waiting a safe distance away. Before, they had to visit
their instruments and collect the data by hand.;    (check) Information is
routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation
quickly -- and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of
volcanoes.;    Researchers have also made strides in interpreting what they
see. "Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads," said Peter Lipman, a
volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;    These skills
were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the
past decade.;    "The 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the
number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring
information," said Steven Brantley, a geologist with the survey's Cascades
Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash. "It was a rather remarkable decade,
really.";    Scientists say the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57
people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in
volcano research.;    It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and
prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and
monitoring, said geologist Robert Tilling of USGS in Menlo Park.;    As a
result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories. One, in Washington,
keeps track of active volcanoes in the Cascades Range of the Pacific Northwest
and Northern California, including Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount
Hood, Mount Baker, Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen. The second is in Alaska,
where Redoubt Volcano put on a spectacular show in 1989 and 1990. A third
observatory has been operating in Hawaii since 1912.;    American scientists
have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world,
from Galunggung in Indonesia to Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, improving their
ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards. Such a quick response is crucial
because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been
adequately investigated and monitored.;    "Now," Tilling said, "we can go in
there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data
within a day or two.";    The blossoming research has in turn spurred
development of cheaper and more rugged instruments.;    Take tiltmeters.;   
Like glorified carpenters' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and
tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface.;    A
decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each. But after Mount St. Helens
blew, scientists looked for cheaper models. One was developed by James
Westphal, a well-known astronomer and gadgeteer at the California Institute of
Technology, who patterned it after an idea used in missile guidance systems.
Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped
out in eruptions.;    The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as
scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying.;    "Volcanoes are
probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet," said
Bernard Chouet, a seismologist at the USGS in Menlo Park.;    It's not unusual
for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes -- but those quakes can
have a variety of causes. Most are innocuous, caused by the cracking of rock
above pools of magma that, for the moment, aren't going anywhere. But others
are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation
for an eruption.;    In the past few years, Chouet said, seismologists have
learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way.
These patterns were successfully used to forecast the 1989 eruption of Redoubt
Volcano in Alaska, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo.;    But even
though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake
forecasts, they're far from foolproof.;    Some volcanoes give virtually no
warning. Even when they do, the decision to evacuate is difficult and
expensive. In the Philippines, for instance, vandals looted parts of Clark Air
Base that were left unguarded. Factories and businesses shut down; crops and
livestock were left unattended.;    This time the evacuation paid off,
possibly averting a number of deaths. But it won't always. In the end, every
volcano is a rugged individualist, with its own distinct patterns of activity.
Some wake up, make threatening noises for weeks or months, then drift back to
sleep.;    The burden of deciding whether to warn the public weighs heavily on
scientists.;    Randall White, another seismologist with the USGS in Menlo
Park, recalled how he felt while working near the freezing summit of
Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz six years ago.;    Struggling to hear their
instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues
warned local officials that an eruption was on its way. But their warnings
were vain. For reasons that are still unclear, the officials did not order an
evacuation, and 22,000 people died after lava spewed from the volcano, melting
glaciers and forming devastating mudslides.;    "I found it nerve-racking,"
White said. "We were literally afraid to go to sleep at night, thinking that
some technician would get the interpretation (of the incoming data) wrong, and
a lot of people would die.";  Tools give clues that can save lives;    The
basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were
10 years ago. Scientists can move in fast and set up instruments that
continually broadcast readings, which are then analyzed by computer. This
allows quicker evaluation of volcano hazards -- and forecasts that can save
lives.; 1. Surveying: Researchers measure the volcano, with optical
instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as
a result of magma rising inside. They also put tiltmeters near the volcano's
vent to record changes in the slope of the ground.; 2. Pick and shovel:
Geologists dig through layers of old ash and lava to determine how often a
volcano erupted in the past -- a clue to what it might do in the future. The
thicker and more extensive the deposit, the bigger the eruption.; 3.
Seismometer: Measures ground shaking. Volcanoes often produce swarms of small
earthquakes. Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from
those caused by magma rising toward the surface -- a sign of impending
eruption.; 4. Spectrometer: First developed to measure pollutants from factory
smokestacks, it is now also used to measure sulfur dioxide in the smoke
belched by volcanoes. Increasing levels of the gas may signal an impending
eruption. The amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano,
and thus the potential size of the eruption.;    Sources: Robert Tilling and

<LEADPARA>  The top commander of U.S. forces in the Philippines said Wednesday that the
United States intends to keep two major military bases that have been heavily

<TEXT>     Mercer, the base's U.S. commander, said he hoped that many dependents
evacuated to the United States after Mount Pinatubo's most powerful eruption
June 15 would be able to return in July.;    The optimistic assessment came as
the volcano, about 25 miles northeast of Subic and 10 miles west of Clark Air
Base, continued to spout plumes of ash more than six miles high and rocked the
area with frequent earth tremors.;    More than 330 Filipinos have been
reported killed by the volcanic discharges, most of them crushed in homes and
buildings that collapsed under the weight of falling ash.;    With falling ash
near Clark preventing air operations and expected to continue up to a year or
more, the future of the huge air base is in doubt, diplomats have said.
Dependents of Air Force personnel living on or near the base have been sent
back to the United States. All but about 2,500 of the 7,000 service personnel
assigned there have been evacuated, and the few aircraft that were still based
at Clark have been flown elsewhere.;    At Subic, which is considered a more
vital installation, some facilities are operating despite a heavy ash fall.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; CLEANUP; FORECAST; PHILIPPINES  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  As thousands of U.S. military dependents left bases covered with ash from
Mount Pinatubo, Filipinos today confronted monumental chores that began with
securing clean drinking water.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said the volcano was
"simmering down" after a week of violent eruptions.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MONUMENTAL CLEANUP IS NEEDED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Significant, critical eruptions are probably over," the institute
announced.;    Punongbayan said he might recommend reducing the 25-mile danger
zone around the volcano, but he cautioned that Pinatubo remained a threat. The
institute said it would continue its alert at least until the volcano had
remained quiet for a week.;    The Philippine Red Cross said at least 101
people have been killed since the 4,795-foot volcano began spewing ash, steam
and super-heated rocks June 9 for the first time in 600 years.;    Most of the
victims were killed in a huge explosion Saturday that dumped ash as far as 375
miles away. The damage was aggravated by rains, and scores of buildings
collapsed in nearby towns and cities.;    At least 20 people were missing
today. Relief efforts have been complicated by impassable roads and ash clouds
that grounded aircraft all weekend.;    Defense Undersecretary Eduardo Ermita
said food was in short supply in the affected areas and water supplies had
been polluted by ash. Officials ordered Manila's fire department to transport
drinking water to towns hit hardest by the volcano.;    In Japan, a volcano
that claimed at least 39 lives earlier this month burst back to life today,
sending a torrent of hot rocks down the mountainside and spewing ash over a
hot springs resort.;    There were no reports of casualties from the latest
blast of Mount Unzen, but the Meteorological Agency warned of the likelihood
of additional eruptions of lava chunks and super-heated gas and rocks.;   
Since the fatal June 3 blast, volcanic ash from Mount Unzen has blanketed the
town of Shimabara at the eastern foot of the 4,480-foot volcano, 610 miles
southwest of Tokyo.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The Philippines said today that the U.S. Navy will withdraw from Subic Bay
Naval Base by the end of 1992, closing the largest American naval installation
in East Asia and the last American base in this former U.S. colony.;  
President Corazon Aquino's chief aide, Franklin Drilon, made the announcement
at a news conference after he and U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner failed to iron
out differences, including Manila's ban on nuclear weapons at the facility.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  U.S. NAVY TO ABANDON SUBIC BAY BY END OF 1992,
PHILIPPINES SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The friendly and cordial relations between the United States and the
Philippines will continue," Drilon said. "Both governments will continue to
build on this strong bond of friendship between the two countries.";   The
announcement ends nearly a century of U.S. military presence in this country,
which began when the United States seized the islands from Spain in 1898.;  
Clark Air Base, the other major U.S. installation, was closed last month after
it was damaged by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.;   Drilon said there was
nothing to preclude future talks on a longer withdrawal after a new Philippine
government takes office June 30.;   But U.S. officials have indicated that
further talks are unlikely and that they will begin pulling out troops in
strength after the base's three dependent schools close June 12.;   No
immediate comment was available from Washington.;   The 60,000-acre base 50
miles west of Manila has about 5,800 troops and 4,500 dependents.;   Closing
of the base will cost thousands of Filipinos their jobs. Most of the 300,000
residents of Olongapo, adjacent to Subic, rely on the base for their
livelihood.;   Nearby Zambales province is reeling from the devastating
effects of the June eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, which damaged Subic and
forced the United States to abandon Clark Air Base.;   In September the
Philippine Senate rejected a 10-year lease for Subic in return for $203
million in annual aid.;   The Philippines insisted the United States honor
constitutional prohibitions against nuclear weapons on Philippine soil and
also provide a detailed plan for withdrawing.;   The United States refuses to
say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Subic, although it is widely assumed
that ships calling at the port carry them.;   Philippine officials noted that
President Bush already had pledged to remove tactical nuclear weapons from
surface warships.;   Subic, the Navy's major supply and repair facility in the
western Pacific, provided logistical support for Seventh Fleet operations in
the Pacific and Indian Ocean.  </TEXT>
