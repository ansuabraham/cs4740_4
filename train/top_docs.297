<HEAD>University Team Discovers `Whale Dinosaur' And Late-Surviving
Brontosaurus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expedition has discovered remains of a
gigantic ``whale dinosaur'' and a brontosaurus that lived more
recently than other known dinosaurs of its type, scientists
announced.
   University of Colorado Paleontologist Robert Bakker said
Wednesday that the two finds in the fertile dinosaur fields of
southern Wyoming are providing important clues about dinosaur
extinction.
   Bakker said the remains of a 70-foot-long Haplocanthosaurus, a
member of the cetiosaur or ``whale dinosaur'' family, were found in
the Como Bluffs area near McFadden, Wyo., last July.
   The team also is excavating a brontosaurus that is the only one
of its kind known to have survived the Cretaceous Period that began
about 135 million years ago. The excavation is under way near Rock
River, Wyo., in a fossil deposit known as the Breakfast Bench. Rock
River is just a few miles north of Como Bluff.
   Bakker said that before this discovery, no brontosaurus had ever
been unearthed that was less than about 137 million years old.
   ``This means the Golden Book of Dinosaurs will need a slight
footnote, since this particular animal apparently managed to slide
just under the tag into the Cretaceous,'' he said.
   The brontosaurus bones were found last May by Don Kralis, a high
school science teacher from Leadville who has been assisting Bakker
with his Wyoming fieldwork.
   ``Finding this brontosaurus was a big surprise,'' Bakker said.
``Our initial reaction was that the animal was stuck in the wrong
time zone.''
   The whale dinosaur or cetiosaur, dubbed the ``Carlin Giant,''
was found by James Filla, an expedition volunteer and physicist at
the National Institute of Science and Technology in Boulder. The
find included a shoulder, thigh, tailbone, hand, forearm, shin and
several vertebrae from both the Carlin Giant and another small
specimen.
   The Carlin Giant is the largest member of cetiosaur family ever
unearthed, Bakker said.
   ``It's not surprising that this particular animal was so big
because it appears to be the last in its line,'' Bakker said. ``As
a rule, the large dinosaurs tended to get larger before they went
extinct, and we seem to have caught the last gasp of the
cetiosaur.''
   Cetiosaurs, large plant-eaters that were common during the late
Jurassic Period about 150 million years ago, apparently were the
victim of a worldwide catastrophe that struck about that time, said
Bakker.
   ``One after another, the giant dinosaur families died out, and
the cetiosaurs were the first to go,'' Bakker said. ``As far as we
know, this was the first major extinction of a large dinosaur
family during the late Jurassic.''
   He said his paleontology team's work at Como Bluff has
determined the cetiosaurs were the first dinosaur family to die off
in a one-by-one, ``stepwise'' extinction sequence. It spanned a
period beginning 150 million years ago and ending 66 million years
ago.
   ``Stepwise patterns just don't agree with the popular theory
that a cataclysmic disaster suddenly wiped out the dinosaurs,''
Bakker said. ``The fossil record clearly indicates that these mass
extinctions were not the result of one Saturday night of cosmic
mayhem.''

   The nation's paleontologists, who know a
dinosaur when they see one, are upset over the U.S. Postal
Service's latest block of dinosaur stamps.
   One of the stamps uses an out-of-date name and another actually
shows a flying reptile, complain the scientists who study ancient
forms of life.
   In its own defense the Postal Service produced a letter from a
Maryland seven-year-old to whom the identity of the animals was
perfectly clear.
   And as for calling the set ``dinosaur'' stamps, officials say
that term is simply the easiest for people to understand.
   The stamps were selected in an effort to join in the current
interest in dinosaurs among young people, and they are being
featured as part of the Postal Service's annual ``Stamp Collecting
Month'' promotion.
   The four 25-cent stamps include a tyrannosaurus, a large fierce
reptile, and a stegosaurus, or plated lizard, with a row of large
plates on its back. Neither of those raised any complaints from the
paleontologists.
   But the other two show a brontosaurus, a large-bodied lizard
with long neck and tiny head, and a pteranodon, a flying reptile,
   That means that one of the stamps, the pteranodon, doesn't
picture a dinosaur at all, complained the paleontologists.
   And the brontosaurus actually is an apatosaurus, they said.
   While promoting the dinosaur stamps in their advertising, postal
officials admit that the pteranodon isn't technically a dinosaur.
   The Postal Service's book ``Introduction to Stamp Collecting,''
which is being used in the stamp promotion, refers to the stamps as
the ``prehistoric animals series'' and notes that the group of
stamps portrays ``three dinosaurs and a pteranodon, a winged
creature that ruled the skies while dinosaurs ruled the land.''
   The Paleontological Society is more upset about the brontosaurus
stamp, however, having gone so far as to issue a statement
detailing the correct name for the animal.
   The brontosaurus never existed, having actually been the result
of a 19th century researcher mixing up the skull of one prehistoric
animal with the body bones of another, the paleontologists say. The
body skeleton had already been named apatosaurus, the scientists
noted.
   In the past 15 years or so museums have corrected the problem,
joined the correct skulls with the skeletons of the animals, and
changed the designation to apatosaurus.
   By scientific convention, the paleontologists state, ``when more
than one name is given to a species only the oldest name is
scientifically valid. As a consequence, use of the name
brontosaurus must be discontinued.''
   In its defense, the Postal Service noted that its booklet on
stamps uses both names, and the agency produced a letter from
7-year-old Brandon Dennis of Laurel, Md., who had read about the
controversy in a Washington newspaper.
   ``I like the name brontosaurus because it means thunder lizard,
not deceptive lizard like apatosaurus,'' wrote Brandon.
   After citing a several books using the term brontosaurus, he
concluded that ``it's all right to use brontosaurus because most
kids, including my sister, know that brontosaurus and apatosaurus
are the same creature.''

<HEAD>Dinosaur Remains Stir More Debate Over Cause of Dinosaur
Extinction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The discovery of two giant dinosaurs in Wyoming is
reigniting debate over why the huge beasts became extinct.
   Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker, who led the team that
found the dinosaur remains, said Thursday the discoveries reinforce
his theory that dinosaurs became extinct gradually.
   A scientist at the Smithsonian Institution who supports the
theory that dinosaurs met their end suddenly, in a cosmic
collision, says the latest finds prove nothing of the sort.
   The extinction of dinosaurs is ``a big area of controversy right
now in science,'' said Dr. Richard Stucky, paleontologist at the
Denver Museum of Natural History.
   Scientists offer dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinctions, including a change in the Earth's motion, famine,
parasites, poisons, climatic changes, meteorites and even
extraterrestrial hunters.
   The debate is on again since Bakker's team of University of
Colorado scientists unearthed a 70-foot-long, 25-foot-high
Haplocanthosaurus. A member of the cetiosaur or ``whale dinosaur''
family. The ``Carlin Giant'' found near McFadden, Wyo., was the
largest cetiosaur ever located, Bakker said.
   The second find is the only brontosaurus scientists have placed
in the Cretaceous Period, which began 135 million years ago.
   Before that discovery, near Rock River, Wyo., in a fossil
deposit known as Breakfast Bench, no brontosaur had been found that
was less than 137 million years old.
   Bakker announced the discoveries Wednesday. The remains were
found last summer.
   ``The fossil record clearly indicates that these mass
extinctions were not the result of a Saturday night of cosmic
mayhem,'' Bakker said. ``The last remains of different (dinosaur)
families are strewn through millions of years of rock,'' he said.
   Nicholaus Hotton, a curator of paleobiology at the Smithsonian
Institution, disagrees. He still subscribes to a collision theory,
which he said is evidenced by iridium-rich sediments in the
deposits marking the end of the Cretaceous Period. Iridium is a
heavy metal found in platinum ores.
   ``The crustal rocks in the top kilometers of the earth are very
poor in iridium, but meteors and things are very rich in iridium.
So why do you find that in that zone?'' Hotton said.
   ``The argument is that they were brought in from the outside ...
an asteroid, comet, or one hell of a big meteorite that struck the
Earth. And in doing so it disrupted the ecology,'' he said.
   Bakker believes extensive migration and subsequent disease
epidemics may have wiped out dinosaurs. He said Hotton is missing
the ``frog facts.''
   ``If a comet or asteroid hit the earth and killed all the
dinosaurs, how then were the deaths so selective?'' he asked. ``The
fact (is) that the little delicate animals - like frogs - survived
and the large aggressive animals didn't.''
   According to Bakker, dinosaurs became extinct because of
worldwide diseases.
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he said.
   The cetiosaur bones eventually will be displayed at the
University of Wyoming and at North Carolina State University, which
assisted the fieldwork. The brontosaurus is still being unearthed.

   Small land animals _ including the
ferocious 6-ounce ``Mutant Ninja Chipmunk'' _ thrived while an
environmental crisis killed off most giant dinosaurs more than 100
million years ago, a researcher found.
   Dr. Robert Bakker, a University of Colorado paleontologist, said
fossils recently unearthed from a 130-million-year-old deposit in a
rock quarry in Wyoming showed small dinosaurs, mammals, turtles and
other animals flourished in the early Cretaceous period a few
million years after the giant dinosaurs that lived in the Jurassic
period became extinct.
   ``The new fossils are the remains of animals that lived in a
crisis interval during the early Cretaceous Period, and this is the
first rock layer that seems to record just what happened and why,''
Bakker said Wednesday.
   His preliminary findings were published April 15 in the
proceedings of the Fourth North American Paleontological Congress.
   With several colleagues, Bakker, who first identified the fossil
beds in the 1970s, unearthed a wide array of ``fossil miniatures''
from the 10- to 12-foot thick deposit known as ``Breakfast Bench''
near the town of Rock River.
   The specimens date to the earliest part of the Cretaceous
period, a transitional period following the demise of long-necked,
giant dinosaurs such as brontosaurus, supersaurus and diplodocus.
   Bakker said the deposit provides evidence of a classic case of
``David and Goliath'' _ a variety of diminutive creatures
overshadowed the great dinosaurs for a time.
   After the dinosaurs evolved into a new line of giants, again
eclipsing small animals, the same scenario apparently was played
out about 65 million years later at the end of the Cretaceous
period, when another catastrophe of some kind killed off all
dinosaurs.
   New species unearthed at the site include a 20-pound herbivorous
dinosaur, a pair of fierce rodent-like mammals weighing less than a
pound each and a neurologically sophisticated turtle, Bakker said.
Numerous crocodilian remains also were found, he said.
   The sudden appearance of Zofiabaatar, a 6-ounce furry meat-eater
that Bakker nicknamed the ``Mutant Ninja Chipmunk,'' illustrates
small mammals were taking evolutionary advantage of the swampy
environment during the crisis, he said.
   Scientists have long been puzzled by the mass extinctions at the
end of the Jurassic period, and theories focus on such factors as
movements of the Earth, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes in
climate and meteorites.
   But according to Bakker, dinosaurs became extinct because of
worldwide diseases that turned into an ``epidemiological
nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he said.
   Big animals travel and are extremely vulnerable to disease,
Bakker said. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the
animals spread hundreds of diseases throughout all continents _
eventually killing the lot.
   ``If you're a species one of the most dangerous things you can
do is to invade a continent or have a foreign species move in,'' he
said. ``So the stay-at-homes have an automatic immunity to this
tourist trap of exotic disease.''
   The newly identified creatures apparently thrived in the swampy,
fern-choked environment that marked the end of the Jurassic and the
beginning of the Cretaceous periods, Bakker said.
   Since fern-choked swamps also were present at the end of the
Cretaceous and during times of other mass die-offs, they may help
explain why dinosaurs and other large land animals suffered
repeated extinctions.
   ``Scientists studying mass extinction are like criminologists
tracking a serial killer _ the clues that finally catch the killer
usually come from the repeated pattern in the way the crimes were
committed,'' Bakker said.

FOSSILS OF NEW SPECIES ADD TO MYSTERY OF DEMISE OF DINOSAURS

Fossils of at least four new species of animals discovered in Wyoming cast 
doubt on the theory that comets colliding with the Earth killed off some 
dinosaurs 130 million years ago and all dinosaurs 65 million years later, a 
Colorado paleontologist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new species include a 20-pound herbivorous dinosaur, a bizarre mammal that 
the researchers have nicknamed a "mutant ninja chipmunk" and a "high-tech" 
turtle. They flourished after the large dinosaurs that preceded them were 
exterminated 130 million years ago by an unknown environmental catastrophe, 
said Robert Bakker of the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers believe that cometary collisions produced highly acidic 
rainfall and cold temperatures that led to the dinosaurs' decline. But 
discoveries at the new site cast doubt on that proposal because other reptiles 
and fish, which should have been affected by the cold and acid, proliferated 
while the dinosaurs died out. 
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism (of extinction) obviously needs to be rethought," said Bakker, 
who is considered by many paleontologists to be a maverick in the profession. 
</P>
<P>
It is not widely appreciated that dinosaurs went through two distinct periods 
of dominance. During the late Jurassic Period, which extended up to 130 million 
years ago, the largest dinosaurs were well-known varieties such as the 
long-necked brontosaurus, the spike-backed stegosaurus and the fierce, 
carnivorous allosaurus. 
</P>
<P>
These species died off at the end of the Jurassic, to be replaced by small 
dinosaurs that evolved into the iguana-like iguanodons, the dome-headed 
dinosaurs and the largest land-based predator ever to exist, Tyrannosaurus rex 
-- all of which were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This dramatic change in the evolutionary cast of characters (between the 
Jurassic and Cretaceous) is one of the most profound crises in dinosaur 
development," Bakker said. "The new fossils are the remains of animals that 
lived in a crisis interval during the early Cretaceous period, and this is the 
first rock layer (containing the fossils) that seems to record just what 
happened and why." 
</P>
<P>
That rock layer, known as the Breakfast Bench, lies in Wyoming's Albany County, 
near the town of Rock River. Bakker has been studying the site since 1974, but 
the bones obtained there, he said, "are so small that I misidentified them at 
first." It was only when he and his colleagues found an almost complete 
skeleton of a 20-pound dinosaur now called Drinker nisti "that I realized what 
we had been getting and the new species kind of jelled." 
</P>
<P>
The fossil bed indicates that the region was swampy and fern-choked at the end 
of the Jurassic. Similar conditions prevailed at the end of the Cretaceous and 
at the end of the Permian period 250 million years ago, when another extinction 
occurred before dinosaurs existed. Swamps have also been associated with other, 
smaller extinctions, Bakker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we have a 'serial killer' here that has something to do with 
swamps," he said. "We're not ready for convictions yet, but we certainly have 
enough evidence for an indictment." He speculates that the dinosaurs were 
killed by disease as they moved into new environments in response to climate 
change. 
</P>
<P>
But, noted geologist Walter Alvarez of UC Berkeley, there is "overwhelming 
evidence" that a cometary impact did occur at the end of the Cretaceous period. 
"We may never know precisely what the killing mechanisms were, but it would 
require a breathtaking coincidence to say that a gigantic impact had nothing to 
do with a gigantic extinction," said Alvarez, a long-time proponent of the 
impact theory of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Paleobiologist Hans Sues of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of 
Natural History in Washington called Bakker's claim about a serial killer 
"wild," but noted that Bakker "does have a very interesting new dinosaur and 
little animals there." 
</P>
<P>
Bakker has been criticized in the past for making strong claims in the media 
and for not publishing his results in refereed journals. The current findings 
were published recently in the Proceedings of the Fourth North American 
Paleontological Congress, a non-refereed journal. The fact that a paper is 
unrefereed means that other scientists have not subjected it to critical 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The fossil strata also show that while large land animals died off, smaller 
aquatic species and reptiles did not. "If a meteorite hit, it would cause a 
sudden chill and acid rain that would kill off turtles and frogs right away," 
Bakker said. "But the frogs didn't disappear. Neither did the turtles. In fact, 
the whole aquatic ecosystem bloomed and did fine. That's a very powerful clue 
about what happened." Bakker is not sure, however, what caused the swamps to 
form. 
</P>
<P>
The most common dinosaur to be found at Breakfast Bench was the new D. nisti, 
he said. It was equipped with the most complicated leaf-cutting teeth ever to 
evolve among dinosaurs. The animal's large, spreadable hind feet were adapted 
to walking on soggy ground. 
</P>
<P>
Baby D. nisti specimens, with body and leg bones as small as pigeons', are 
among the smallest dinosaurs ever found, Bakker said. "You can put a pile of 
their bones on a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Zofiabaatar, a ferocious eight-ounce mammal, has been nicknamed the "mutant 
ninja chipmunk" by Bakker. The animal apparently killed lizards and other small 
prey with its mouse-like front teeth, then sliced up the bodies with its long, 
saw-edged rear teeth. 
</P>
<P>
It was a member of a group of mammals known as multituberculates -- primarily 
insect eaters and herbivores that have no relatives living today. "The mutant 
ninja chipmunk apparently made an evolutionary hard right turn" to become a 
carnivore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foxraptor was a furry, even smaller animal with a bulldog snout designed for 
attacking large bugs and small vertebrates. The fourth new species, Uluops, was 
a "high-tech" turtle boasting a skull architecture far more advanced that its 
contemporary cousins. 
</P>
<P>
The largest common animal in the Breakfast Bench strata was the "giant 
crushing-tooth lungfish," a half-ton predator with huge, flat teeth shaped like 
mittens for cracking hard-shelled prey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW SPECIES FOUND 
</P>
<P>
Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker has discovered four new species that date 
from 130 million years ago. Two -- the Foxraptor and the Zofiabaatar -- are 
small but ferocious mammals. One -- the Uluops -- is a neurologically 
sophisticated turtle. The fourth -- the Drinker -- is a 20-pound plant-eating 
dinosaur.

   Scientists from China and Canada said today that
they unearthed a mass grave of sheep-sized baby dinosaurs who were
apparently buried during a sandstorm 75 million years ago.
   Dr. Philip Currie, of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in
Alberta, said the joint team excavated the skulls of five baby
Pinacosaurus in the wastelands of southern Inner Mongolia.
   He said they found a sixth baby on the last day of their summer
expedition, ``and it appears likely there are a number of other
specimens.''
   One adult, which in life was ``about the size of an extremely
heavy bull,'' was also discovered nearby, he said.
   ``We feel that the five babies were congregating together behind
a sand dune in a sandstorm,'' Currie said. Either they were buried
by sand or killed by the collapsing dune, he said.
   Currie said it was first time the plant-eating reptile had been
found to be ``gregarious,'' or living and moving in groups.
   The Canada-China Dinosaur Project, working together for the
second straight summer in the fertile and largely untouched
dinosaur fields of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in China's far west,
found the remains of about 50 other dinosaurs and their nests, and
40 other mammals, turtles and lizards.
   The Bayan Manduhau area of southern Inner Mongolia where the
babies were dug up was first explored by American and Swedish
paleontologists in 1928 and 1931. This year's find was in a spot
that was inaccessible at that time because of lack of roads.
   Hou Lianhai of the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, said the team in
Xinjiang had excavated a meat-eating theropod but needed another
year to dig up a brontosaurus-like sauropod.
   Both beasts were discovered in Xinjiang during the first
expedition last year. The sauropod, about 160 million years old and
estimated to have been 100 feet long, is one of the largest of its
kind to have been found in Asia, Hou said.
   At a news conference, Currie and Hou also revealed one nearly
intact oblong-shaped egg, about eight inches long, and several
broken egg shells of the Protoceratops, a pig-sized horned dinosaur.
   Currie said the year's finds will help understand the histories
of dinosaurs in Asia and North America. He said the fossils
discovered in Inner Mongolia were the same age as those found in
Alberta, another great repository of dinosaurs, and that many of
the same kinds of reptiles were turning up.
   He said it was still not clear whether the dinosaurs migrated
from either the dry, dune-coursed Asian deserts or the wetter lands
of North America, or whether they may have developed independently.
   The dinosaur project is to return to China again next year and
in the future may carry out further research in either China or
northern Canada. Noble said there are also plans to stage a world
tour of dinosaur fossils from around 1991.
   The project is coordinated by the Ex-Terra Foundation and
supported by the Canadian government.

   A 70-foot dinosaur known as ``Happy'' stood
prominently on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History
for nearly 25 years before researchers discovered it was a new
species.
   Four months before it announced that finding in July, the museum
said it had discovered a new dinosaur, Nanotyrannus _ based on a
skull that had been in the basement for decades.
   This spring, a California researcher found the fossil remains of
a marine reptile called a Masasaur, so well-preserved that the 75
million-year-old animal still had scales on its skin and food in
its stomach. It was in a Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County warehouse.
   Paleontologists say the finds aren't surprising. Museum
storerooms have become rich hunting grounds for new species because
a lack of money and staff has delayed the identification of bones
excavated up to 60 years ago.
   ``In general, paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it
can be prepared,'' said Michael E. Williams, who helped identify
``Happy,'' a 140-million-year-old relative of the Brontosaurus.
``There are museums ... which have skeletons still in plaster
jackets going back to the turn of the century.''
   Researchers at the Cleveland museum had determined that
``Happy'' was a Haplocanthosaurus, but didn't realize it
represented a new and larger species _ and named it ``delfsi''
after the researcher who found the bones 30 years ago _ until they
recently had time to study it more closely.
   ``Literally there is so much material to collect and save from
weathering and erosion that we are just decades behind,'' said
Lawrence G. Barnes, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. ``I could walk in to
the Smithsonian or any museum and find 80 or 90 new species of
whales or dolphins, which is my specialty.''
   Barnes estimated that the museum had 300 to 400 plaster jackets
in storage, encasing everything from dinosaurs to mammoths, and
that 75 percent of the museum's collection has not been examined
closely.
   Even at the well-funded Smithsonian Institution, it took half a
century to study and identify fossils excavated by 19th century
dinosaur researcher O.C. Marsh that form the bulk of the museum's
collection, according to research curator Nicholas Hotton.
   ``When Marsh died, we got seven big, big train carloads of
dinosaur bones,'' Hotton said. Researcher C.W. Gilmor worked on
Marsh's fossils for nearly 50 years, and ``there is a bunch of
stuff Gilmor didn't get to.''
   Fossils stored at the Smithsonian have almost all been
identified, he said. ``We don't anticipate any surprises, but
that's silly because we can always get surprised.''
   Field Museum of Natural History researchers in Chicago have
spent 10 years working through the collection of unstudied fossils,
some of them in storage for decades, said John Bolt, chairman of
the geology department.
   ``We've made quite a bit of progress at reducing that backlog,''
Bolt said.
   Mary Dawson, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
in Pittsburgh, said some of the fossils still stored in plaster
jackets at the museum date to 1922. With only five paleontologists
on the staff, many of those blocks will have to remain in storage.
   Four years ago, a National Science Foundation grant let Carnegie
researchers open an old plaster block. They found the only known
complete hind foot of a stegosaurus.
   ``We liken our collection to an iceberg, with one-tenth above
the surface and the rest waiting for study,'' Miss Dawson said.
   Most of the work done at the museum is based on specimens the
researchers collect themselves, so much of the collection in
storage will remain unstudied, she said. ``We know we should stay
home and study the collections we already have, but it's such a
challenge to get out in the field.
   ``We're really putting apples back on the tree when we do this.''

<HEAD>Man Who Put Up Famed Roadside Dinosaurs Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claude K. Bell, whose dinosaur creations
became a landmark to millions of Southern California desert
travelers, has died at 91, but his family vowed that his fanciful
``dinosaur garden'' would live on.
   Bell died Monday of pneumonia at Humana Hospital in Anaheim.
   Bell and his dinosaurs have been featured in People magazine,
the film ``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' and a book titled ``The
Well-Built Elephant and Other Roadside Attractions _ A Tribute to
American Eccentricity.''
   The retired amusement park sculptor spent more than two decades
and $300,000 creating the giant creatures _ a 150-ton, concrete
brontosaurus named Dinney and a 100-ton tyrannosaurus named Rex _
on an otherwise desolate stretch of Interstate 10 near Palm Springs.
   The towering dinosaurs can be seen for miles by travelers
approaching the tiny community of Cabazon on the desert route
between Phoenix and Los Angeles.
   ``The dinosaurs aren't dead and they never will be,'' Bell's
daughter, Wendy Murphy of Costa Mesa, said. ``He wanted to build a
monument that would withstand the sands of time, and he has done
that.''
   Bell, a retired sculptor for Orange County's popular Knott's
Berry Farm amusement park, was in his mid-60s when he first began
building the steel-framed, 150-foot-long brontosaurus on 60 acres
of desert land he owned at Cabazon.
   It was meant to be the first of several figures in his Dinosaur
Garden theme park. Plans to add a giant mastodon and a sabre-tooth
tiger are on the drawing board.
   The park, which includes a museum and gift shop, is run by
Bell's son-in-law, Denny Rowing.
   Bell is survived by his wife, Anna Marie, a son, five daughters,
14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

   Fossils of some of the dinosaurs that have been
found in the Morrison Formation include:
   _Apatosaurus: Popularly known as the brontosaurus, one of the
best-known dinosaurs. The 70-foot-long creature had a heavy body
and legs and a long neck and tail.
   _Diplodocus: Ninety feet long with most of the length from the
long, thin neck and long, whip-like tail. Its name, which means
``double beam,'' describes a special feature of the backbone, a
piece of small bone that pointed forward as well as the normal
piece that pointed back.
   _Stegosaurus: Had a tiny, tubular skull with a brain the size of
a walnut. It had small, flat plates on its neck and bigger
diamond-shaped plates on its back and the first part of its tail.
It grew up to 30 feet long.
   _Allosaurus: The largest carnivore in North America in the late
Jurassic Period. It may have fed on other well-known dinosaurs. It
was different from other meat-eating dinosaurs in the shape of its
skull, which had a ridge along the top that ran from between the
eyes to the tip of the snout. It was 35 feet long.
   _Camarasaurus: A heavily built suaropod with a shorter tail and
neck than the apatosaurus or diplodocus. Its head was short with a
blunt snout, and its nostrils were on the top of its head. Those
features have led scientists to believe it could have lived in
water. It generally grew to 60 feet long.

been around at least 200 years and still has wide currency.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DOES DINOSAUR THEORY FLY?  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     The possible link between the dinosaurs of 140 million years ago and
today's birds is explored on PBS this week in a fascinating edition of the
"Nova" series called "The Case of the Flying Dinosaur." The show, second of
three "Nova" episodes about dinosaurs, plays Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Channel 9.; 
  The dinosaur/bird theories spring from scientific attempts to search out the
origin of birds by studying fossils from the Mesozoic Era.;    Scientists can
see links between existing birds and reptiles -- such as the presence of
scales and births from hard-shelled eggs -- but there are many differences,
too, between cold-blooded reptiles and warm-blooded birds.;    Yet
well-preserved fossils of bird-like reptiles first found in German limestone
quarries in the 18th century inspired some renowned scientists, including
Thomas Huxley, to believe they were evidence of an evolutionary turn taken by
dinosaurs.;    Most of the "flying dinosaur" partisans believe that
prehistoric reptiles that ran or leaped to grab prey gradually acquired the
ability to fly. Others think it's more likely the dinosaur ancestors of birds
were tree-climbing reptiles that developed wings to "sail" after prey.;    The
fossils that were central to the theory were those of creatures known as
archaeopteryx -- small, bird-like reptiles with wings. They promised to be the
"missing link" between dinosaurs and birds.;    Debate over the theory has
divided the scientific world for years, and the "Nova" episode explores both
sides of the controversy.;    "It's an enormously attractive idea," said bird
fossil expert Larry Martin about the dinosaur theory. "If I have a cage with a
parakeet in it, it's certainly a lot more fun to think that it's a small
tyrannosaurus." Martin is among those who believe birds originated
independently and probably existed side by side with dinosaurs. He thinks the
"flying dinosaur" theory is the result of inadequate study of the fossil
records.;    Latest challenge to the theory is the 1985 discovery of a new
bird-like fossil creature, tentatively dubbed "protoavis," which predates
archaeopteryx by millions of years, making it a contemporary of the dinosaurs
from which birds are supposed to have evolved. The first scientific papers
describing this creature are due this spring.;    Still, "Nova" stirs the
imagination with some carefully photographed scenes of contemporary birds that
do resemble dinosaurs when seen from the proper angle. Example: ostriches
browsing on a plain, looking like brontosauruses with feathers.;    This
edition of "Nova" replays the scene in "King Kong" where Kong beats up a
pterodactyl trying to make off with Fay Wray. But it warns against any leap to
the conclusion that pterodactyls were related to modern birds. The world of
science is unanimously of the opinion that birds didn't evolve from those
particular bat-winged reptiles. So when Steven Spielberg starts filming
Michael Crichton's novel "Jurassic Park," a fanciful story about dinosaurs
being cloned on an island off the coast of Central America, he probably should
omit the part about pterodactyls being kept in a giant aviary. (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Scientists Use `Dinobusting' Method to Help Dig Up Huge Dinosaur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A method developed to find buried toxic
waste is helping scientists dig up what may be the longest
fossilized dinosaur ever found, a 120-foot seismosaurus who died in
a river 145 million years ago.
   ``Something big in your neighborhood? Who ya gonna call?
Dinobusters!'' is the slogan inscribed on the T-shirt of Oak Ridge
National Laboratory researcher Alan Witten, who developed the
``dinobusting'' technique with about $500,000 from the U.S.
Department of Energy and the Army.
   The $1 million excavation is under way at a secret site
northwest of Albuquerque, N.M., where Witten's technique is used to
locate buried bones by making fuzzy pictures of them with sound
waves.
   ``What Alan is going to do is bring paleontology out of the 19th
century'' by making it faster, easier and cheaper to excavate large
fossils, said J. Wilson Bechtel, who supervises the dig with his
wife, Peggy. They direct the Southwest Paleontology Foundation in
Albuquerque.
   The Tennessee-based Witten discussed the dig and his technique
Thursday during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   Witten said the Energy Department and the Army's toxic materials
agency paid to develop the method so it could be used to find
buried toxic waste for cleanup, check the integrity of potential
toxic or nuclear waste dumps, and perhaps explore for coal seams.
   The method is similar to medical CT scans, which use X-rays and
detectors to make images of internal organs.
   To make images of buried seismosaurus bones, Witten said he
sends sound waves through the ground using ``an 8-gauge shotgun on
wheels, pointed down. It fires a soft metal slug that hits the
ground and flattens.''
   The sound waves are detected by a set of 29 microphones in a
nearby hole. The sound travels at different rates through rock and
bone. To make an image of one part of the dinosaur, the gun is
moved around and fired repeatedly, producing a two-dimensional
image of a bone's ``sound shadows.''
   The method is similar to that used to make holographs, Witten
said. The sound gun is a commercial kind used to search for oil by
studying the speed of sound waves bouncing off various underground
rocks, not by making an image, he added.
   Several tail vertebrae from the seismosaurus, a relative of
brontosaurus and diplodocus, were discovered by two hikers in 1979.
The exposed bones were excavated in June 1985 by David Gillette,
then paleontology curator at the New Mexico Museum of Natural
History and now Utah's state paleontologist.
   Gillette announced the find in August 1986, coining the name
seismosaurus, or ``earth shaker.''
   The seismosaurus lived in a hot, humid river delta much like
today's Mississippi, and ``probably laid down on a river sandbar
and was covered by sand rather rapidly'' after damming water
upstream, Bechtel said.
   The dinosaur's bones are still in the position where they were
when the animal died.
   Debate continues over whether the seismosaurus or a fossil
dinosaur found near Delta, Colo., is the biggest ever discovered.
Gillette said seismosaurus was at least 120 feet long and probably
longer, and Brigham Young University scientists have said their
dinosaur was at least 100 feet long and possibly 130 feet.
   Until the dinosaurs are excavated, ``it's all speculation,''
said Witten.
   Mrs. Bechtel said it will take at least one more year to
excavate the seismosaurus. So far, the team has removed the base of
the tail, vertebrae, pelvis and several ribs from beneath 8 feet of
sandstone.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: PREHISTORIC DREAM IN NEW ZEALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACQUES-YVES COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In New Zealand's Breaksea Sound, one of the longest fjords in the world, the 
coasts are steep, covered with forests and dripping with water. Calypso's stern 
dug into the bushy tree branches. It was raining, unrelentingly. Halfway to the 
top of the high mountains above us, patches of fog clung to the slopes. 
Vertiginous waterfalls cascaded down drenched mountain peaks that merged with 
the sky. Water was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It fell in raindrops. It hung in layers of fog. It soaked the forest, oozing 
out of the moss-covered ground, swallowing sap and rot. Then over the surface 
of the sound, it regurgitated a layer of yellowish and murky vegetal freshwater 
goo that floated on top of the deep and crystalline salt water. 
</P>
<P>
I took our small seaplane to land and walked through the deep, vertical forest. 
I maneuvered through the mud, proceeding with caution in a silence broken only 
by the patter of rain, the crackling of rotting branches and the melodic songs 
of bellbirds. 
</P>
<P>
There were evergreen beeches, shrubs with clustered leaves, and ferns 
everywhere -- the dwarf kind, the creeping kind, but also the very tall and 
arborescent kind. Networks of moss covered the ground, the tree trunks and the 
rocks. Everything was spongy. 
</P>
<P>
This welcoming forest, mild and soft to the touch, was defenseless against such 
animals as goats and deer. But scarcely two centuries have passed since humans 
brought goats, sheep, deer, rats and other mammals to New Zealand, that had 
otherwise evolved free of all mammalian life, free of the need of defense. 
</P>
<P>
I removed my gloves and found that, in contrast to the Amazon forest, here 
nothing prickled, nothing stung, nothing irritated the skin. There were no 
scorpions, no snakes, no tarantulas, no biting ants. And, except for perhaps an 
occasional tiny white orchid, obviously of recent date, even as I searched, all 
around me, I saw no flowers. 
</P>
<P>
I leaned on a forked tree limb and fell under the spell, escaping from the 
present world and traveling back in time, relying on daydreams as fragile as 
the half-rotten branch that supported me. Mystery, like the water, flowed 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I traveled back some 70 million years, when New Zealand broke away from the 
supercontinent of Gondwanaland that eventually divided into the continents of 
our time. I pictured New Zealand as a ship that broke loose from its parent, 
drifting, lashed by tremendous volcanic storms, constantly reshaped by the whim 
of shifting tectonic plates. The dinosaurs never invaded the region that would 
become this vessel, and so the castaway forests had not developed defenses 
against the formidable plant-eaters that most dinosaurs were. 
</P>
<P>
Then I travel back perhaps 130 million years, just before the appearance of the 
first flowers. This time I set foot on Gondwanaland itself to witness the havoc 
the dinosaurs wreaked on plants of all kinds. The vegetation had armed itself 
to no avail with ridiculous prickles to ward off the teeth of the 
brontosauruses and other diplodocuses. When the flowering plants did appear, 
they managed to survive because of their rapid reproduction. And these plants 
not only produced perfumes, but alkaloids and tannins -- odors and bitter 
chemicals capable of discouraging most herbivores. 
</P>
<P>
With that, I then fantasize that flowers could have caused dinosaurs to starve 
and vanish. I picture, with a smile, a giant brontosaurus spitting out a tender 
flower.

   As dinosaurs go, they were the biggest of the

   For more than a century, scientists have been
digging into a vast dinosaur graveyard in the Rocky Mountains,
unraveling the mysteries of the largest creatures ever to roam the
planet.
   Here lie the fossilized bones of dinosaurs that lived 140
million years ago when the Front Range was a great semi-arid
lowland with periods of rain and drought. Colorado was a flat
landscape with large meandering streams, vegetation and open spaces.
   Man was still 138 million years away.
   Called the Morrison Formation for a small town southwest of
Denver where the first dinosaur skeleton was found here in 1877,
the graveyard lies on either side of the Rocky Mountains from Idaho
south to New Mexico.
   Paleontologists call it ``the capital of dinosaur research.''
   In January, a Colorado expedition found a jaw and vertebrae
fragments west of Fort Collins that belonged to the rare,
meat-gulping hunter epanterias.
   Robert Bakker, a University of Colorado paleontologist who led
that team, says people weren't interested in dinosaurs before the
1877 discovery because they didn't know much about them. He said
that before the Colorado find there were ``miserable fragments'' of
fossils from Europe.
   ``The Morrison finds really put American science on the map and
continues to surprise us every field season,'' says Bakker, who has
been working on the formation since 1974.
   A group of preservation-minded people in Colorado has organized
``Friends of Dinosaur Ridge'' and is working with local and state
officials on a project to protect a famous Morrison Formation
outcropping southwest of Denver.
   The group has proposed a park a mile long and 200 feet wide. It
would lie on the first ridge _ a ``hogback'' _ west of Lakewood,
Colo., a Denver suburb. If the proposal is approved, Colorado
Highway 26 would be closed from Rooney Road to Colorado 93.
   Joe Tempel, environmental manager for the state highway
department, described the proposed Dinosaur Ridge Park as an
outdoor education laboratory, a ``hands-on science, ecology,
natural history park.''
   The most extensive collection of Morrison dinosaur fossils are
housed in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   ``The Morrison gives us the best picture of the really big
dinosaurs that lived in the age of dinosaurs,'' says David Burman,
curator of vertebrae fossils at the Carnegie. ``Because of the
nature of the environment it represented it has preserved more and
better specimens of any formation in any period.''
   Scientists credit the Rocky Mountains with allowing them to
study the dinosaur fossils. As the earth's crust rose and
contorted, erosion exposed layers of sandstone, limestone and
shale. The layers display the fossilized bones, footprints and
environment of the Jurassic Period.
   The Jurassic, a time from 205 million years to 130 million years
ago, is considered the second geological period in the age of
dinosaurs. The Morrison Formation appeared in the Upper Jurassic
period, 140 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were at their
largest.
   The Morrison Formation is ``part of one of the most complete
records of the history of life you can find,'' says Dr. Richard
Stucky, paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Natural History.
``There are episodes missing in the Rocky Mountains, but we do have
a fairly complete record.''
   In 1877, the dinosaur graveyard was discovered by visiting
scientists who found an apatosaurus and a stegosaurus near
Morrison. That find was quickly followed by the discovery of an
allosaurus and a camarasaurus north of Canon City, and dozens of
dinosaurs north of Laramie, Wyo. Those discoveries kicked off a
kind of ``fossil gold rush'' that continues today.
   There are dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era. Among them
are movements of the Earth, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes
in the climate, meteorites and even extraterrestrial hunters.
   Bakker believes dinosaurs became extinct because of worldwide
diseases that turned into an ``eptimological nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he says.
   Big animals travel and are very vulnerable to disease, Bakker
says. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the animals
would move, spreading all the hundreds of diseases throughout all
the herds on all continents _ eventually killing the lot.
   Most of the Carnegie collection of fossils came from what is now
Dinosaur National Monument, on the northwestern Colorado-Utah
border in Moffat County, Colo. Scientists took 750,000 pounds of
crated dinosaurs from the quarries.
   The expedition brought ``the best apatosaurus, a top-notch
diplodocus, a teen-age camarasaurus and the most complete
sauropod,'' Burman says.
   The first dinosaur at the museum was the diplodocus, found at
Sheep Creek, Wyo., which Burman says is one of the most famous in
the world. Plaster casts have been made and shipped to Germany,
France, Argentina, Spain and Portugal.
   ``One of the first plaster casts was shipped to the British
Museum at a time when these big fossils were relatively new, so
they created quite a stir in Europe,'' Burman says. ``Newspapers
carried headlines that read `Dippy Comes to England.'''
   The original diplodocus is still in the Carnegie Museum. But
Pittsburgh is not the only place to see such giants.
   ``In terms of seeing big dinosaurs before your eyes, you won't
see anything like the Morrison Formation in the world,'' Burman
says. ``It gives people a look at how the dinosaurs occur in the
rock.''

officials on a project to protect a famous Morrison Formation
outcropping southwest of Denver.
   The group has proposed a park a mile long and 200 feet wide. It
would lie on the first ridge _ a ``hogback'' _ west of Lakewood,
Colo., a Denver suburb. If the proposal is approved, Colorado 26
would be closed from Rooney Road to Colorado 93.
   Joe Tempel, environmental manager for the state highway
department, described the proposed Dinosaur Ridge Park as an
outdoor education laboratory, a ``hands-on science, ecology,
natural history park.''
   The most extensive collection of Morrison dinosaur fossils are
housed in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   ``The Morrison gives us the best picture of the really big
dinosaurs that lived in the age of dinosaurs,'' says David Burman,
curator of vertebrae fossils at the Carnegie. ``Because of the
nature of the environment it represented it has preserved more and
better specimens of any formation in any period.''
   Scientists credit the Rocky Mountains with allowing them to
study the dinosaur fossils. As the earth's crust rose and
contorted, erosion exposed layers of sandstone, limestone and
shale. The layers display the fossilized bones, footprints and
environment of the Jurassic Period.
   The Jurassic, a time from 205 million years to 130 million years
ago, is considered the second geological period in the age of
dinosaurs. The Morrison Formation appeared in the Upper Jurassic
period, 140 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were the largest
they ever got.
   The Morrison Formation is ``part of one of the most complete
records of the history of life you can find,'' says Dr. Richard
Stucky, paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Natural History.
``There are episodes missing in the Rocky Mountains, but we do have
a fairly complete record.''
   In 1877, the dinosaur graveyard was discovered by visiting
scientists who found an apatosaurus and a stegosaurus near
Morrison. That find was quickly followed by the discovery of an
allosaurus and a camarasaurus north of Canon City, and dozens of
dinosaurs north of Laramie, Wyo. Those discoveries kicked off a
kind of ``fossil gold rush'' that continues today.
   There are dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era. Among them
are movements of the Earth, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes
in the climate, meteorites and even extraterrestrial hunters.
   Bakker believes dinosaurs became extinct because of worldwide
diseases that turned into an ``epidemiological nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he says.
   Big animals travel and are very vulnerable to disease, Bakker
says. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the animals
would move, spreading all the hundreds of diseases throughout all
the herds on all continents _ eventually killing the lot.
   Most of the Carnegie collection of fossils came from what is now
Dinosaur National Monument, on the northwestern Colorado-Utah
border in Moffat County, Colo. Scientists took 750,000 pounds of
crated dinosaurs from the quarries.
   The expedition brought ``the best apatosaurus, a top-notch
diplodocus, a teen-age camarasaurus and the most complete
sauropod,'' Burman says.
   The first dinosaur at the museum was the diplodocus, found at
Sheep Creek, Wyo., which Burman says is one of the most famous in
the world. Plaster casts have been made and shipped to Germany,
France, Argentina, Spain and Portugal.
   ``One of the first plaster casts was shipped to the British
Museum at a time when these big fossils were relatively new, so
they created quite a stir in Europe,'' Burman says. ``Newspapers
carried headlines that read `Dippy Comes to England.'''
   The original diplodocus is still in the Carnegie Museum. But
Pittsburgh is not the only place to see such giants.
   ``In terms of seeing big dinosaurs before your eyes, you won't
see anything like the Morrison Formation in the world,'' Burman
says. ``It gives people a look at how the dinosaurs occur in the
rock.''

   The American Museum of Natural History has
decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to
dinosaurs.
   The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an
apatosaurus _ commonly known as a brontosaurus _ looked like.
   But because the museum's 17-foot-tall, 66-foot-long apatosaurus
skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140
million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.
   So the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads. One
is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton, another is a
model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the
apatosaurus' real head, and the third is the head of a close
relative of the extinct beast.
   ``We may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton
with a skull attached, but we think this is the most likely guess
based on the available evidence until we actually find a complete
skeleton with a skull attached,'' said Lowell Dingus, exhibit
coordinator.
   No one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull
attached. The skull created for the 1905 model skeleton was based on
that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin, a camarasaurus.
   Since then, paleontologists have changed their minds about the
apatosaurus' likely relatives. A paper published in 1978 argued that
the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus, implying the
apatosaurus had a longer, sleeker head than had been believed.
   When the museum tried to behead its apatosaurus in preparation
for a new skull, ``it sent vibrations down the skeleton and a couple
of the ribs fell off and broke,'' Dingus said.

   A 7-year-old who can't get enough baseball
figured a way to get neighborhood kids to come out to his local
sandlot. He bribed them with soda pop.
   ``I like baseball a lot,'' Billy Green said Tuesday. ``I played
little league for Bartonville `Little Dream Hut' this summer. But
the season's over now. I didn't have anyone to play with.''
   He tried to interest some ``big kids'' in a game, but they turned
him down because they considered him too small.
   Not to be deterred in his quest for one last game before he
enters third grade Aug. 24, Billy decided to up his offer.
   With the help of his 10-year-old sister, Angie, Billy passed out
hand-lettered fliers: ``Baseball Game, Held By Billy Green at
Pleasant Vallay School, Friday, Aug. 11, 1989. 3:00.''
   The key to the flier was the fine print at the bottom: ``Water
and cups supplied. Also Coke, 7-Up and Root Beer. Bring your bats,
gloves and balls!''
   Billy stuck fliers under doors in the neighborhood, and got more
than a dozen boys and girls ages 7 to 14 to turn out.
   ``Some of the big kids are kind of lazy,'' Angie said. ``You kind
of need a bribe to get them to play.''
   The game had a story-book ending as well. Billy doubled and his
team won, 5-1.

   Southfork Ranch can claim a real Ewing now.
   Cheryl Lee McClanahan gave birth to the first baby born at the

10-pound baby boy: Tory Lee Ewing Crick.
   ``We couldn't fit in J.R.,'' Ms. McClanahan said.
   The Dallas woman was a week away from her expected delivery date,
but she decided to accompany her fiance, Chase Crick, to the ranch
just east of Parker. Crick had won a two-day stay at the ranch,
where exterior scenes for the ``Dallas'' television series are shot.
   When she realized she was about to give birth, she called a
midwife who helped her deliver the child.

   Concord (N.H.) Monitor on IRAs' tax advantage:
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's presidential aspirations could mean
tax breaks for millions of Americans.
   Bentsen's plan restores part of the IRA's tax advantage. It
would allow anyone to put up to $2,000 per year in an IRA while
paying taxes on half that amount. Taxes would have to be paid on
withdrawals from IRAs to pay for a first home or college expenses,
but no penalty for early withdrawal would be incurred.
   For financial reasons alone, Bentsen's expansion of IRAs is far
preferable to (President) Bush's cut in the capital gains tax.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on chemical weapons:
   President Bush received a ringing ovation by representatives of
the nations around the world when he called chemical weapons a
``scourge'' of the Earth.
   The proposal he unveiled before the United Nations General
Assembly to destroy more than 80 percent of the United States'
stockpile of those weapons if the Soviets reduce arsenals to an
equal level is praiseworthy. But it's not as sterling an ambition
as his wish to have international treaties ban the weapons entirely.
   The president's proposed ban makes sense.
   Militarily, the use of deadly chemicals is a repugnant
alternative. Unlike other weapons, lethal gases cannot be carefully
targeted. They know no boundaries, save the wind. ...
   Sooner or later, chemical weapons could find their way into the
hands of terrorists.
   The president said more than 20 nations have chemical weapons or
the capability to produce them.
   ``For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this
threat,'' the president said.
   We couldn't agree more.

   Los Angeles Times on the Gorbachev revolution:
   The Soviet Union may be heading for a second October Revolution,
this one little more than a year from now when a Communist Party
Congress convenes ahead of schedule for the purpose of packing the
important Central Committee with people who are more in step with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist plans.
   Moving up the date of the next congress by some months was
approved at (last) week's Central Committee meeting. Also approved
was a shakeup in the party's ruling Politburo that should work to
further consolidate Gorbachev's power.
   Steadily and surely, the opponents of change, along with inept
and unpopular regional leaders, are being pensioned off in favor of
Gorbachev loyalists. The October, 1990 party congress is expected
to advance or even complete the consolidation process by providing
Gorbachev with the instrument he needs under party rules to fill
vacancies on the Central Committee with his supporters.
   For all the talk of powerful opposition to his (economic and
political) reform efforts and even widely reported rumors of plots
to oust him from office, Gorbachev thus seems to have emerged
stronger and more in charge than ever before. ...
   The downside could be that in reshaping the party and government
leadership in his own image, Gorbachev will lose what until now had
been a built-in excuse for not making more effective progress more
quickly.

   The Daily Journal, Vineland, N.J., on the Federal Election
Commission:
   It should come as no surprise that the Federal Election
Commission, set up in 1974 to enforce federal campaign laws,
apparently has not been doing its job.
   (A Common Cause study) said that the commission has sanctioned
campaign activities that run counter to central provisions of the
post-Watergate reform laws, including the state's campaign
contribution and expenditure limit.
   The six-member commission has on a number of occasions even
rejected the advice of its attorneys, who have argued for
enforcement of the law.
   The commission's real flaw is the people who sit on it. And
given the widespread inattention to ethics throughout government
these days, we're not sure how that one will be solved _ except by
throwing the blackguards out.

brontosaurus is apatosaurus. ...

   Our office ... dictionary ... carries nothing under apatosaurus,
but under brontosaurus features a drawing of the beast and a
definition.
   If (scientists) want the world to get these names straight,
perhaps they should start with the dictionary publishers. ...

controversy accompanying their issue will produce more instant
knowledge about this question of nomenclature _ among both children

   COMO BLUFF, WYO. -- According to Robert Bakker, much of
what you think you know about dinosaurs is wrong. And he has
devoted his life to setting it right.
   Dinosaurs, insists the 46-year-old paleontologist and
museum curator at the University of Colorado, weren't
coldblooded, lizard-like behemoths that lumbered across the
land and wallowed in swamps. Contrary to popular belief, many
were warm-blooded creatures with colorful skins, and they ran
like cheetahs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If that isn't radical enough for you, consider Mr.
Bakker's reason for crawling around on a wind-swept, treeless
bluff here in the high plains of southern Wyoming: He is
searching for clues to disprove one of science's most
currently popular theories -- that dinosaurs were wiped out
en masse after an asteroid fell, suddenly changing the
earth's climate for the colder.
   Mr. Bakker's theory? They were done in because they liked
to travel too much.
   It's just another day at the office for the enfant
terrible of paleontology, whose whole life seems bent on
irking the scientific establishment. Most scientists speak
cautiously, in terms like "the evidence suggests." The brash
Mr. Bakker proclaims his theories with an air of certainty.
Other archaeological expeditions are larded with Ph.D.s and
graduate students from prestigious institutions; Mr. Bakker
mans his with amateurs he refers to as "Mesozoic
bird-watchers." (Mr. Bakker, himself, is equipped with all
the usual, impressive credentials, including a Harvard
doctorate.) While most paleontologists ship their discoveries
to far-off Eastern universities for study and storage, Mr.
Bakker helps local towns build museums to house fossils found
close at hand.
   But though some of his peers dismiss his theories -- and
many abhor his style -- few deny that he is roiling the
prehistoric waters. Mr. Bakker's theories are discussed in
college classes, in textbooks and encyclopedias as
alternative views of Mesozoic life. "Before Bakker came
along, dinosaurs looked like extinct old bones," says Sankar
Chatterjee of Texas Tech University. "With Bakker, dinosaurs
became vibrant, living beings." Well, in a manner of
speaking.
   How he accomplished that is a sore subject in the science
-- so sore, in fact, that some of his peers won't talk about
him. Others complain that he is a showboat, promoting his
notions in the popular press and on TV, not just before they
have been accepted by the paleontology establishment, but, in
some cases, even before they have been published in a
scientific journal.
   Mr. Bakker is clearly annoyed by the criticism. "If I seem
aggressive," he says, "it's because sometimes one gets
impatient with orthodoxy."
   But Mr. Bakker doesn't spend all his time romancing the
media. Mostly, he spends it trying to prove his extinction
theory, which means long hours painstakingly combing the dirt
here on Como Bluff for bones.
   On a current dig, the paleontologist is pushing dirt
around a gray mound with his fingers as his long, kinky hair
drags in the dust and his jeans get dirtier. A few hundred
yards away, James Siegwarth, a physicist with the
government's National Institute of Standards and Technology,
is digging out the vertebra of a huge allosaur, a two-ton
meat-eater of the Jurassic era, after two days of carefully
prodding the dirt with tiny ice picks and paintbrushes. His
work isn't over: It can take up to 200 hours in the lab just
to clean the big bone. "I don't mind," he says. "I guess I
like playing in the dirt."
   In the summer of 1990, Mr. Siegwarth and another dinosaur
buff, Jim Filla, spotted some tiny bones sticking out of the
mudstone here. And, though at least one paleontologist they
approached wasn't interested, when they took the bones to Mr.
Bakker, he promptly declared the find a new species of
dinosaur, named it Drinker (after the early paleontologist
Edward Drinker Cope), and recruited Messrs. Siegwarth and
Filla for a new dig at Como, which had been considered a
played-out site. Since then, the "Como Irregulars," as Mr.
Bakker calls them, have unearthed more than half a dozen
heretofore-undiscovered dinosaurs, with, he hopes, more to
come. "I want to find a voracious, small-minded predator and
name it after the IRS," Mr. Bakker says.
   Mr. Bakker wishes more amateurs would join the hunt. "We
need 10 times, 100 times more weekenders," he says. "The
reason the world knows so much about birds is because there
are thousands of amateur bird-watchers. The reason we know so
little about dinosaurs is there are too few people looking
for them."
   He blames the shortage on pretentious paleontologists who
insist on calling an eye socket "the fossa orbital" and who
generally look down at enthusiastic amateurs. "My science is
low-tech, and it requires sharp eyes and delicate fingers,"
not a knowledge of Latin, says Mr. Bakker. "Ph.D.s are a dead
loss," he adds. "They break things."
   With his weekenders, Mr. Bakker hopes to prove that
dinosaurs didn't die from an asteroid collision. Supporters
of the much-in-vogue asteroid theory argue that a layer of
iridium separating rocks of the Cretaceous and Tertiary
periods was left by an asteroid whose impact created a
nuclear winter-like climatic disaster. That wiped out many
species, including the dinosaurs, says physicist Walter
Alvarez, whose theory this is. His argument: Dinosaurs are
found in rocks laid down before the iridium was deposited,
but not afterward.
   But that doesn't make sense to Mr. Bakker, who contends
that bones would have been found on top of the iridium if the
dinosaurs died after the asteroid collision. And why did the
small and delicate frogs and toads survive the cold and
drought while bigger beasts didn't? Frogs should have bit the
dust first, he says.
   Mr. Bakker's theory is based on the ebb and flow of early
seas. Paleontologists have documented several dinosaur
extinctions in the Mesozoic Era that coincide with periods of
shrinking seas. When the seas ebbed between the Jurassic and
Cretaceous periods, for example, most dinosaurs, including
the brontosaurs, were wiped out. Mr. Bakker calls that
extinction the "dinosaur midlife crisis."
   Mr. Bakker points out that each time the seas receded,
land bridges appeared. Over those bridges, the largest and
most mobile dinosaurs wandered into new territory searching
for food. They also found exotic and deadly new diseases, Mr.
Bakker argues. Itinerant dinosaurs carried new diseases to
alien lands, causing epidemics.
   The bones of the Drinker dinosaur in the rocks at Como
Bluff helped him form this theory. The Drinker apparently was
one of the few species to survive the Jurassic. "The old
money crowd, the brontosaurs, are damn rare here," says Mr.
Bakker, waving his arm over the layer where Drinker bones
have been found. Drinker survived, he believes, because it
was small -- about the size of a turkey -- and thus couldn't
wander far. Neither could frogs and toads.
   In an effort to win skeptical colleagues over to his
notions, Mr. Bakker plans a blitz of papers, which he
illustrates himself. But no matter how his extinction theory
is received, he plans to continue his quest to alter the
world's vision of the prehistoric world. Dinosaur orthodoxy,
he says, was "100% wrong when I was growing up. Now it's only
half wrong."

<P>
JURASSIC PARK BY MICHAEL CRICHTON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 413 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Ferguson, Ferguson is an editorial writer with Scripps Howard News 
Service.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Crichton, the doctor (Harvard Medical) turned novelist ("The Andromeda 
Strain") turned moviemaker ("Coma"), is a worry wart, and like most excessively 
anxious people he feels duty-bound to make the rest of us as edgy as he is. His 
many novels and movies form an extended brief explaining why we, as a nation, 
race and planet, should have a serious case of the willies. 
</P>
<P>
The theme that preoccupies him is nothing less than the hubris of man and the 
heedlessness of science. Our capacity for technological innovation, in his 
view, has outstripped our capacity to deal maturely with the power it affords, 
carrying us inexorably to the yawning abyss of annihilation. Crichton's first 
novel, "The Andromeda Strain," told the story of a 
life-as-we-know-it-destroying bacterium uncorked by money-grubbing scientists; 
likewise, his movie "Westworld" featured a rampaging amusement-park automaton 
(played by Yul Brynner) who turns on his feckless human creators and, Yul 
Brynner-like, pumps them full of hot lead. 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether Crichton's worries about rampaging bacilli and 
deranged automatons are justified -- even now, after all, an irritable Third 
World dictator is hoarding untold stashes of bacteria, and you never can tell 
when the talking Abraham Lincoln at Disneyland might go berserk during some 
matinee, lifting skirts and making rude noises with his armpits. But so far the 
Crichton prognostication average has not been good -- zero, in fact. We should 
hope it stays that way. Otherwise, having read Crichton's fat new novel, 
"Jurassic Park," I have a word of advice for anyone owning real estate within 
10 miles of La Brea tar pits: Sell. 
</P>
<P>
What sets Crichton's teeth to chattering these days is biotechnology, the 
manipulation of DNA to create new forms of life or -- the premise of "Jurassic 
Park" -- re-create old ones. The novel opens with a documentary-like sketch of 
how this new technology has come to be corrupted by slithery commerce. Once 
scientists were pure, disinterested; now they -- unlike, say, the directors of 
sci-fi movies and the authors of pulp fiction -- have lowered themselves to 
making a buck. "Suddenly," Mr. Crichton writes, "it seemed as if everyone 
wanted to become rich." 
</P>
<P>
"Jurassic Park" is the story of how this ignoble ambition, married to 
biotechnology, results in the beginning of the end of the world as we know it, 
or at least of Costa Rica. That hapless Central American country is the site of 
the eponymous park, developed by one John Hammond, a money-grubbing and devious 
American entrepreneur, on an island off the coast. There money-grubbing 
scientists, working in secret, have managed to cull dinosaur DNA from ancient 
amber and re-construct living versions of the beasts, so that they might serve 
as tourist attractions for wonder-struck Americanos. 
</P>
<P>
Things, as you can imagine, quickly go awry. A few months before the park is to 
open, an unspecified number of the smaller dinosaurs escape to the mainland, 
where, on a deserted beach, they maul the vacationing family of a Dallas 
real-estate developer -- a tragedy all the more horrifying because the 
real-estate developer escapes unharmed. The authorities remain unaware of the 
danger through a series of amazingly convenient botches, giving Hammond the 
chance to summon a handful of experts to set matters in order. 
</P>
<P>
This is a risky plot device for Mr. Crichton, since it requires him to 
introduce characters into his elaborate fictional architecture, and the 
creation of plausible characters is not, to speak generously, his strength. Our 
hero is a paleontologist called Grant; we are signalled his hero status early 
on when Mr. Crichton informs us that Grant eschews the stuffy tweeds of the 
common prof in favor of jeans and sneakers -- even when he lectures! He is 
joined on the island by a mathematician named Malcolm; a sexy assistant called 
Sattler; a candy-bar-scarfing computer jockey, Nedry by name, who designed the 
island's labyrinthine security systems, and two insufferably precocious 
grandchildren of the evil Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
The mutilations begin in earnest not long after this group arrives at Jurassic 
Park. The computer expert (note that a single letter's transposition makes 
Nedry nerdy -- a typical Crichton subtlety) neutralizes the island's electronic 
fences for his own devious purposes, mostly of the money-grubbing kind. His 
comeuppance follows shortly after, for with the fences down the dinosaurs roam 
freely, and before long they've put on the old feed bag and are dining on 
Nedry's innards. Hungry creatures, dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
Nedry's intestines are neither the first nor the last to be spilled and gnawed 
in Jurassic Park. In these scenes, Crichton's prose, usually rough-hewn and 
business-like, takes on an almost sensual vividness. "Nedry stumbled, reaching 
blindly down to touch the ragged edge of his shirt, and then a thick, slippery 
mass that was surprisingly warm, and with horror he suddenly knew . . . his 
guts had fallen out." The vividness increases when you remember that Nedry has 
spent the afternoon eating Mars Bars. 
</P>
<P>
As unattractive as these passages are, they're almost Johnsonian compared with 
the dithering of the mathematician Malcolm, who serves as Crichton's Greek 
chorus. Hubris-of-man and heedlessness-of-science soliloquys flow from him like 
intestines from a computer nerd. Our "Western training" saps our appreciation 
of nature, Crichton-Malcolm announces ponderously, and encourages us to conquer 
nature rather than live harmoniously with it -- a tired if once again 
fashionable idea that has been far more cogently expressed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
My pre-publication copy of "Jurassic Park" bears the ominous phrase "Soon to be 
a major motion picture," raising the suspicion that this fat novel is really a 
screenplay larded up with a few tons of exposition. A movie would have the 
advantage of being without Malcolm's dime-store philosophizing, but it would 
lack too the book's only real virtue: its genuinely interesting discussions of 
dinosaurs, DNA research, paleontology and chaos theory. 
</P>
<P>
Crichton could have performed a service by using this material to write books 
of popular science. Instead, he's written a ponderous novel soon to be a major, 
and undoubtedly trashy, motion picture. Suddenly it seems as if everybody wants 
to become rich.

   The skull of a prehistoric animal has been identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact, meat-eating dinosaur, scientists announced Thursday. 

   The skull was misidentified after its discovery in 1942 in eastern Montana by an expedition from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, officials said. 
It was in storage in the museum's basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year. 

   The museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of the ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago. 
Because of its relatively small size, the new dinosaur has been named Nanotyrannus or "pygmy tyrant" by the identifying scientists. 

   Robert T. Bakker, adjunct curator of paleontology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, grew suspicious of the skull's initial identification as a Gorgosaurus, a primitive and very common meat-eater, during a visit to the Cleveland museum last spring. 
He worked with two other scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was reported this month in a paleontology publication. 

   The Nanotyrannus resembled the giant Tyrannosaurus rex but was only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy, the scientists said. 

   Mr. Bakker blamed the 40-year misidentification on a lack of scientists. 

   "There are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs, or crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter you're talking about," he said.

   The skull of a prehistoric animal has been
identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact,
meat-eating dinosaur, scientists announced Thursday.
   The skull was misidentified after its discovery in 1942 in
eastern Montana by an expedition from the Cleveland Museum of
Natural History, officials said. It was in storage in the museum's
basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year.
   The museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of
the Tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs, a ferocious meat-eating
animal that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago.
   Because of its relatively small size, the new dinosaur has been
named Nanotyrannus or ``pygmy tyrant'' by the scientists who
identified it. The Cleveland skull is believed to be the only such
specimen of the Nanotyrannus, although teeth have been found in
Montana and South Dakota.
   ``This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said Robert
T. Bakker, adjunct curator of paleontology at the University of
Colorado in Boulder.
   Bakker grew suspicious of the skull's initial identification as
a Gorgosaurus, a primitive and very common meat-eater, during a
visit to the Cleveland museum last spring. He worked with two other
scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was
disclosed in a paleontology publication this month.
   The Nanotyrannus resembled the giant Tyrannosaurus rex but was
only about one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy, the
scientists said. Bakker said the Nanotyrannus probably weighed less
than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail.
   Bakker compared the skull, which is about 22 inches long and 10
inches high, to the size of a brown bear's head.
   He said the Nanotyrannus had the same level of advancement in
anatomical features as the Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets
that faced forward instead of sideways, a wider skull base and a
neck joint that bent downwards.
   The Nanotyrannus head was discovered during a museum field trip
to a farm in Carter County, Montana. The expedition yielded other
dinosaur skeletons in the museum's collection but no other parts of
the Nanotyrannus.
   ``It's very rare to find just the head, very rare. And I hope
the rest of it is out there,'' Bakker said after a news conference
to announce the discovery.
   Michael E. Williams, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
museum, said there are no plans to excavate the site again.
   Bakker blamed the 40-year misidentification on a lack of
scientists.
   ``There are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs, or
crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter you're talking
about,'' he said.
   The third scientist involved in the discovery with Bakker and
Williams was Philip Currie, assistant direector of the Tyrrell
Museum of Paleontology in Alberta, Canada.

   The discovery of the fossilized bones of a giant
meat-eating dinosaur predating the fearsome tyrannosaurus rex
strengthens the theory that dinosaurs evolved rapidly before
becoming extinct, a scientist said Thursday.
   The bones of an Epanterias were found at the top of the Morrison
Formation deposit, an ancient saline lakebed near Fort Collins, by
a paleontology team from the University of Colorado Museum in
Boulder.
   The discovery a year and a half ago was only the third of an
Epanterias, according to Robert Bakker, a research associate at the
museum, who announced the find Wednesday.
   Bakker identified the giant member of the allosaur family from a
jawbone and parts of the neck and tail vertebrate.
   Bakker said the discover strengthens the theory that dinosaurs
entombed in the Morrison Formation, which dates to 130 million
years ago, and elsewhere in North America evolved rapidly.
   ``On average, the rule is that big animals tend to get bigger
until they go extinct. The incredible size of Epanterias indicates
there was some sort of an evolutionary arms race going on,'' Bakker
said in a telephone interview from Boulder.
   The Epanterias, which weighed about four tons and was 50 feet
long, could have eaten about 40 tons of meat annually, and its
ability to expand its enormous jaws _ much like modern-day snakes _
would have allowed Epanterias to gulp huge bites of prey easily.
   The Morrison Formation, about 50 miles north of Denver, contains
up to six distinct dinosaur fauna from successive time periods,
Bakker said.
   The formation is only about 300 feet deep, he said, ``but every
50 feet or so you have a different species. This one was only in
the last 20 feet and the earlier ones also were short-lived. Things
were really moving at that time.''
   The other two discoveries of Epanterias fossils were in 1877
near Canon City, 80 miles south of Denver, and in 1934 in the
Oklahoma panhandle.
   Epanterias apparently was the last and largest species in the
evolutionary line of allosaurs, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked
on their hind legs, Bakker said.
   Epanterias' great size confused early paleontologists, he said.
The bones of the Canon City specimen were so large they were
initially misidentified as brontosaur bones.
   Bakker speculated the size increase of many dinosaur species
over time may have been due to sexual selection, predation success
or disease resistance.
   He subscribes to the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded
like modern birds and that dinosaur mass extinctions about 66
million years ago may have been brought on by extensive migrations
and outbreaks of disease.
   Bakker said he and other researchers will study all three
Epanterias specimens and they hope to assemble a complete model
pieced together from portions of each dinosaur.

<TEXT>
   About 30 fossilized dinosaur teeth
found near Tucumcari are estimated to be 220 million years old,
meaning the creature was one of the first of its kind to inhabit
the earth.
   ``This is of worldwide importance because it is so rare,'' said
Adrian Hunt, a doctoral candidate at the University of New Mexico.
   Hunt, who made the discoveries during four years of explorations
for the New Mexico Museum of Natural History, said Thursday the
shape of the animal's teeth indicate it was one of the first
dinosaurs on earth.
   He named the animal Revueltosaurus callenderi, after the New
Mexico museum's director, Jon Callender. The first part of the name
referred to a Spanish word for revolution, `revuelta.'
   The discoveries are discussed in a book published this week
titled ``Dawn of the Age of Dinosaurs in the American Southwest,''
edited by Hunt and museum paleontologist Spencer Lucas.
   Lucas said it was the first new genus of dinosaur discovered in
New Mexico since 1923 and the first new dinosaur species found in
the state in nearly 30 years. ``We're breaking a lot of new ground
after a long dry spell,'' he said.
   Found with the teeth were fossils of many early ancestors to
mammals, turtles, crocodiles, flying reptiles and birds, several of
which have yet to be identified, Hunt said.
   Tucumcari is in eastern New Mexico about 30 miles from the Texas
border.
   ``The area is an incredible graveyard of ancient animals,''
Lucas said.
   The authors' conclusions have yet to be reviewed by scientific
peers.
   Their theory is that Revueltosaurus was the ancestor of all the
plant-eating dinosaurs, including stegosaurus. It resembles a
10-foot-long lizard with 3-foot hind legs that permitted it to walk
nearly upright. It had much smaller forelegs.
   The oldest previous North America fossil, also dating back some
220 million years, was unearthed several years ago in west Texas.
   Dinosaur fossils from the same period have been found in Africa
and the Mediterranean.

Scientists have found fossil remains of a previously unknown eight-foot lizard 
that may have attacked baby dinosaurs, a researcher reported last week. A 
well-preserved skull and a forelimb of the beast, about 80 million years old, 
were unearthed in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, said Michael Novacek, vice president 
and dean of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The creature apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon -- the largest living 
lizard, reaching lengths of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles, 
Novacek said. The present-day animal has been known to attack and consume human 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient lizard, perhaps a juvenile, may have eaten young dinosaurs or 
dinosaur eggs. Its bones were found near a dinosaur nesting site that contained 
eight eggs, Novacek said. The find occurred during an expedition Novacek called 
the first to Mongolia by Western paleontologists in 65 years.

   A misidentified dinosaur skull found in the
Cleveland Museum of Natural History's basement came from a
previously unknown meat-eating reptile that was a pygmy cousin of
Tyrannosaurus rex, scientists say.
   The skull was found on a southeast Montana farm 46 years ago by
a museum expedition, but was misidentified as a gorgosaur, a
relatively primitive, common carnivore, scientists said at a news
conference Thursday.
   The new genus has been named Nanotyrannus, or ``pygmy tyrant,''
by the three scientists who discovered it.
   ``This animal is so different from any other meat-eater that it
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree,'' said Robert
T. Bakker, adjunct curator of paleontology at the University of
Colorado in Boulder.
   Bakker said he found the skull, believed to be the only
Nanotyrannus specimen, while rummaging around the museum's basement
last spring.
   ``The best place in North America to find new (kinds) of
dinosaurs ...is to look in basements, he said. ``There are never
enough scientists to study specimens as soon as they come out of
the crate. This came out of the crate in 1942. But no one did a
detailed study.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the Earth some 60 million years ago.
Nanotyrannus resembled the bigger dinosaur, but was only about
one-third as large and one-tenth as heavy. It probably weighed less
than 1,000 pounds, stood about 10 feet tall, walked on its hind
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail, Bakker said.
   The skull, about 22 inches long and 10 inches high, is about the
size of a brown bear's head, Bakker said.
   Nanotyrannus had the same advanced anatomical features as
Tyrannosaurus rex, including eye sockets that faced forward instead
of sideways and a neck joint that bent downwards.
   The expedition that found the skull yielded other dinosaur
skeletons in the musuem's collection, but no other Nanotyrannus
parts.
   ``It's very rare to find a perfect head and no backbone or no
hind leg or tail or ribs,'' Bakker said. ``It's not impossible that
the body is still out there entombed in very hard sandstone.''
   There are no plans to excavate the site again, said Michael
Williams, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the musuem. The
third scientist involved in the discovery was Philip Currie,
assistant director of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in
Alberta, Canada.
   Williams said the skull had been on display, but not for at
least the last 10 years.
   Bakker said Tyrannosaurus rex is the most popular dinosaur among
children he gives talks to.
   ``I think Tyrannosaurus rex wil continue to be the favorite
dinosaur, but I bet you the pygmy tyrant becomes the second most
popular,'' he said.

   The first known remains of a giant lizard that
may have dined on baby dinosaurs have been found in Mongolia, a
researcher says.
   The 80-million-year-old skull and forelimb were a highlight of
the first expedition to that country by Western paleontologists in
65 years, said Michael Novacek.
   The lizard, which apparently resembled today's Komodo dragon,
was perhaps 8 feet long and may have been a juvenile, Novacek said.
It may have eaten young dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs, he said.
   Its fossil remains were found in the Gobi Desert, near a
dinosaur nesting site that contained eight eggs, he said.
   The Komodo dragon is the largest living lizard, reaching a
length of more than 11 feet in Southeast Asian jungles. Novacek
said the animal has been known to attack and consume adult humans.
   Novacek is vice president and dean of science at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York. He and museum colleagues
Malcolm McKenna and Mark Norell recently undertook the month-long
expedition at the invitation of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences.
   The American researchers and Mongolian counterparts also found
100-million-year-old remains of shrew-sized mammals, which may shed
light on the spread of the ancestors of modern mammals, he said.
   They also found two unusually well-preserved skeletons of
protoceratops, a beaked dinosaur that grew 4 to 5 feet long, and
one of an armored dinosaur called an ankylosaur, which grew 15 to
20 feet long, Novacek said. The fossils were about 80 million years
old.
   The wealth of discoveries from the relatively brief expedition
gives hope that further work will turn up much more material, he
said. The museum and the Mongolian academy signed an agreement for
three more expeditions over the next three years, he said.
   Mongolia contains ``a tremendous potential for exploration that
you don't see in North America,'' with areas the size of Wyoming
that have not been explored, he said.

   Denny's Inc. plans to start serving Brontosaurus burgers. 

   The new dish is part of a $10 million year-long promotion by the restaurant chain using the Flintstones, a prehistoric cartoon family, to appeal to children. 
Denny's said it plans a new children's menu, activity books featuring the Flintstones and a birthday club. 

   The promotion, which starts today, includes television, radio and print advertising. 

   Tom Mourkas, Denny's vice president for operations, said the chain opted for a Flintstones promotion because children "have a significant influence in a family's purchasing decisions." 

   Mr. Mourkas said an eight-month test of the promotion in Fresno, Calif., and Buffalo, N.Y., was "very successful" and resulted in a 6% increase in the number of restaurant patrons.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kelley Roberts, a 21-year-old Downey resident, spent a recent afternoon working 
on a small papier-mache dinosaur that will slide along the tail of its towering 
mother on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kelsey, 21, spoke about piloting a float down the streets of Pasadena 
his first time as a driver. "This thing's a pain in the butt to parallel park," 
the Bellflower resident joked. 
</P>
<P>
The young men are among scores of volunteers who work each year to bring Downey 
to the world's attention for a fleeting moment, when network television cameras 
focus on the community's float during the Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
This year's entry, called "Fun 'n' Play in Ol' L.A.," features dinosaurs that 
roamed millions of years ago near what is now Wilshire Boulevard and La Brea 
Avenue in Los Angeles. The mother brontosaurus will lift and move her head and 
tail, and a baby dinosaur will slide up and down the tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people worldwide at least once a year know Downey is on the map," 
said longtime volunteer Doris Patterson, spokeswoman for the nonprofit Downey 
Rose Float Assn. "It's prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a city tradition. The first float was entered in 1920, long before 
Downey became a city. The next entry didn't come until 1955, the year before 
Downey incorporated. Patterson figures that city founders, in part, resurrected 
the float project to help whip up support for cityhood. There has been a Downey 
float in the Rose Parade ever since. 
</P>
<P>
City workers used to build the frame of the float, and association volunteers 
handled the decorating, said Cel Kimberly, who has helped build the floats for 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But after the passage of the tax-slashing Proposition 13 in 1978, city 
officials decided they couldn't afford to pay workers to build floats. The 
Downey Rose Float Assn. picked up the slack by raising more money and 
recruiting more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey float is now a member of a nearly extinct species. In a parade of 
corporate floats that cost as much as $200,000, the Downey entry is one of just 
six floats that are built entirely by volunteers, a Rose Parade official said. 
"It's a tradition that the tournament likes to hang on to," said Rose Parade 
spokeswoman Kristin Tranquada. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is the only other city in the Southeast area that will have a float 
in the parade. But the city pays for the float, which is professionally built. 
The city will spend $95,000 on the float this year, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Downey float rambles down Pasadena's Colorado Boulevard, more 
than 200 volunteers will have pitched in, from welding the metal skeleton and 
installing the hydraulic lifts to affixing thousands of roses, mums, 
carnations, orchids and other flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The association chooses a float design through an annual contest. This year, 
there were about 50 entries suggesting characters ranging from bears to alley 
cats, Patterson said. The chief builder is Roy Long, a longtime Downey resident 
and steam fitter at the county's Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center. The rest of 
the volunteers are adults and students from Downey and surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
Long says he has been putting in 15 to 20 hours a week since last May -- "to 
give something back to the community. It's just a labor of love." Roberts and 
Kelsey say they volunteered because it's just plain fun -- and they might meet 
a pretty girl or two amid the roses. 
</P>
<P>
The materials for the float cost the association about $50,000, which was 
raised through numerous community fund-raisers during the past year. The city 
of Downey provided a $1,000 grant to the float association. 
</P>
<P>
Association members prefer to raise money for materials and build the float 
themselves, rather than having the city or a corporate sponsor foot the bill or 
do most of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"Pride is taken away when things are done for you," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers also have countless memories, some of harried and poignant 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
A welder's torch sparked a fire that devoured the grass mane of a unicorn on 
the 1984 entry. The fire broke out on the eve of the parade, after the flower 
markets had closed, Kimberly recalled. Association members scoured planted 
areas along local freeways and gathered the pampas grass they needed to replace 
the mane. 
</P>
<P>
"Some police officers came by and asked what they were doing," Kimberly said. 
"When they found out it was for the float, they said 'Go ahead.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the 1987 entry, which featured an animated replica of the space 
shuttle. It was a natural because the shuttle is the most famous product to 
come out of Downey. Rockwell International, the shuttle's primary builder, has 
operated a plant in Downey for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials settled on the float design in late January, 1986. A few 
days later, on Jan. 28, the space shuttle Challenger exploded, killing seven 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Parade officials questioned whether the entry should be dropped, said 
Kimberly, who was the association's president at the time. "It was a strange 
fluke," Kimberly said. "Our intention was not to play it up (the shuttle 
disaster) but to salute the space program." 
</P>
<P>
The float proceeded as planned and won the Founders' Trophy -- "Most beautiful 
entry built and decorated by volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Work on this year's float has moved along smoothly so far, Patterson said. 
Volunteers planned to begin applying the flowers Thursday at the warehouse. At 
about 6 p.m. on New Years Eve, the float will be towed along surface streets to 
Pasadena. A local motorcycle club will provide escort for the trip, which could 
take as long as five hours, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
And the association will start preparing for the next float in late January. 
</P>
<P>
But the volunteers face an additional challenge in 1991 -- finding a new home 
for their float. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the float has been stored in a warehouse at the county's 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center on Downey's western border. Association 
officials have been given notice that the warehouse will be demolished next 
summer to make way for a business park. 
</P>
<P>
So far, association officials have raised about $40,000 of the $200,000 they 
need to build a new hangar on city property. They are determined that the show 
must go on. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a way of life," Patterson said.

<HEAD>Tyrannosaurus Skeleton Emerging From Montana Badlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JORDAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest carnivore ever to roam the
Earth is emerging from the badlands of eastern Montana _ after
being buried for 65 million years.
   A museum crew's careful digging has uncovered most of an intact
skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex, only the eighth ever found. The
remains exposed so far include the skull, tail, pelvis area, arm
and back.
   The lower arm bones are the first ever found for any T-rex.
   The Tyrannosaurus is perhaps the most fabled of all dinosaurs
because of its size _ nearly 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet
high _ and its meat-eating diet.
   ``If you like ferocity ... ferocious things, the T-rex has got
to be at the top of the list,'' said Jack Horner of the Museum of
the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont. ``It has a whole mouth full of steak
knives, which it almost exclusively used to eat meat.''
   Tyrannosaurus rex teeth were up to 6 inches long. The skull
being unearthed is 4 feet long, with eye sockets 4 to 5 inches in
diameter. The socket hole in the pelvis where the leg attached is
10 inches across.
   Horner, head of paleontology at the museum, said the scientific
value of the T-rex skeleton is limited, but it will be a big
drawing card for the museum.
   ``It's a real showy thing,'' he said Monday. ``Then we'll show
them things they might not have driven so far to see, but I think
are better.''
   Horner is known internationally for his discoveries of dinosaur
fossils in the northern Plains and the Rocky Mountain foothills, as
well as his theories on dinosaur behavior.
   His work has shown that dinosaurs tended to care for their
young, more like birds than modern-day reptiles. Among the museum
displays is a dinosaur nest, with fossilized baby dinosaurs just
emerging from their fossilized eggs.
   Horner said the Tyrannosaurus rex will be studied and a
scientific description written.
   Nicholas Hotton, a curator of paleontology at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., said any new knowledge about the
giant carnivore would help.
   Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered early this century.
   ``It was described in a paper three pages long and that's all
there is. Nobody has ever described it in detail,'' Hotton said.
   The newly discovered skeleton still has all the vertebrae from
the back and tail fused together. The skull broke off at the neck,
but is only several feet away from the neck and back. Leg bones
have been found near the skull and more are thought to be buried
beneath the other bones.
   It will take a dozen people several more weeks to finish the
painstaking task of exposing the bones, which will then be put in
plaster casts and loaded on trucks to be hauled to the museum.

   Big Al Unearthed

   Greybull, Wyo. -- Big Al died 150 million years ago, but
his future was decided in a few days last fall. Discovered by
Swiss commercial collectors who thought they were working on
private land, he turned out to be the first complete dinosaur
found in Wyoming and, with at least 90% of him there, the
most complete allosaurus ever found. Like its larger, later
cousin Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis walked upright
and had short arms.
   Big Al's discovery caused an upheaval in more than rock.
It unearthed the fact that the U.S. has no laws protecting
paleontological finds from export. If the Swiss had indeed
been on private land, Big Al probably would have been taken
out of the country.

<TEXT>
   He is staying home by chance. A Bureau of Land Management
spotter on a routine fire-check flight noticed a primitive
road had been improved. BLM officials checked it out, found
the Swiss, consulted maps and sent out surveyors, who
determined that the dinosaur was on federal land.
   The Swiss ceased excavating while the BLM moved at what is
surely record speed for any federal agency, calling in a
group of experts to figure out what should happen next: Pat
Lieggi, chief preparator of paleontology at Montana's Museum
of the Rockies; Brent Breithaupt, curator of the University
of Wyoming's Geological Museum; and Brooks Britt, a
specialist in Jurassic carnivorous dinosaurs at Alberta's
Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology. (The Smithsonian, the
usual repository for fossils found on public land, was also
called, but it elected not to send a representative.)
   The consensus of those present was that the Museum of the
Rockies and the University of Wyoming should collaborate on
research and that Big Al should go to the Museum of the
Rockies in Bozeman, Mont., with casts going to the University
of Wyoming and the BLM. Mr. Lieggi called the project "a real
morale boost for everyone in paleo research. It's like a
payback to see something like this in the ground and get it
back home and work on it."
   Big Al was found in the Morrison Formation, representing
the late Jurassic period. The landscape is one of rounded
badland hills built of layers of color -- red, sand, orange
-- some covered by sage and dotted with juniper, some nothing
but the earth stripped down to color. Beyond the site, the
Big Horn Mountains rise up in red cliffs and sharp-peaked
gray triangles of rock split from the mountains, like
chiseled forecasts of mountains. In the distance, long ridges
of buttes extend to the horizon, folded and wrinkled like
monumental waves that crested and were frozen in time. It is
a landscape of immense silence.
   Or was. Within a few days of the discovery by the BLM, a
line of sightseers waited to drive the one-lane road to the
site. At the site itself, a team from the Museum of the
Rockies, headed by Mr. Lieggi and fellow fossil preparator
Bob Harmon, was at work, along with Mr. Breithaupt. With snow
predicted for the end of the week, it was important to get
Big Al out quickly. Part of his skull, a tibia and some
vertebrae were partially exposed when the team arrived. One
of the team's first priorities was to spray the bones with
polyvinyl acetate to protect them from the elementsand from
pack rats (they apparently liked the taste of the temporary
preservative the Swiss had used).
   By the time I arrived, a few bones, already encased in
burlap and plaster, sat to one side. Big Al lay on his left
side, his neck thrown over his back, in the classic death
pose, the right side of his face exposed to light and autumn.
His nose pointed uphill, his large eye socket looked out at
sky. A subadult, he is about 25 feet long. While the
paleontologists know he was rapidly buried, they don't know
why. "One part of the story is why we find the animal as we
do," Mr. Breithaupt explained. "Why is it so well preserved?
What happened after it died? We're gathering the clues."
   As the paleontologists chipped gently away with chisels
and ice picks at the sandstone encasing Big Al, carefully
brushing away the dirt and rock, the dinosaur evolved out of
the rock as if it were crawling out of the earth, ready,
after all this time, to get going.
   I walked over to Howe Quarry, on private land, where the
Swiss had also been digging. Scoured-out terraces of gray
rock form a broad, deep, dry chasm, a sort of
end-of-the-world scene. The quarry has been prospected for
years, providing many bones for many natural history museums.
As I stood there, wondering at the extent of it, Jack Horner,
a native Montanan and curator of paleontology at the Museum
of the Rockies, wandered in. We climbed out of the quarry and
sat down on a hill away from it, in clear view of a fair
amount of geologic time.
   "Those gray rocks are 300 million years old," Mr. Horner
said, pointing to the triangles of rock against the Big
Horns. "Those hills over there are Triassic, sitting on top
of limestone, and the Jurassic is on top of that. That purple
over there is Lower Cretaceous and the hills beyond are
Middle Cretaceous." If I could just follow him around for a
while, I thought, I might begin to understand time.
   I asked him why commercial collectors were a problem.
"Some collect good information," he answered, "but there's no
way for a museum to know who's good and who's not. You can
collect a skeleton and get money for it, so there's no reason
to collect information too. We could end up with dinosaurs
all over the world and they're worthless. What we're trying
to do . . . is save some of the good specimens. . . . It's
good for tourism, for the state, but we're also concerned for
the sciences."
   Mr. Breithaupt put it best: "When bones are sold as a
commodity," he said to me later, "the research story is never
told. People seeing a display of such an animal get, in a
sense, a dead animal. By establishing its environment,
scientists make it live."

<HEAD>Surprising Finds in `Dinosaur Hunt' on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dinosaurs are a kiddie rage these days. There are
dinosaur toys, books, T-shirts, games, party favors.
   ``The Great Dinosaur Hunt,'' tonight on PBS' ``The Infinite
Voyage'' and next week in syndication, is not a kids' show, though
some dinosaur-crazy youngsters might find it interesting.
   This fascinating documentary is taken up not with childish
fantasies, but more adult considerations, such as the history of
dinosaur study and present-day scientific methods that have produced
remarkable new theories about the ex-critters.
   The new theories, rather than drying out the subject, give new
life to the dinosaurs of childhood imagination. According to various
scientists, the vast array of dinosaur species were active hunters,
aggressive fighters, nurturing mothers, sociable herd members,
scavengers and sophisticated communicators.
   ``Nature's special effects,'' they are called, by museum curator
Robert Bakker, a Harvard Ph.D. scientist and author of ``The
Dinosaur Heresies,'' whose waist-length hair and a beard symbolize
his maverick ideas. Bakker believes that, contrary to long-held
popular and scientific belief, dinosaurs were not stupid,
cold-blooded reptiles, but a unique, warm-blooded, active animal.
   Bakker supported his theory by studying dinosaur tracks
discovered in a riverbed near Glen Rose, Texas. By comparing the
estimated height of the animal's leg with the distance between the
tracks, Bakker concluded that it traveled at a brisk 8 mph or so,
faster than a pack of wolves, not at the sluggish speed of a
cold-blooded reptile lazily foraging for food.
   ``Their world was not one of the cold-blooded shuffle, but of the
hot-blooded cruise,'' he says.
   Phillip Currie studied mysterious ``bone beds'' in Alberta,
Canada, and developed the theory that they were the remains of
members of a dinosaur herd who died trying to ford a river en masse,
as herding animals still sometimes do today. Later, another species
of dinosaur fed on the remains _ Currie found bite marks on the
bones _ and added more fossils to the bone beds.
   Paleontologist Jack Horner's study of dinosaur eggs revealed that
some species emerged fully developed and ready to run off in search
of food, while others needed lengthy nurturing in the nest. They
later became predator and prey.
   David Weishampel studied the unexplained hollow crest that topped
the heads of some dinosaur species and concluded that it provided an
amplification tunnel between vocal box and snout. By reconstructing
the crest with plastic tubing, he produces a low-frequency bellow
that the animals probably used more than 70 million years ago to
communicate with each other. A low-frequency noise, not unlike the
bellow of an elephant, would have carried a long distance, but been
difficult for a predator, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, to locate.
   Bakker believes that rather than dying out completely, dinosaurs
were the predecessors of today's 8,400 species of birds. By studying
a species of dinosaur closely related to ``T. Rex,'' as he
affectionately calls the mega-lizard, Bakker concluded that the
structural similarities between dinosaurs and modern birds made them
obvious relatives.
   ``So when you look at your canary, you're seeing a bit of T.
Rex,'' Bakker says.
   The demise of the dinosaurs remains a mystery. They could have
died of a widespread virus, or they might have been the victims of a
sudden cataclysm, such as a collision between Earth and a giant
meteor.
   Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard University
says the dinosaurs ruled the Earth for 140 million years while
mammals were small creatures that occupied the nooks and crannies of
their world. So there's no reason that they might not have continued
their reign another 60 million years, leaving mammals to be inferior
and dominated.
   Lest we look back with pity on the poor, long-dead dinosaur,
Gould cheerfully points out, ``All species eventually become
extinct.''

<HEADLINE>  SCIENTISTS HOPE ANCIENT DNA WILL PROVIDE
WINDOW TO PAST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It sounds like a Stephen Spielberg movie -- and it will be -- but some
scientists believe the concept of regenerating long-dead animals from bits of
DNA is not so far-fetched.;    A major reason for their optimism is the recent
development of a laboratory technique called the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), which was invented by Emeryville scientists.;    A method for
amplifying minute quantities of genetic material, even if old and fragmentary,
it has prompted a run by scientists on museum collections of extinct animals
and plants, as well as on ancient human remains, in the hope of extracting any
DNA, the basic genetic material, that has survived the centuries.;    One of
these scientists is Dr. George O. Poinar Jr., a paleontologist at the
University of California, Berkeley. Based on his research, Poinar suggested
the dinosaur-resurrection scenario that became the basis of the best-selling
science-fiction novel "Jurassic Park," by Michael Crichton (1990, Knopf).;   
'Idea is quite plausible';  "I think the idea is quite plausible," Poinar
said, "and I feel the possibility for doing something like this will exist in
the future.";    Paleontologists and anthropologists have begun using the
technique as a window into the past, through which evolutionary paths,
migration patterns, kinship and other relationships can be brought to light.; 
  Some early fruits of this research will be reported at "Ancient DNA," the
first such international meeting, at the University of Nottingham in England
next month.;    How much of the distant past will prove visible through the
PCR window is still a matter of conjecture.;    No one can yet answer the most
basic questions, including how long DNA -- deoxyribonucleic acid -- can
survive, how much can be inferred from degraded sections of the huge DNA
molecules or how trustworthy the extraction processes may be.;    Scientists
wild about method;    Still, that has not stopped scientists at more than a
score of research institutions from enjoying themselves enormously in applying
the method to the DNA of objects as diverse as ancient Andean corn,
prehistoric Florida Indian brains, flightless New Zealand birds, leaves
preserved in shale for 17 million years and living bacteria from the gut of a
12,000-year-old mastodon found in Ohio.;    PCR analysis was invented and
patented in 1985 by scientists at the Cetus Corp. The instrument that
amplifies trace quantities of DNA is about the size of a shoe box.;    By
cyclically changing the temperature of the contents and by supplying various
building-block chemicals, the device splits apart paired strands of
corkscrew-shape DNA molecules and uses each strand as a template to create a
new DNA segment.;    With each repetition of the procedure, the number of
identical DNA segments is doubled, and trillions of copies can be manufactured
rapidly. The result is that fragments of DNA formerly too small to analyze can
be amplified easily for study.;    A feature of the system is that scientists
can select any section of interest from a DNA molecule -- typically, a single
set of genes -- and amplify only that part.;    Other uses of the method;   
PCR, a vital technique for those involved in pure research, has already found
practical use in identifying criminals, diagnosing genetic diseases and
detecting predispositions to certain types of cancer. But it has created an
especially powerful tool for paleontologists and anthropologists.;    The
excitement about the resuscitation potential of PCR is not universal.;    Dr.
Svante Paabo of the University of Munich, a molecular geneticist formerly of
the University of California, Berkeley, worked with Dr. Allan Wilson and Dr.
Russell G. Higuchi in 1984 on a landmark study of the DNA of the quagga, an
extinct South African animal related to the horse.;    From an analysis of DNA
extracted from a 140-year-old quagga skin preserved in a German museum, the
Berkeley group determined that the quagga was a distant relative of the horse.
Paabo believes it would be impossible to re-create the quagga from its DNA,
much less recreate a dinosaur.;    But Poinar remains optimistic. In 1982,
Poinar and his wife, Dr. Roberta Hess, also of UC-Berkeley, obtained and
examined a 40 million-year-old chunk of amber -- fossilized resin -- in which
a female fungus gnat was embedded.;    Gnat was well-preserved;  The tissues
and cells of the gnat were so well-preserved that the scientists concluded
that DNA might have survived in insects of similar age.;    Poinar did not
look for DNA in the fungus gnat, because the search would have required
destroying a very rare and valuable specimen.;    But, he said, biting insects
undoubtedly consumed blood and accompanying DNA from contemporary animals,
including dinosaurs, and some of this blood and DNA could survive, trapped in
amber.;    "Obviously, we couldn't reconstruct an extinct animal today, even
if we had all its DNA," he said in an interview. "However, my belief is that
there are dinosaur cells inside biting flies trapped in amber of (the)
Cretaceous age and older. It's just a matter of finding the dinosaur DNA and
getting it out."  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oldest dinosaur may have been shorter than
former basketball star Wilt Chamberlain and lighter than football
star William ``Refrigerator'' Perry.
   It was puny for a dinosaur. It scampered along on the toes of
its rear feet but had ``large claws on its forelimbs, used to grasp
prey,'' said University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno.
   More importantly, Sereno and other scientists said Thursday they
believe the first drawing of the ancient Herrerasaurus may reveal
important clues into the evolution of dinosaurs.
   ``Before, only a few bones of Herrerasaurus were known,'' said
Sereno. ``Now, we have everything.
   ``Basically we have the first relatively complete idea of what
the primitive form of the dinosaur looks like. This will help us in
trying to figure out the pathways of evolution that proceeded over
the course of many millions of years after that.''
   Scientists welcomed Sereno's work, presented Thursday in Austin,
Texas, at meetings of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists.
   ``I think it's extremely important to know what the thing looks
like in detail,'' said Nicholas Hotton, curator of fossils,
amphibians and reptiles at the Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History. ``If you've got that kind of information, you can
tell which way evolution is going.''
   Sereno said the artist's reconstruction of the dinosaur _ named
after an Argentine goat herder _ was based largely on the recent
discovery of a skull and two nearly complete skeletons in South
America.
   Working with South American colleagues Alfredo Monetta and Jose
Bonaparte, Sereno discovered the fossils in the foothills of the
Andes.
   ``There is definitely a certain amount of good fortune in these
things,'' said Sereno, who last month won a $500,000 Packard
Foundation Award that will allow him to continue work on the
Herrerasaurus and other research projects, including a study of
ancient birds.
   The Herrerasaurus, which scampered the Earth some 230 million
years ago, was Earth's first true dinosaur. ``Basically, you go
back further and you get dinosaur-type things but not a dinosaur,''
he said.
   Herrerasaurus weighed a mere 300 pounds and stood between 6 feet
and 8 feet tall, Sereno said. The Chicago Bears' Perry weighs in at
325 pounds, while Chamberlain stands 7 feet, 1 inch high.
   Like all other dinosaurs, Herrerasaurus roamed the earth for
only a few million years before becoming extinct. Scientists aren't
sure what doomed the tiny first dinosaur, Sereno said.
   With the new representation of the animal, ``We finally have
some idea of the path of history,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sculptor Creates Dinosaurs From Junk Auto Parts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sculptor Jim Gary looks at the rusting oil pan
from a junked automobile and he sees the gaping jaw of a dinosaur.
   Under his welding torch, the metallic bones and joints of
extinct automotive behemoths from Detroit are reincarnated as
Gary's artistic vision of the prehistoric giants that crawled from
the ooze to roam our planet millions of years ago.
   Gary, a self-taught sculptor from Farmingdale, N.J., has built
more than 200 of his ``20th century dinosaurs'' from the brake
shoes, universal joints, leaf springs, drive shafts, hoods, front
ends and other parts of scrapped cars and trucks.
   Some of his larger creatures, he says, required more than 500
parts from as many as a dozen automobiles and took a year to
complete. He prefers the parts from older cars, dating back to
1960, because they have more character.
   One of his biggest dinosaurs, the 57-foot-long Diplodocus,
contains more than $5,000 worth of junk parts.
   The plates along the arched back of the evil-looking Stegosaurus
were a challenge. Gary finally took them from the inner walls of a
wrecked garbage compactor.
   Eighteen of Gary's skeletal dinosaur sculptures in rich yellows,
greens, purples and blues or natural rust, plus four brightly
colored dragon flies, are making their Washington debut Thursday at
the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.
   The works will be on display through Aug. 10 as part of a new
museum show titled ``Dinamation's Dinosaurs Alive and in Color,''
which features a collection of computer-controlled robotic
dinosaurs that roar and squeal, rip meat from carcasses, tend their
offspring and crane their necks toward spectators.
   The main show, now touring the United States, was created by
Dinamation International Corp. of California and will be on view at
the museum through Sept. 3 for an admission fee of $4 for adults
and $2 for children. Gary's exhibit will be free.
   His dinosaurs have toured museums in the United States, Japan
and Australia since 1979. They have been pictured in school
textbooks, magazines and an encyclopedia, and made an appearance in
the George Lucas movie, ``Howard the Duck.''
   Gary learned about cars as a kid growing up in Colts Neck, N.J.,
where he picked up enough junkyard parts to build and license two
homemade jalopies. Years later, as a sculptor searching for unusual
art supplies, he returned to his old childhood haunts.
   ``When I saw those heaps of junked cars,'' he said, ``it
reminded me of an elephant graveyard. Just as elephants went to the
graveyard to die, those old cars went to the junkyard to die.''
   Gary saw a parallel between old cars and dinosaurs, the
chrome-finned gas guzzlers and the prehistoric plant eaters. Both
died out and were replaced by smaller, more fuel-efficient species.
   ``The car really is an animal. It has its own metabolism and
needs fuel, air and water to exist,'' he said. ``To survive it had
to change, just like the dinosaurs. The evolution of the two is
obvious.''
   Gary envisions the junkyard as a burial ground for the discarded
artifacts of 20th century technology, where future scientists might
study the remains of scrapped cars just as paleontologists examine
fossils for clues about how dinosaurs lived and died.
   ``It's not my intention to suggest that the auto industry is
going the way of the dinosaur,'' Gary said hastily. ``I'm just
doing my work as a sculptor.''

SOME SCIENTISTS TRACE BIRDS TO GIANT CARNIVORES  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     (b) Elephant enclosure.;    (c) Bird building.;    A smart tyrannosaur --
and there is some evidence to suggest they weren't as dumb as they looked --
would pick (c), according to Jacques Gauthier, associate curator of
herpetology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.;    That
same dinosaur could make the argument that he never really became extinct, he
just evolved.;    "Birds are living theropods," said Gauthier. "They retain
the ancestral characteristics of dinosaurs. . . . Birds are deeply embedded in
that group of theropod dinosaurs in the same way that humans are deeply
embedded in primates.";    The dinosaur or the egg?;  Although more emphatic
than many of his colleagues about the link between birds and certain kinds of
dinosaurs, Gauthier's comments are symptomatic of a chicken-and-egg
relationship that may help explain a wealth of recently discovered evidence of
dinosaur behavior.;    This evidence suggests that some dinosaurs built nests
of vegetable matter and used them over and over, cared for their young by
protecting them from predators and regurgitating food, had endothermic
(warm-blooded) circulatory systems, and swallowed stones to help digest food.;
   Such discoveries have spurred a revolution in popular thinking about
dinosaurs. Books by paleontologists considered radical -- Jack Horner of
Montana State University and Robert Bakker of the University of Colorado, to
name a couple -- have dismissed dinosaurs' image as cold-blooded pea-brains or
overgrown iguanas and replaced it with an image of warm-blooded creatures
sophisticated enough to last 150 million years as the Earth's leading
citizens.;    Nothing surprising;  To Gauthier, 42, who holds a doctorate from
the University of California, Berkeley, none of that should be too
surprising.;    "The evidence has always been there," he said, "but it was
obscured by a bunch of political and sociological reasons. It just stuck in
people's minds that dinosaurs were like lizards, and not birds, and for
decades, that's the way they were studied.";    Gauthier and others point an
accusing finger at the traditional methods of classification of creatures by a
few arbitrarily selected traits -- "if it swims, it's a fish; if it flies,
it's a bird; if it crawls on its belly, it's a reptile.";    "Classifications
don't mean much," said Kevin McGowan, an ornithologist at Cornell University
in New York. "For example, you're probably closer to a perch than a perch is
to a shark. And once you look at it that way, it's perfectly logical that a
crocodile would have more in common with a bird than it would with a turtle,
and a bird would have more things in common with a certain kind of dinosaur
than a lizard would.";    New possibilities;  Once you break away from
thinking of dinosaurs as nothing more than a collection of big lizards,
Gauthier contends, the door opens for thinking about some of them --
meat-eating theropods like the tyrannosaur, allosaurus and deinonychus, for
example -- as the ancestors of birds.;    Take, for example, the development
of wings.;    As these archosaurs -- or "ruling reptiles" -- evolved,
according to Gauthier's theory, they developed the ability to control body
heat, in effect becoming warm-blooded.;    They got their forelimbs off the
ground. The limbs developed a muscular structure that allowed the animals to
use their "arms" to reach down and grab prey, then reach up with enough
strength to hold the struggling prey long enough to kill and eat it -- a
down-and-forward, up-and-back motion that is basically the same used by birds
to fly.;    Then came feathers, developed initially by some smaller archosaurs
as a way of keeping warm.;    "They already had the flight stroke down," said
Gauthier, "so the sky was no longer the limit in the development of theropod
dinosaurs.";    Gauthier's ideas aren't universally accepted. For one thing,
some scientists contend that flight developed from creatures who swooped and
glided from trees, rather than those who took off from the ground up. And
there's no hard evidence to suggest how feathers were developed.;    What most
do agree on is that there is clear fossil evidence of at least a lineal link
between birds and dinosaurs. The most well-known is archaeoptryx, a feathered,
winged creature with a mouthful of sharp teeth that lived 145 million years
ago.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Scientists Find 225-Million-Year-Old Fossil Bed in Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists excavating an ancient lake shore in
Virginia say a concentration of fossils there dates from a time
when the area was a lush tropical forest and creatures resembling
armored monsters roamed the Earth.
   Hans-Dieter Sues, a Smithsonian Institution paleobiologist, said
Thursday that the rich collection of fossil remains are from a
variety of animals that lived 225 million years ago and some are of
a type never before found.
   ``Many of these are not known because rocks from this particular
chunk of time are not found anywhere else in the world,'' said Sues
in an interview. ``This is the first time that we've got a really
diverse group of land animals from this part of geologic time.''
   Sues said the largest assembled fossil includes the body, but
not the head, of a five-foot-long reptile resembling an
armor-plated crocodile.
   ``This creature had two rows on its back of this very massive
bony plate and huge spines sticking out on the side,'' said Sues.
``It's like something from a Japanese monster movie. It is a
funny-looking creature and an entirely new type of animal.''
   Sues said the Triassic period fossils were found in a formation
of stone called mudrock about 15 miles southwest of Richmond.
   The assemblage includes many fossils from a group of animals
called cynodonts, the closest reptile ancestors of the mammal. Sues
said the fossils include parts for a cynodont about the size of a
small dog, and other parts from a mammal-like reptile measuring 5
to 10 inches long.
   Sues said fragments of fossils of this type have been found in
the northern hemisphere, but never in such a large group.
Individual cynodont fossils also have been found in Argentina,
Brazil and in southern Africa.
   ``This is further evidence for the super continent of Pangaea,
when all of the continents were one large giant land mass,'' he
said, because fossils from the same species and the same era can be
found on continents that now are separated.
   It is thought that during the geologic period called Triassic,
between 240 to 205 million years ago, all of the Earth's land area
was connected in one large mass called Pangaea. The land mass
slowly split apart, as massive plates drifted away from each other
over millions of years, and the continents and islands eventually
arranged themselves in their present positions.
   Sues said that when the cynodonts and other creatures lived in
what is now Virginia, the area was near the equator and the climate
was tropical and humid, with lush vegetation.
   ``You had these huge fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the
whole area,'' he said. ``You had an incredible variety of animals.
There were plant eaters and a whole variety of meat eaters.''
   Sues said the cynodont fossils found in the assemblage include
five very small jaw bones, apparently from hatchlings, six larger
jaw bones, and the back bone and head from a still-larger animal.
   ``The cynodonts were creatures that were the precursors for true
mammals,'' he said. ``They are not mammals themselves, but were
species that gave rise to mammals.''
   One of the small jaw fossils is attached to a detailed mold of
the brain, and Sues said this may enable scientists to learn more
about how the mammalian brain developed.
   Most of the Triassic period reptiles died out as dinosaurs began
to evolve into the dominant animal, around the time the first
mammal is thought to have evolved.
   ``This find gives further evidence that mammals and dinosaurs
probably evolved at the same time,'' Sues said. ``The dinosaur
became very successful and remained successful for the next 140
million years and mammals were sort of pushed over the side and
only became important and successful after the dinosaurs went
extinct.''
   Dinosaurs became extinct, for reasons still not understood,
about 65 million years ago, and mammals, such as mankind, evolved
into the dominant animal.
   The fossil deposit was found by Paul E. Olsen, a geologist with
the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.
   Olsen was conducting a survey in the area in 1985, Sues said,
and chanced onto a small fossil. Sues identified it as a cynodont
part and the National Geographic Society supported further
exploration leading to the discovery of the large fossil deposit.

<LEADPARA>  Scientists are chipping the bones of a 70-foot dinosaur from its sandstone
grave in Montana, but they don't know what they'll do with the giant skeleton
after they dig it up.;    An arm bone and two 6-foot-long rib bones belonging
to a brontosaur have been unearthed, said paleontologist Jack Horner of the
Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman.  </LEADPARA>

SCIENTISTS DIGGING UP 70-FOOTER IN MONTANA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It could take three years to free the whole skeleton, giving scientists
time to figure out where they will keep it.;    "We don't even have enough
room to store it, let alone put it up" for display, Horner said.;    At least
one smaller brontosaur, and probably two, lie within a few feet of the 70-foot
dinosaur, he said. The brontosaurs are 145 million to 150 million years old,
which is about 50 million years older than any dinosaur found in Montana.;   
The find is unique because of the flat, semiarid plain habitat brontosaurs
dealt with during the Jurassic Age, Horner said. There were a few reeds and
cattails, but no deciduous trees or grasses the dinosaurs probably preferred.;
   "It's a real puzzle, trying to find out what they ate," Horner said. "They
didn't need a 30-foot neck to eat a cattail.";    For now, Horner is leaning
toward the theory that brontosaurs lived on pine needles. But the theory
doesn't sit quite right with him, partly because he can't think of any modern
animal that could live on pine needles.;    Meanwhile, in Jackson, Wyo., two
paleontologists recently retrieved three rare dinosaur tracks from the Teton
Wilderness, possibly the prints of an animal never before discovered.  </TEXT>

FT  30 MAY 92 / The revival of the species: The rebirth of the extinct
quagga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   THE QUAGGA is extinct
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or at least it was, until a team of international scientists began trying to
resurrect this zebra-like creature, native to the arid vastness of South
Africa's Karoo.
Coloured rich brown to blend in with the red dust of the Karoo - a huge,
infertile, sparsely populated area of the Cape - the quagga looked like a
zebra with less than half the normal stripes. Karoo farmers saw it as an
unwelcome competitor for grazing, and set out to exterminate it. The last
specimen died more than a hundred years ago in an Amsterdam zoo.
Now scientists believe they can bring back the quagga, named by the original
Hottentot inhabitants of the Karoo for the distinctive sound it made. At a
nature reserve 200 kilometres north-east of Cape Town, they have begun
selectively breeding plains zebras (the striped animals most familiar to
Europeans), hoping to restore the distinctive colouration of the quagga.
If they succeed, there is a chance that other long-dead animals could be
saved from extinction - but only if they are closely related to an extant
species which can be used as a breeding base. The dinosaur and the
brontosaurus will remain in oblivion; but scientists might, for example, be
able to recreate the extinct blue antelope.
In fact, the only hope for resurrecting the quagga is that it is not truly
'extinct'. Genetic research has shown that it was a sub-species of the
plains zebra; scientists believe its colouration may simply be diluted in
the extant population of such zebras, where isolated individuals (darker in
colour and faintly striped) already slightly resemble quaggas.
This resemblance is borne out by genetic evidence: DNA extracted from dried
tissue and blood of stuffed quaggas matches that of the plains Zebra,
proving that the quagga is a sub-species.
'If a species is gone, nothing can be done about it because the entire gene
pool is gone,' says Reinhold Rau, head of taxidermy at the South African
museum in Cape Town, and the father of the quagga project. But the gene pool
of the plains zebra is still available for re-breeding the quagga, by a
process similar to selective breeding of livestock.
Baby Reina, one of six foals who form the first generation of the quagga
breeding project, demonstrates how it is done. She was born of parents
specially selected in the wild for their faint striping, and her stripes are
fainter still. But scientists were not so lucky with the other foals: one
has distinctly more prominent stripes than either parent, and the others
show little progress toward quagga colouration. Scientists hope to see firm
results in 10 years - but it could take longer.
Some wildlife experts dispute the validity of the project: 'We can breed a
zebra which will look like a quagga but it will never, ever be a quagga. All
we know about the quagga was what it looked like and where it was found. We
know nothing about its behaviour, its habitat . . . ' says Zane Erasmus,
ranger at the Vrolijkheid Nature Reserve where the breeding is being done.
Scientists were not able to get a full genetic fingerprint of the quagga,
because none of the crucial 'nuclear DNA' survived in the stuffed specimens;
so they will never know whether a re-bred quagga is just a man-made
lookalike or a truly genetic recreation.
And after several generations in captivity the quagga may no longer be able
to survive in the wild. But if they can be released into Karoo nature
reserves, where there are no major predators, it would be a small step
towards rectifying the damage done by man to Africa's wildlife.

<HEAD>Dinosaur Bones Found In Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fossil bones of a plant-eating dinosaur found in
the Antarctic prove there was a mild climate there 70 million years
ago, a British scientist said Thursday.
   ``We discovered jawbones, much of the vertebral column and the
fore limbs, which identify the animal as a bird-hipped dinosaur
similar to hypsilophodon, which has been found in Australia, North
Amerca, Europe and possibly North Africa,'' said Michael Thomson, a
scientist who led an expedition to the area.
   ``There could not have been much ice or snow in the region in
those days because the dinosaur was a land animal and it wouldn't
have liked frosty nights.''
   He said the dinosaur was about 10 feet long and walked on its
hind legs.
   Thomson, 46, spoke in a telephone interview from Cambridge, where
he is head of geology at the British Antarctic Survey.
   He said the expedition also found shells, especially ammonites;
fossilized leaves from conifers and broad-leaved trees, as well as
tree trunks and ferns, proving there was a food source for the
dinosaur.
   Thomson said the fossils were found during a six-week geological
research cruise this year around the north and east of James Ross
Island in British Antarctic Territory, 700 miles from the tip of
South America.
   He said the dinosaur bones were picked up and given to him by
Peter Bengtson, a Swedish paleontologist who joined scientists from
Britain, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand for the voyage on the
survey ship John Biscoe.
   ``Three years ago, we found some bones of a marine reptile, the
plesiosaur, and as Argentine geologists had found fragments of an
armored dinosaur in Antarctica, I knew it was a likely place for
other finds,'' Thomson said.
   The bones were in shallow-water marine rocks and Thomson said the
beast probably died on land and floated out to sea before becoming
buried and fossilized.
   ``There were active volcanoes nearby in those times and the area
would have been something like Indonesia is today,'' he added.
   Thomson described the area as several square miles of bare rock
with only mosses and lichens _ ``and not many of those'' _ growing
there now.
   The continents in the Southern Hemisphere were once a single land
mass that has been named Gondwanaland. About 150 million years ago,
it began to split apart, eventually to form South America, Africa,
Australia and Antarctica.
   The newly found dinosaur would have been one of the last of its
kind because the animals were starting to die out about that time,
when Antarctica was still close to South America and Australia was
only starting to break away, Thomson said.
   The bones are now under study at the Natural History Museum in
London, where they may eventually be put on display.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Tyrannosaurus resurrectus: Fossil futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and ALISON HENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steven Spielberg describes his latest blockbuster film Jurassic Park, which
opened in the US last night, as 'not science fiction but science
eventuality'. The Hollywood publicity machine has made sure that most
Americans already know its plot: scientists use genetic engineering to
create a theme park with real dinosaurs which then run amok.
This week - with a sense of timing that the best Hollywood hype merchant
could not have matched - the venerable British research journal Nature
published evidence suggesting that the movie is slightly less far-fetched
than it may sound. A Californian research group including Dr George Poinar,
a scientific adviser to Jurassic Park, has extracted the first samples of
genetic material (DNA) from the dinosaur era.
Admittedly, the 120m-year-old DNA came from an extinct weevil rather than a
dinosaur. And the Californian scientists isolated just fragments of two
genes rather than the 100,000 or so complete genes that would provide full
instructions for anyone wanting to recreate the insect.
But they have demonstrated two propositions that would have seemed wildly
speculative less than 10 years ago. First, the DNA molecule is robust enough
to survive for millions of years under the right conditions. Second,
scientists can fish out microscopic quantities of DNA and then make billions
of copies for analysis (using gene-amplifying technology called polymerase
chain reaction).
The link between Jurassic Park and the Poinar group's real-life discovery is
amber, fossilised tree resin which has unique sealing and antiseptic
properties. It is a honey-coloured time capsule, transporting trapped
insects virtually intact from prehistoric forest to laboratory bench.
The Californian scientists worked on a tree-feeding weevil preserved in
amber from Jezzine, Lebanon. Michael Crichton, who wrote the novel, Jurassic
Park, imagined extracting DNA from blood in the gut of a mosquito that had
fed on a dinosaur just before it was trapped in the resin.
Unfortunately for the story, the vast majority of insects in amber are
species that live or feed on trees, such as weevils, termites, ants and
bees. Only a handful of specimens of blood-sucking insects are known from
the dinosaur era (older than 65m years) - and scientists will be
fantastically lucky if they contain dinosaur DNA that had not been broken
down by digestive juices.
The greatest possible piece of luck would be to find a recently hatched baby
dinosaur in amber - extremely unlikely but not out of the question. After
all, lizards and frogs have been preserved in 40m-year-old amber from the
Dominican Republic.
However, amber is not the only potential source of dinosaur DNA. In
exceptional cases, the molecules may be robust enough to survive inside
dinosaur fossils. Professor Jack Horner of Montana State University is
attempting to find genetic material in bones of the ferocious Tyrannosaurus
rex, which have been preserved in extremely dry sandstone beds.
Even if scientists do manage to extract dinosaur DNA from any source, it is
hard to see how this could include the whole genome - the blueprint that
would be the first requirement for resurrecting dinosaurs.
For the foreseeable future, any mad billionaire who really wants to create a
Jurassic Park would do better to forget genes and build on the technique Mr
Spielberg used for his movie: computer-controlled robotic dinosaurs. Over
the next decade or two, artificial intelligence and bio-materials
engineering will advance to the point at which it would be possible to
create a lifelike Tyrannosaurus rex that behaved with terrifying
unpredictability.
For the palaeogeneticist studying ancient DNA, the ultimate objective is not
to recreate any species - insect or dinosaur. The point is first to track
evolution at the molecular level by following genetic changes over millions
of years. The research may also reveal facts about an extinct creature and
its lifestyle that are impossible to discover from conventional fossils.
Knowledge of a few intact genes from dinosaurs could answer many
controversial questions about their evolution and relationship to today's
reptiles, birds and mammals. And discovering a gene for a digestive enzyme,
for example, would be a strong clue about what a particular dinosaur ate.
Although recreating a whole dinosaur is out of the question, anyone who
isolated an individual gene would find it relatively easy to insert this
into today's living creatures, employing methods already used routinely to
transfer genes between species. Human genes, for instance, have been
inserted into sheep, so that the human proteins required for medical
purposes can be extracted from the animals' milk.
If scientists managed to isolate one dinosaur gene and insert it into a
crocodile embryo, the creature would still grow up looking and behaving like
a croc because its development would be controlled by thousands of its own
genes. But it might produce some dinosaur protein.
An enterprising company could make a fortune breeding and promoting the
resulting crocodiles, even if just a millionth of their genetic material
came from a dinosaur. Imagine Florida restaurants serving crocodine steaks
or Tokyo department stores selling dinocroc shoes and handbags.
Biotechnologists, who are already nervous about the likely impact of
Jurassic Park on public attitudes to genetic engineering, dislike such
speculation. But it is a plausible scenario 20 years from now. Mr
Spielberg's eventuality is unlikely to come to pass for 100 years, if at
all.

<HEAD>Farm Couple Finds Rare Tyrannosaurus Rex Skeleton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JORDAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton discovered by
a pair of amateur fossil hunters is yielding new insights on the
fearsome carnivore because it includes the only complete arm yet
found.
   Paleontologists unearthing the fossilized skeleton in the
badlands of eastern Montana say it appears to be the most complete
yet found of the biggest species of predatory dinosaur.
   ``We're pretty excited,'' said Patrick Leiggi, one of those at
the site. ```T rex' may be a household name among dinosaurs, but no
one's ever found a complete one, and that's what we've done.''
   The skeleton was spotted a year ago by Tom and Kathy Wankel of
Angela, Mont., on a fossil-hunting trip. They picked up some bones
they found protruding from the ground and turned them over to
experts at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman.
   ``We decided that what we had didn't mean much to us and might
be important to someone else,'' Mrs. Wankel said Tuesday. ``At the
museum they were very excited. They knew immediately that it was
part of the shoulder blade and arm of a large carnivore.''
   The pieces brought to the museum by the Wankels proved to be the
most complete arm of a T-rex ever discovered, according to Jack
Horner, head of the museum's paleontology effort. It will help
researchers learn how the short but strong arms of the dinosaur
were used.
   The crew from the museum began digging up the fossils last
month. They're keeping the exact location of the find secret to
deter looting; generally, it's in the Hell's Creek area north of
Jordan, a rich area for dinosaur hunters.
   Working in a pit 20 feet long and up to 10 feet wide, workers
uncovered 24 connected vertebrae in a serpentine pattern, preserved
in spot where the dinosaur died 65 million years ago.
   T-rex skeletons are rare _ only nine nearly complete skeletons
have ever been discovered and all but two came from Montana. Only
three complete skulls have been found.
   Although an adult T-rex could be to 35 feet long, 18 feet high
and weigh as much as an elephant at nearly 6.5 tons, the arms were
no longer than an adult man. Researchers had theorized that the
arms were either used only for mating, or perhaps were slowly
evolving away.
   Matt Smith of the museum's paleontology crew said that studying
the bones found by the Wankels show that the arm was very stout _
and very strong.
   Until now, all the T-rex skeletons found in Montana have been
shipped to museums out of state, but this one will stay at the
Museum of the Rockies.

   The best news for fans of animated movies came
with last week's box-office report which showed big grosses for
``The Land Before Time'' and ``Oliver and Company.''
   Revival of animation, the most tedious and expensive kind of
filmmaking, has been predicted every few years. Until recently,
though, economics made animation features risky. But in their first
weekend ``The Land Before Time'' topped all releases with $7.5
million in 1,395 theaters ($5,395 average), and ``Oliver and
Company'' in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no. 4 with $4
million ($4,226 average).
   Those are big numbers, and they're likely to grow through the
holiday season. That's encouraging for the animation trade, which
has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but
the nature of the audience.
   ``A large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission
price,'' said Don Bluth, who produced ``The Land before Time.''
   ``If we make a boffo with a picture, it's because we sold more
tickets.'' Bluth, who formerly worked for the Disney Co., cautiously
predicts a renaissance of animation.
   Walt Disney Pictures, which produced ``Oliver and Company,'' has
pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional
facility at the Disney-MGM studio tour in Florida. Roy E. Disney,
nephew of Walt, is largely responsible for the revival. Four years
ago when Roy helped create a new management at Disney, the outlook
was dismal.
   ``Animation was dying around here,'' he said in an interview at
his studio office. ``There had been 10 years of a kind of lack of
faith in it, and a lack of direction to it. There were an awful lot
of discouraged artists working here.
   ``We were finishing up `The Black Cauldron,' which had been an
enormous seven-year effort, with the kind of strange idea of doing
an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of
what the story was. There were a lot of people who thought we just
weren't going forward with the animation department. There was even
talk of getting out of the movie business entirely.''
   Disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads,
who were trained in live-action films, to the uniqueness of the
animation process.
   ``First of all, it's a matter of time; `Oliver,' for eample, took
four years to complete,'' he said. His campaign was aided by having
``The Great Mouse Detective'' in good story form. When the movie
proved a hit, all doubts were erased.
   ``Oliver and Company'' resulted from a ``Gong Show'' session in
which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas.
Most were shot down, but an updated ``Oliver Twist'' survived.
Members of Fagin's gang became dogs, as was the newcomer, Oliver.
But during story development Oliver became a kitten.
   The young animators worked at a fast clip, inspired by the
casting of the voices, including Bette Midler, Billy Joel, Dom
DeLuise and Robert Loggia. Many of the new artists have come from
the Disney-endowed California Institute of the Arts, but Disney
observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art.
   The studio won't reveal the cost of ``Oliver and Company,'' but
Disney said it was in the middle range for an animated feature
(estimate: $18 million). Computers will increasingly relieve some of
the tedium of inking and painting, he said, helping to bring down
expenses.
   ``But the animation of a character, hand-drawn in pencil I think
will never change,'' he said.
   Bluth, who produced ``The Land Before Time'' for $12 million,
found a way to reduce animation expense: He moved his entire studio
to Ireland because of the labor cost of animation. The Irish
government offered a 10-year commitment for tax breaks, grants for
Irish artists who would be trained and access to bank loans, he said.
   ``It was like Moses leading the children of Israel out of
Egypt,'' said Bluth. ``The artists had to pull up all their stakes;
many of them sold their homes.
   ``Many of them have bought homes there, they all have Irish
accents, some have joined the Catholic church. It's a conversion to
another way of life. I don't think many plan to stay there forever.
But they have embraced the Irish society.''
   Bluth led an earlier exodus of Disney animators during the
studio's low period and produced ``The Secret of NIMH,'' a failure.
Then he combined with Steven Spielberg on ``An American Tail,'' a
rousing success. ``The Land Before Time'' also resulted from a
Spielberg idea.
   ```I can't understand why no one has made a film about
dinosaurs,''' Bluth recalled Spielberg telling him. ```It's a
natural. There is a great interest in dinosaurs. George Lucas and
myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times, but we didn't
want to do it with puppets; we tried that and it didn't work.'''
   With Spielberg and Lucas as executive producers, Bluth could
hardly miss. He admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs, but he said
Spielberg told him: ```You can learn.'''
   Bluth and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating
dinosaurs: ``For instance, the brontosaurus with the long neck. It
has a little head, like a ball on a stick. It doesn't have the
shoulders and the hands to give you gestures. It all has to be done
with facial expressions.''
   But how to make the beasts move? Bluth and company reasoned that
the prehistoric creatures were reptiles, and birds evolved from
reptilian forms. So the artists copied moves from films of chickens
and turkeys.
   After the opening of ``The Land Before Time,'' Bluth returned to
the Dublin studio where production is under way on the next feature,
``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' which takes place in the hereafter.

<TEXT>
   Scientists plan to reassemble a 60-foot-long
``lord of the sea'' that is believed to be about 20 feet longer
than the discovered remains of other sea lizards.
   Robert T. Bakker, University of Colorado Museum Curator, said
fossilized mosasaurs have been found in other parts of the world.
But he said ``the largest we know of were in the 40-foot-long
range.''
   ``It was the lord of the sea and there is nothing like it
today,'' Bakker said of the creature.
   He said the Lowndes County site, more than 100 miles from the
Gulf of Mexico, was about 100 feet under water when mosasaurs ruled
the depths.
   ``Mosasaurs became extinct along with dinosaurs at the end of
the Mesozoic era,'' about 70 million years before the appearance of
humans, said Doug Jones, director of the University of Alabama
Museum of Natural History.
   Bakker and Jones visited Saturday at the site of the dig, which
started about one month ago.
   The scientists said the lizard had a six-foot-long head and a
two-hinged jaw capable of swallowing a cow.
   ``If a tyrannosaurus rex ever ventured into the water around
where one of those was, it would have more than had its hands
full,'' Bakker said as he scraped clay from part of the jawbone.
   ``It could swallow a Hereford steer whole and probably could go
through a herd one at a time _ it was that large,'' Bakker said.
   The discovery was made by Jones and Jerry Oldshue, the assistant
vice president for student affairs at Alabama. University officials
said they hope to take the fossilized remains to Tuscaloosa to be
reassembled.
   Oyster shells and other evidence of sea life was found by the
paleontologists Saturday, including some that had become fossilized
on parts of the uncovered mosasaur.
   Jones said it would be ``many weeks'' before the dig is complete.
   ``We want to make sure we can preserve what we have here,'' he
said.

   The best news for fans of animated movies came
with last week's box-office report which showed big grosses for
``The Land Before Time'' and ``Oliver and Company.''
   Revival of animation, the most tedious and expensive kind of
filmmaking, has been predicted every few years. Until recently,
though, economics made animation features risky. But in their first
weekend ``The Land Before Time'' topped all releases with $7.5
million in 1,395 theaters ($5,395 average), and ``Oliver and
Company'' in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no. 4 with $4

   A freelance paleontologist was explaining
to a group of 7-year-olds what dinosaur bones looked like when he
stumbled on the real thing.
   The June 10 birthday party outing led by Peter Kranz to a housing
construction site resulted in the discovery of what may be the most
complete fossilized skeleton of the Dinosaur Age found in the
Washington, D.C., area in a century, said Nicholas Hotton, a
research curator of paleobiology at the Smithsonian Institution's
Museum of Natural History.
   Kranz said he was describing fossilized dinosaur bones to the
children when he found a chunk of dark carbon. Other fragments were
uncovered, then Kranz sent the young amateurs home and called the
Smithsonian.
   ``I was nervous about handling such a large specimen,'' Kranz
said. Hotton exposed more of the find and confirmed its significance.
   The find included a portion of the head and skeleton of a 20-foot
mosasaur, a large seagoing predatory lizard that thrived during the
Late Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago, said Hotton, who
has worked at the Smithsonian for 30 years, specializing in fossil
reptiles.
   For Kranz, the find is especially timely. His book, ``Dinosaurs
in Maryland,'' has just been published as part of an educational
series by the Maryland Geological Survey. Kranz teaches classes in
natural history for students from kindergarten to graduate school.

<HEAD>Rare Dinosaur's Bones Found in Northern Colorado</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fossil remains of a rare, meat-eating
dinosaur that predated the more famous Tyrannosaurus Rex but
rivaled it in size and ferocity have been discovered in Colorado, a
scientist said Wednesday.
   The dinosaur, named Epanterias amplexus, weighed about four tons
and measured about 50 feet long, and had a long, powerful tail that
probably allowed it to bounce along like a kangaroo, said
University of Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker.
   The Epanterias could eat about 40 tons of meat a year and its
``claws seem to be the longest and the strongest of any meat-eating
dinosaur that ever lived,'' he said.
   ``Because of its jaw structure, Epanterias could have swallowed
a 1,400-pound Hereford cow with no trouble,'' Bakker said.
   The first bones of the latest Epanterias site were found west of
Fort Collins in northern Colorado by a team headed by Bakker.
   Epanterias walked on its hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex, but
was built lower, or ``slinkier'' to the ground, Bakker said, adding
that T. Rex came along some 66 million years after Epanterias.
   So far the dig has recovered a jawbone, neck and tail vertebrae
and chest bones, he said.
   ``There's more still in the ground but it's the hardest dig I've
ever made, like digging porcelain imbedded in concrete,'' he said.
   The site is mountainous and a transitional zone between sage and
pine. When Epantarias roamed the region 135 million years ago at
the end of the Jurassic period, it was a vast flat floodplain
stretching east and west from Nevada to South Dakota and north and
south from Alberta, Candad, to New Mexico, Bakker said.
   The only other two known Epantarias sites were discovered in
1877 near Canon City, Colo., and in 1934 in the Oklahoma panhandle.
   Bakker hopes that by assembling bones from all three sites, a
nearly complete composite Epanterias can be assembled.
   ``Since these discoveries only seem to come along about every 50
years, we still have a lot to learn about Epanterias. Even though
this animal was as long as Tyrannosaurus Rex and heavier than the
average circus elephant, it's rarely mentioned in standard dinosaur
textbooks,'' Bakker said.

By Terry Rather, Times Staff Writer: Tom Demere loves uncovering mysteries from 
the past as a paleontologist for the San Diego Natural History Museum. The 
42-year-old Demere studies animal and plant fossils and has participated with 
fellow museum paleontologists in several excavations throughout the county, 
including a dig that uncovered the remains of a dinosaur in Carlsbad. A few 
months ago, the paleontologists discovered a 3-million-year-old toothed whale 
fossil in Chula Vista. Demere graduated from San Diego State, earned a master's 
degree in geology from the University of Southern California, and is working on 
a doctorate at UCLA. He spoke with Times Staff Writer Terry Rather and was 
photographed by Bruce K. Huff.

I guess you could say paleontology was something I came across in my 
undergraduate studies at SDSU. While searching for something I was interested 
in doing, I took classes where I studied the Earth and ecosystems. This led me 
to paleontology, which is a bridge between geology and biology. 
</P>
<P>
I have colleagues who grew up collecting shells and loving dinosaurs. As a kid, 
I spent a lot of time looking at natural settings. I was amazed by the changes 
in seasons and how flood waters can carry off sediment, rocks, houses, and so 
on. In my teens and early 20s, I did a lot of surfing, and that introduced me 
to the ocean and the dynamic nature of beach. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most dramatic setting is out in the desert; to be about 1,500 feet 
above sea level and look at remains that were deposited 7 million years ago of 
ancient sea creatures -- like clams, snails, sea urchins, whales and sharks -- 
and see how really dramatic the changes that have gone on are. I've been a 
paleontologist for 16 years and with the museum for 11 years. Prior to coming 
to the museum, I didn't participate in excavations, but since coming, we have 
done lots of excavations, all local and in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's vision of a paleontologist is that we're digging up dinosaurs. I've 
participated in plenty of excavations and found only one dinosaur, but it was 
exciting because it was a new kind of dinosaur for this area. About seven years 
ago we excavated a bone bed, which is a geologic layer that has a lot of bone 
in it, about a foot thick, in the Mission Hills area. We worked on that for 
about a month and a half, and we found a whole slew of bones of marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
What I enjoy most is the sense of discovery and digging into the past. I think 
every paleontologist has his own "wish list" of organisms he'd like to find. We 
have found bits and pieces of organisms that we'd like to find more of. Finding 
more would enable us to learn more, to unravel the evolution of this animal. 
The top of our wish list is the giant sea cow, which was probably 10 meters 
long. Over the years, we've found parts of this animal. It's always very 
exciting to uncover the remains of an organism no one has seen before and the 
fact that you can read about the past from the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
And the fossils, whether you are looking at ancient communities of herbivores 
or carnivores, bring to life how dynamic life is and how interesting and 
different and similar the processes are. 
</P>
<P>
Competition, life, death, have all been a part of life for hundreds of millions 
of years. The only change has been the players. You're able to look into the 
past and see how it relates to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Through paleontology you are able to time travel. One of the things I've tried 
to do at the museum is bring that sense of amazement to time travel to the 
general public through classes and, until recently, exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement of the kids who come to the museum is great. The youngest I 
remember had been a 3-year-old. He was so nuts on dinosaurs, he would just bowl 
you over on what he knew. He knew all the names and the stories the scientists 
have told about these animals. So to see his amazement at an actual dinosaur 
bone in the museum, when he actually got to hold the evidence of these stories, 
well, that's exciting. It's amazing how bright these kids are and how turned on 
they are to science. 
</P>
<P>
I really enjoy the people I meet and work with. It takes a certain personality 
to like to do tedious things, like crawling around on your hands and knees 
looking for remains of organisms.

   Scientists said today they have found embryo
skeletons from two kinds of dinosaurs in Montana, and that the
bones give further evidence that some dinosaurs may have tended
their young like birds.
   The discovery, some 60 miles southeast of Glacier National Park,
is reported in the British journal Nature.
   The animals lived some 75 million to 80 million years ago, John
R. Horner, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in
Bozeman, Mont., said in a telephone interview.
   Nineteen embryonic skeltons were found in a clutch of eggs laid
by a previously unnamed type of dinosaur, which Horner and David
Weishampel of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in
Baltimore propose calling Orodromeus makelai.
   That animal walked on its hind legs and grew perhaps eight feet
long. The embryos would be about eight or nine inches long when
stretched out, Horner said.
   Researchers also found parts of seven embryonic skeletons of the
duck-billed Maiasaura peeblesorum, which also walked walked on hind
legs and grew to be 30 feet long, he said. The embryos were about
one foot long, he said.
   Juvenile and adult specimens of each dinosaur were found with
the embryos.
   Horner said embryonic bones of the newly named dinosaur were
very well developed, while those of the duck-billed dinosaur had
not developed on the ends.
   That is consistent with the notion that hatchlings of the newly
named dinosaur could leave the nest soon after hatching, while
those of the other would have been bound to the nest, counting on
parents for care, Horner said.
   ``An animal that is nest-bound doesn't have to walk around''
right after birth, so its bones need not have developed as much by
that time, he said.
   Kevin Padian, associate professor of paleontology and biology at
the University of California, Berkeley, said the discovery was
``very important'' because few dinosaur embryos have been found.
   Last month, other researchers announced they had found a
dinosaur egg that may contain an embryo some 150 million years old.
Studies are continuing, but it does appear to contain an embryo,
said paleontologist Wade Miller of Brigham Young University in
Provo, Utah.

The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution by Dougal Dixon (Salem House: 
$19.95; 120 pages; illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen much discussion in scholarly and popular circles about 
what happened to the dinosaurs. After ruling the Earth for 150 million years, 
those spectacular reptiles suddenly became extinct 65 million years ago. 
Current speculation centers on some cataclysmic event, such as the Earth being 
hit by a comet, to explain their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dougal Dixon, a British paleontologist and science writer, wonders about a 
different question altogether. What if the comet had missed? he muses. What if 
the dinosaurs had not become extinct but had continued to flourish, evolve and 
dominate the planet? What would today's dinosaurs be like? 
</P>
<P>
The result of this speculation is an engaging, thoroughly enjoyable, 
almost-believable book, "The New Dinosaurs," which strictly applies the 
principles of evolution to the creation of an imaginary zoo. Starting with the 
idea that climate and environment are the deciding factors in how living things 
evolve, Dixon charts the changes on the Earth's surface since the dinosaurs 
died out and then invents critters to fill all environmental niches. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wonderful idea wonderfully carried out, and the pictures of these 
would-have-been creatures are as good as the text. 
</P>
<P>
Here we meet the balaclav (whose name is almost an anagram of a Greek pastry), 
a ferocious-looking beast that inhabits mountain snowfields and ekes out a 
living on alpine plants. To protect itself from the cold, the balaclav contains 
layers of fat and is covered by hair. 
</P>
<P>
The megalosaur, on the other hand, lives in tropical rain forests and offshore 
islands. "Its sharp teeth and the powerful claws on the forelimbs are used for 
holding prey and tearing it up," Dixon writes. "The actual killing is done with 
great talons on the hind feet. As it walks the heavy head is held out at the 
front, balanced by the long heavy tail behind."

The dingum, meanwhile, is a meat-eating desert creature with a remarkable 
anatomical trait. When a predator appears, "A fin of skin supported by struts 
of bone springs up from its curved back and presents a gaudily colored sail to 
the attacker, a sudden burst of garish color against the drab grasses. The 
crest on the back of the head pops up a frill of spines, each one poisonous 
enough to kill a large attacker."

Beast of the Steppes 
</P>
<P>
And don't overlook the taranter, a grass-eating beast of the steppes whose back 
is covered with horny bone plates. This armor originally evolved for defense, 
but in the taranter, it serves the more important purpose of helping the animal 
conserve moisture. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dixon's assumptions is that because the dinosaurs didn't die out, there 
was no evolution of mammals from the small, rat-like creatures they were during 
the Age of the Reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
All science-fiction movies to the contrary, cavemen did not exist at the time 
of the dinosaurs. They came much, much later, after the dinosaurs had 
relinquished the planet. In Dixon's imagined evolution, neither cavemen nor 
anything close to them ever got started. The highest mammal in Dixon's world is 
a zwim, which is about a foot long, looks like a cross between a shrew and a 
beaver, lives in streams and rivers and dines on insects. There are no primates 
in Dixon's hypothetical world, and certainly no humans. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any sign of intelligence, at least in our understanding of that 
term. The animals that Dixon envisions all live by instinct and evolutionary 
design. Might intelligence not have evolved in creatures other than humans? 
Just a thought. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alternative Zoology' 
</P>
<P>
"The New Dinosaurs" is Dixon's second book of "alternative zoology." The first 
was "After Man," which imagined how evolution was going to proceed in the 
future. "The New Dinosaurs" wonders how evolution would have occurred up to now 
with one large change along the way. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the books so compelling is that they are not mere flights of fancy 
cooked up in a dream. Starting with what is known about the dinosaurs that did 
exist and hewing to the rules of evolution, Dixon comes up with plausible 
creatures that might actually be roaming around today in place of you and me. 
It's a pleasant and provocative way to learn about dinosaurs and about 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for us, the comet (or whatever it was) didn't miss, the great 
reptiles did die out, the mammals did evolve, and here we are thinking about 
all these things. But it could have been otherwise.

<HEAD>China Finds Dinosaur Fossils, Among World's Largest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese and Canadian scientists have found what
they believe may be the largest dinosaur fossils in the world, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
   The discovery last month of the remains of a dinosaur believed
to have been 99 feet long was made in northwest China's Gobi desert
by members of the Sino-Canadian Dinosaur Project, the report said.
   The fossils, including a complete skull and 10 pieces of
cervical vertebrae, were found in the Junggar basin in the Xinjiang
Autonomous Region, it said.
   Chinese paleontologist Dong Zhiming said the remains date back
140 million years and are believed to be the largest found in Asia
and possibly the world.
   The fossils have been shipped to Beijing for laboratory
analysis, Xinhua said. The report did not say what kind of dinosaur
it was believed to be.
   The Dinosaur Project, begun in 1986, involves experts from the
two fossil-rich countries of Canada and China who have made three
large expeditions into the Gobi desert.
   Their dinosaur and other fossil discoveries, including 12 major
dinosaur skeletons, will be part of a traveling exhibit to 12
cities around the world scheduled for 1992.

<HEAD>Study Suggests `Greenhouse' Warming Of Atmosphere Killed Dinosaurs</HEAD>

   An asteroid collision with Earth may
have released enough gas to heat the planet 65 million years ago,
causing gradual extinction of dinosaurs and other species by
destroying their food, researchers say.
   The study drew guarded praise from a critic of the theory,
because the findings attempt to explain why only certain creatures
became extinct and why the extinctions were gradual, not sudden.
   The asteroid impact theory differs from ones in which scientists
said such a collision caused mass extinction by kicking up enough
dust to block sunlight, plunging the planet into a freezing
darkness that killed plants, a source of food.
   California Institute of Technology planetary scientist John
O'Keefe and geophysicist Thomas Ahrens reached their conclusion by
analyzing experiments in which Ahrens and geophysicist Manfred
Lange shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph.
   Based on the amount of carbon dioxide released by the shattered
rocks, the scientists calculated that a 6-mile-diameter asteroid
hitting limestone or other carbon-rich rocks on Earth would have
released enough carbon dioxide to increase the amount of the gas in
the atmosphere two to five times.
   Such an increase in the gas, which traps solar heat like glass
in a greenhouse, could have caused a ``greenhouse effect'' that
warmed the planet by 9 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit for 10,000 years
after the asteroid struck, Ahrens said Tuesday.
   ``The leafy plants which dinosaurs ate were selectively
destroyed'' by the heat while other plants survived, Ahrens said.
``So there was probably (increased) competition for available food,
and eventually food supplies declined to a point where different
species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct in a
less-than-sudden manner.''
   Fossils show dinosaurs and other creatures became extinct
gradually, while many species survived. Many biologists and
paleontologists argue the mass extinction 65 million years ago was
caused by gradual climate change, not an asteroid or other sudden
catastrophe.
   William Clemens, paleontology chairman at the University of
California, Berkeley, and a leading critic of asteroid theories,
said he was skeptical of the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory because the
dinosaurs started to die earlier than 65 million years ago.
   But he called their study ``clearly a positive step'' because it
is consistent with gradual, selective extinction.
   O'Keefe will present the study Thursday in Houston at the 19th
Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.
   Scientists debating the dinosaurs' extinction fall into two main
camps: those who blame gradual climate change and those who blame
catastrophe. Catastrophe theorists disagree on whether an asteroid
or gigantic volcanic eruption was to blame.
   Geophysicist Charles Officer of Dartmouth College said he
believes the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory does not have merit because
geologic evidence supports the theory that volcanoes spewed enough
ash skyward to block sunlight and cause mass extinction.
   Geochemist Frank Kyte, of the University of California, Los
Angeles, disagreed, saying the theory that the asteroid triggered
greenhouse warming of the atmosphere is probably sound.
   While other scientists previously suggested the greenhouse
effect caused the extinctions, they said the carbon dioxide was
generated by volcanoes, changes in ocean circulation, or acid rain
that dissolved carbon-rich rocks.
   It is important to learn what killed the dinosaurs because ``it
behooves us to find out if we're just sort of sitting here awaiting
another (asteroid) impact to seal our doom, or if some of the
things we're doing to the environment might ... lead to the
extinction of many species,'' Clemens said.
   Scientists believe rising levels of carbon dixoide and other
greenhouse gases will warm Earth 3 to 5 degrees by the year 2050,
possibly causing crop-threatening droughts and partly melting polar
ice caps to raise sea levels and threaten coastal cities.
   Ahrens said an asteroid impact not only may have triggered
greenhouse heating, but possibly caused chemical reactions that
formed intense acid rain, which either killed many creatures
directly or wiped out their food plants. Clemens, however, wondered
how birds and other surviving species could have hidden from the
corrosive downpour.
