   Lockheed Corp.'s prototype
of a 21st century fighter jet made its first flight Saturday in a
winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar Advanced
Tactical Fighter contract.
   The YF-22 was airborne just 18 minutes, taking off from Air
Force Plant 42 in Palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desert
flight test center.
   The flight was a milestone in a high-stakes contest between an
aerospace team headed by Lockheed and a team led by Northrop Corp.
for 1,250 ATF jets, to be built at a projected cost of $51 million
per plane.
   The winner must produce a jet that is highly maneuverable, uses
radar-evading stealth technology and can fly twice the speed of
sound for long periods of time. The Air Force wants 750 of the new
planes and the Navy needs 500.
   Pilot Dave Ferguson said the YF-22 flew as expected although the
flight was shortened by 42 minutes because of problems at ground
telemetry stations.
   The jet burned so much fuel while sitting on the runway waiting
for takeoff that there wasn't enough left for the scheduled
one-hour flight.
   ``It was a very easy airplane to fly,'' said Ferguson, adding,
``I would be happy to put fuel in it and fly it this afternoon.''
   The jet reached an altitude of 12,500 feet and a speed of about
280 mph. The two-tone gray jet with stubby wings and a V-shaped
tail touched down smoothly in a light rain.
   The YF-22 was built by Lockheed, General Dynamics Corp. and
Boeing Co. It was unveiled in Palmdale Aug. 29, two days after the
YF-23, built by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., made
its first flight.
   Lockheed Vice President Sherman Mullin, head of the YF-22
project, said he could not compare the two planes because he didn't
have enough information about the YF-23.
   Each team has spent about $600 million producing two prototype
jets each.
   ``It's obviously an extremely important program to us,'' said
Mullin. ``(But) it's not a program that's going to make or break
the Lockheed Corp.''
   Both planes are built of advanced composite materials. The
Lockheed aircraft has stubby wings. The Northrop fighter has a
longer, cigarlike fuselage and a wingspread that looks like a kite.
   ``This is a great day from a technological perspective,'' said
Gary L. Denman, who heads an Air Force research division. ``I can
assure you, what's out there in the airplane is the best in the
world.''
   Survival of the advanced fighter program was threatened by
Congress until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense contracts.
   If Northrop and McDonnell Douglas win the contract, the YF-23
would be built in California. The Lockheed-General Dynamics-Boeing
team plans to build YF-22s in Marietta, Ga., if it wins. The
selection is due in 1991.
   The $51 million cost of each jet is about twice that of the Air
Force's present top fighter, the F-15 Eagle.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two engineers, convinced that a Connecticut
inventor beat the Wright brothers into the air by more than two
years, have drawn up blueprints for an engine they believe is
almost identical to the ones that powered that first flight. The
next step, they hope, is to build working replicas of the engines
in an attempt to prove that Gustave Whitehead may have been cheated
out of his proper place in history.

   Speaking with the passion of a television
preacher, Wes Gordeuk got down on his knees and carefully unrolled
a sheaf of documents containing the long-lost secrets of an early
American inventor.
   When he had finished, Gordeuk leaned back and smiled.
   Spread across the carpet on his living room floor were the
blueprints for an engine that Gordeuk believes was used to power
the first airplane flight in the United States.
   ``There's a hell of a lot of detail here,'' he says.
   Gordeuk, an engineer and jet engine instructor at Pratt &amp;
Whitney, and Don Richardson, a former electrical engineering
professor from Stratford, spent more than two years investigating
the engine and drafting the blueprint. They are now putting the
finishing touches on the blueprint and some day hope to build
engines based on the plans.
   The two are part of a team attempting to prove that Gustave
Whitehead made the first powered airplane flight in history on Aug.
14, 1901, more than two years before the Wright brothers flew in
North Carolina. Whitehead allegedly soared 50 feet above the ground
for a distance of about a half-mile at Bridgeport.
   Whitehead apparently did nothing to record his flight for future
historians. There was mention of the flight in a local Bridgeport
newspaper a few days after it reportedly occurred, and the flight
also was mentioned in Scientific American magazine. But there were
no photographs, workbooks, or other ironclad documentation.
   Even the airplane and engines allegedly used didn't survive.
Whitehead enthusiasts say that is because, as a tinkerer, Whitehead
constantly disassembled his inventions and re-used parts for other
work.
   The state of Connecticut in 1964 recognized Whitehead as the
``Father of Connecticut Aviation.'' But claims that Whitehead was
the first in the nation to fly have been rejected by many,
including experts at the Smithsonian Institution.
   The Connecticut Legislature adopted a bill in 1986 asking the
Smithsonian to review the matter, but to no avail.
   Undaunted by the skeptics, the Whitehead Research Society has
been working to quiet the opposition. It is building a flying
replica of the plane Whitehead is believed to have flown 88 years
ago. The plane is known as No. 21, an odd-looking, single-wing
machine modeled after a flying fish.
   Three years ago, the group unveiled a full-scale model of No. 21
that was made of the same materials used by Whitehead _ silk,
bamboo and pine. The replica underwent successful tow tests and
tethered lift tests.
   Gordeuk prepared for the tedious work of reconstructing
blueprints for the engines by making two propellers. The
64-year-old Cromwell resident followed Whitehead's notes and
studied photographs of No. 21, then spent 13 months carving the two
6-foot spruce propellers that were finished in 1985.
   To draft the engine blueprints, Gordeuk and Robinson studied
photographs of the engines and reviewed descriptions by Whitehead's
former co-workers. In addition, they studied engineering handbooks
and hardware catalogs from the turn of the century to help with
their detective work.
   ``Knowing engines, you don't even have to see the whole picture,
because even just a part of a picture to an engineer will give the
whole thing away,'' he says.
   ``We found that the hardware available and used by Gustave
Whitehead in 1901 was exactly the same as it is today. The
standards have not changed.''
   Gordeuk had to go to such extremes because Whitehead left behind
no notes on his work. Some believe that his family discarded the
material many years ago. The scant documentation is one reason
Whitehead's accomplishments have been ignored by history.
   ``We've duplicated, we think, within 99 percent of the actual
engines,'' Gordeuk says. ``By no means was it easy.''
   The two engineers discovered that Whitehead built an external
combustion engine that was modeled after a steam engine. It was
fueled by acetylene gas, which at the turn of the century was
readily available and was considered as the fuel of the future.
Gasoline, at that time, was considered too dangerous a fuel to be
used in engines, Gordeuk says.
   Using acetylene, mixed with air, Whitehead developed a unique,
lightweight engine with tremendous power, Gordeuk says. The
double-acting, four-cylinder engines could produce about 10
horsepower a cylinder. Whitehead used one engine per propeller,
giving him more horsepower than the Wrights had on their first
airplane, Gordeuk says.
   ``He was able to take off after a run of 20 to 25 yards,''
Gordeuk says. ``Why was he able to do this? Simply because he had a
third engine driving the front wheels of the airplane.
   ``The first airplane built that could fly and did fly was able
to take off in any wind conditions or still air in the shortest run
that hasn't been duplicated until recent years. Whitehead was a
genius. He was not a liar.''
   Having developed blueprints for the engines, the Whitehead group
has now reached its next obstacle. Gordeuk said the group is in
need of a machine shop to manufacture the engine parts so that
replica engines can be built. The group has not yet found a machine
shop to help.
   ``We are at somewhat of a dead end now,'' Gordeuk says.
   But he is far from disheartened and he is certain that his
engine and No.21 will fly some day.
   ``We're good engineers,'' he says. ``We know it's going to fly.''
   The Smithsonian ignored the Connecticut Legislature's request
and has no plans to conduct hearings into the matter, says Peter
Jakab, the museum's curator of early aviation.
   ``The governor signed a piece of legislation asking us to
convene a public hearing,'' he says. ``It's just not appropriate
for us to participate in that way. We're not an arbitrative body.''
   The curator says the Wrights fully documented their flight and
research, while the case for Whitehead is based on speculation. As
a result, the development of the blueprints for the engines is
interesting, but not historically significant, he said.
   ``While they claim to have developed the engines,'' he says,
``it's impossible to tell.''

   The B-2 stealth bomber, unveiled last fall
after more than a decade of secret work, will not fly for the first
time before late spring or summer, the Air Force said Friday.
   Acknowledging recent reports that the schedule for the first
flight was in jeopardy, the service said that because of ``an
aggregation of minor system checkout problems, the B-2's first
flight is now expected to be in the late spring or early summer time
frame.''
   ``Routine systems checkout of the first B-2 Advanced Technology
Bomber is continuing ...,'' the Air Force added. ``After first
flight, the B-2 will undergo extensive testing at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.''
   When the Air Force made its first announcement last summer about
an unveiling for the unusual ``flying wing'' plane, it confidently
predicted the aircraft would be ready for its first flight in the
fall of 1988.
   The plane was ultimately shown to the public for the first time
Nov. 22 at an Air Force plant in Palmdale, Calif.
   Air Force and Pentagon officials said at the time they were not
going to rush the initial checkouts of the sophisticated flight
systems, but that they still expected the plane to fly before the
end of the year.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said Friday the
problems encountered by technicians all had been relatively minor,
but that it took time to prepare a plane for its first flight.
   ``We have said all along that we're going to fly this airplane
when it's ready, and not according to some calendar schedule,'' said
Mullaney.
   The spokesman added the Air Force decided to release Friday's
statement after encountering a problem with the bomber's
``environmental control,'' or air conditioning, system, within the
past week or so.
   A component of that system failed during a high-pressure test,
Mullaney said. Even though the system was purposely overloaded 50
percent beyond its design limit at the time, the Air Force decided
to fix the component to ensure an extra margin of safety.
   ``The fix for that is straightforward and corrective action is
underway,'' he said.
   The disclosure of checkout problems comes three months after the
Air Force announced the B-2 would carry a price tag _ including
research and development costs _ of $516 million per plane. That
will make it the most expensive airplane ever.
   According to the latest Air Force estimate, the design,
development and construction of 132 planes will cost $68.1 billion
by the time production ends in mid-1995. Even if research and
development expenses are excluded, each plane still will cost $305
million to produce on the assembly line.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be almost
invisible to enemy radar, due to the extensive use of exotic
composite materials, some of which absorb rather than reflect radar
waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a cross-section that
offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration
bomber, as opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate
enemy air defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.

<HEAD>Wright Brothers Sites to Get Federal Preservation Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will study sites
where the Wright brothers lived and worked in a move that could
lead to a national park in the birthplace of aviation, officials
said Friday.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said the National Park Service study,
expected to take 12 to 15 months, will help Congress decide whether
to confer national park status on the sites.
   A committee headed by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice was
formed to preserve the heritage of Orville and Wilbur Wright, who
developed the first heavier-than-air flying machine.
   ``Over the years ... we have lost many of the buildings, many of
the historic sites involved in the birth of aviation either to the
wrecking ball or to just plain indifference,'' Rice said. ``That
time is over.''
   The sites to be studied include Huffman Prairie, scene of the
Wright brothers' first flying experiments, and buildings that
housed the Wrights' airplane company, bicycle shop and printing
business.
   Also on the list are Hawthorne Hill, home of Orville Wright;
Carillon Park, home of the Wright Flyer III, known as the world's
first practical airplane; and Dunbar House, home of Paul Lawrence
Dunbar, poet and friend of the Wright brothers.
   William Gibson, a National Park Service official based in
Chillicothe, said the agency will study options for managing the
sites, including oversight by the state or local government, the
private sector, or the federal government in the form of a national
park.
   ``We are impressed,'' said Gibson. ``The historic resources
associated with the Wright brothers that remain in Dayton are truly
impressive.''
   The city of Dayton and Montgomery County plan to contribute
$35,000 apiece toward the study. Private contributions will also be
sought, officials said.
   While the Wright brothers constructed their early aircraft at
their bicycle shop in Dayton, they also are connected historically
with Kitty Hawk, N.C., where on Dec. 17, 1903, they made the first
controlled, sustained flights in a power-driven airplane.

REFLECTIONS: THE P-38 WAS THE HIGHEST SPOT OF MY WHOLE MILITARY CAREER.

Thomas G. McGuire, retired Valley College English teacher and competitive 
marksman, fell in love nearly 50 years ago. The object of his affection was a 
sleek new airplane built in Burbank. McGuire, 70, writes for "Lightning 
Strikes," the P-38 National Assn. newsletter. He lives in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I ever saw a P-38, some nut in San Francisco looped the Golden 
Gate Bridge. I thought, "Oh my God!" It was 1940. I just dreamed of that damned 
airplane all those years that I was flying other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I graduated as a pilot in December of 1943. I went down to Santa Ana on the old 
daylight train, 220 young guys. When the war was over, I think about 69 of them 
were still alive, out of 220. I was lucky, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to fly P-38s, but I was sent to instructor school. I taught advanced 
flying for all of 1944 and a little bit of '45. I never lost one student. I 
like to think it was because I was very careful with them that I never lost 
one. 
</P>
<P>
I first went to Pecos, Tex. At Pecos, there was a cadet killed every week or 
so. We killed 13 in one night. We killed more men in training in the States 
than we lost overseas. A new pilot would ask, "How many pine boxes are going 
out of here a week?" Those statistics have never been made available to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
We killed eight in one day at Chico. We killed nine in one day in Santa Rosa. 
My mother would phone the Red Cross from San Francisco because the paper would 
just say, "Midair collision in Santa Rosa, both pilots killed." I didn't know 
how hard it was on her. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to get out of the training command and into P-38s. Finally, I got my 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
The P-38 is a wonderful airplane, a twin-fuselage, single-seat fighter. The 
cockpit is between the two engines. It's got a lot of weight. It's got a lot of 
power. It had a nice, soft, sweet hum about it. It was the most incredible 
thing there was. The P-38 fought in every theater in World War II. It was the 
first American airplane of any type to fly over Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
No airplane ever had that many switches, lights and gadgets for one man to 
handle. It was harder to fly, more complicated. And it had the highest death 
rate in training and operation. 
</P>
<P>
In fighters, a solo flight is a very hairy thing, but especially in a P-38. I 
was really scared, too. You've got two engines pulling like hell. You have to 
lock your wheels, your legs jammed against the brake pedals, and you run it up 
to 3,000 r.p.m.s. I just let go of the brakes, poured the coal to it and got a 
shock from that slam back against the seat. I never felt that before. I had 
never been in anything that powerful. I came around and made a good landing, 
too. I got this funny feeling about that afterward, like, "Did I really do 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
I never went overseas. I flew P-38s out of Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa was a real 
fighting airport, with loaded guns in the planes, in defense of San Francisco. 
They were afraid the Jap submarines were going to come up and make a run over 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
When the war was over, I had the weird experience of ferrying beautiful 
brand-new P-38s from Lockheed to Kingman, Ariz., where they were just left to 
rot or to be chopped up. 
</P>
<P>
When I got out of the service, they offered to sell me a P-38 for $1,300. I 
didn't have the money then. I was going back to school, so I passed on that. 
Now one of those is worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
They made 10,000 of them, but only 13 are left. The P-38 Assn. is having this 
big blowup in January in Santa Maria. They'll have some P-38s flying, and you 
can walk up and look at them or climb up the ladder in back. 
</P>
<P>
The P-38 was the highest spot of my whole military career. It was the greatest 
thing that ever happened to me. No words can really tell what it was like to 
fly those things at maximum performance. It was a most amazing kind of thing. 
I've never used narcotics, but one of the guys who has, told me that going 450 
miles an hour at low altitude in a P-38 gives you a higher boost than any kind 
of drug.

<HEAD>`Flying Child' Returns To Launch New Kite Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 70-pound girl whose kite took her
on an unscheduled flight returned Saturday to her liftoff site and
managed to stay on the ground as she launched a new set of kite
safety rules.
   DeAndra Anrig's appearance ended a ban on kite flying at
Shoreline Park after the 8-year-old's kite string snagged on a
passing airplane March 20 and carried her 10 feet off the ground
for at least 100 feet.
   The third-grader from Dublin still has deep bruises on her back
but was so excited about Saturday's event that she couldn't sleep
Friday night, according to her mother, Debbie. She flew a stunt
kite for about a minute before it fell to the grass.
   ``It feels fun,'' DeAndra said shyly to a crowd of reporters,
who outnumbered other spectators. ``It was fun just to get the kite
up in the air and flying it.''
   She warned other children not to fly kites next to nearby Palo
Alto Airport, from which planes were taking off and landing over
the park.
   But, she added: ``I want to fly again even though I was hurt.''
   Glenn Lyles, the city's Shoreline manager, had said it was
appropriate to have DeAndra be the first to officially fly a kite
after the regulations were revised.
   Greeting her today with a pat on the head, he said with a laugh,
``You've caused me a lot of work the last month.''
   The story of DeAndra's flight was relayed around the world by
the news media, which dubbed her Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh and
the Flying Nun.
   The plane sustained minor damage in the runin with the kite, but
landed safely.
   The city's new guidelines for kite flying at the park, which is
located near both the airport and Moffett Field Naval Air Station,
include a ban on flying kites higher than 150 feet.
   The Federal Aviation Administration made no ruling as to who was
at fault in March when DeAndra was snagged by the airplane,
according to Lyles. The city's report indicates that the kite was
between 200 and 250 feet in the air, but the pilot who struck the
kite claimed to be at 700 feet, he said.

San Diego State University journalism professor January Riddle received her 
license to fly in 1983. Riddle, 46, mainly a recreational flier, had previously 
competed in only two small-scale races. But when the opportunity to fly in the 
Air Race Classic, the Super Bowl of women's aviation races, arose this summer, 
she teamed with experienced pilot Sally Bocinski. They borrowed a Cessna 172 
for the 2,600-mile, four-day journey that took the racers to obscure airports 
in New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois and West Virginia before ending in 
York, Pa. Riddle, a member of the 99's, an international organization for women 
pilots founded by Amelia Earhart, is now preparing for a 500-mile, one-day race 
later this month. Riddle spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather and was 
photographed by Bob Grieser. 
</P>
<P>
It was wonderful being with all those accomplished women pilots. The race was 
never scary but was very intense, more so than I thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
It's not like getting in a plane and leisurely going somewhere. Every minute 
you're concentrating on not getting off course, making sure the plane is flying 
at full capacity every single second, and watching the weather. It takes all of 
the skills that you ever learned and tests them every single moment. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the race was a thrill. It was a staggered start with airplanes 
taking off every 10 seconds. At the beginning of the race, no one talks to you. 
But, after you've flown, people say, "You're still here, you didn't flake out, 
you're still with us." Then you become part of the group. It's a special group, 
and it becomes an important part of your life. 
</P>
<P>
The airplane we had was one of the slowest allowed in the race, so we were 
actually in the air seven to eight hours a day. It took us three days to finish 
the race. So it was three days of getting up at 4:30 in the morning. That was 
the killer. We had to be able to take off at the first possible minute because 
our airplane was so slow, and we had to land by sunset. 
</P>
<P>
I had never flown east of Arizona or north of Oregon, so I had a very small 
scope of what flying is like. There were 48 other planes, and no one had to fly 
at a certain altitude. You just watched what you're doing because it's up to 
you. It always is. The ultimate responsibility is with the pilot in all 
situations. But these races are surprisingly safe. The record for women's air 
races is very good. There were no crashes or injuries in this race, even though 
the possibility and potential was there. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing the race was an incredible experience. It was very challenging and 
very rewarding. The only thing I can compare winning that race to would be like 
getting an Oscar. It is the absolute, the ultimate, to say you won that race in 
that kind of competition. We finished 33rd, which is reputable. We were happy 
we did that well. 
</P>
<P>
Flying feels so free, so liberating. You're totally self-sufficient, really 
relying on you and your machine. I feel so fortunate to be able to do this. 
</P>
<P>
When I first started flying, I took a lot of kidding from the guys. There 
weren't a lot of women at that time taking lessons at that club. A lot of women 
who learn to fly do it because their boyfriends or husbands fly, not because 
they want to. There's a difference. That made me a little unique, because I 
wanted to fly. 
</P>
<P>
I always wanted to fly, but there was always something, like college or the job 
or husband and kids. Women tend to do that, put off their own dreams in favor 
of others. I found myself looking at my 40th birthday, so I decided now it's my 
turn, now I'm going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Flying is really great. When I get a little crabby, my friends ask me how long 
it's been since I've flown. "You haven't flown in a while, have you?" My 
friends can tell when I haven't flown. 
</P>
<P>
It's an addiction. Anything that makes you feel so good makes you want to keep 
doing it. I'm amazed that people can learn to fly and not keep doing it. I 
can't even imagine that. It would be so painful to not be able to do that 
anymore. Flying adds an entire new dimension to your life.

<HEAD>Creator Of Sopwith Camel Dead At 101</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith, the
adventure-loving creator of the famed World War I Sopwith Camel and
Pup airplanes, died today, his son said. He was 101.
   Sopwith, who taught himself to fly in 1910 and began designing
airplanes at age 26, died before dawn at his 19th century manor home
near Winchester in southern England, his son Thomas said.
   ``Really he died of old age, but he'd had a marvelous (life),''
said Thomas Sopwith, 56, from his office in Brighton.
   The elder Sopwith, an accomplished race car driver and yachtsman
before he discovered his passion for airplanes, set several early
flying records.
   ``We had a lot of crashes in those days, but, bless you, it was
fun,'' he recalled on his 100th birthday last year. ``This new
experience of flying was one of the most exhilarating things that
had ever happened to me.''
   Sir John Lidbury, a former director of Sopwith's Hawker Siddeley
aircraft company, said: ``He was a wonderful engineer, with great
technical ability and flair ... Everything he put his hand to he did
thoroughly and well.''
   More than 16,000 Sopwith airplanes were built for action in World
War I, including 6,000 Camels, which shot down more enemy aircraft
than any other allied plane. A Camel flown by Roy Brown shot down
the German Baron Von Richthofen, the infamous ``Red Baron.''
   Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, born in 1888 into a wealthy
engineering family, was 16 when the Wright brothers flew under power
for the first time in the United States.
   Sopwith loved all racing, and became involved with motorcycles,
motorboats, ballooning and sailing before taking up flying in 1910.
   He bought his first airplane for 630 pounds (then worth $3,000),
and after two flights as a passenger, he taught himself to fly. His
first solo flight ended in a crash, but he wasn't injured.
   Sopwith founded Sopwith Aviation Co. in 1912 and gave up piloting
for design two years later. His company created the Snipe, the Pup
and the Camel.
   Jack Bruce, an aviation historian, said some pilots grew to love
the Camel, which he called a ``neurotically responsive machine,''
but only after they had spent time with it.
   ``(It was) difficult to learn how to handle but once pilots had
got the hang of it, (it was) quite exceptionally maneuverable,'' he
told the Daily Telegraph last year. ``But a lot of pilots were
petrified at the thought of it.''
   Sopwith's second company, founded between the wars, took the name
of his test pilot Harry Hawker who died in 1921.
   In 1936, Sopwith gambled by building 1,000 of his Hurricane
airplanes without an advance order from the government, but the
plane later became the backbone of the Royal Air Force when World
War II broke out.
   He retired as chairman of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1963.
   Sopwith was married twice, and both his wives are deceased.
   He is survived by his son.

   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- A version of the Air
Force's next-generation fighter jet, built by Northrop Corp.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp., took to the skies for the first
time yesterday, setting the stage for a showdown with another
version of the aircraft built by a rival team of aerospace
companies.
   The twin-engine YF-23, with a Northrop test pilot, Paul
Metz, at the controls, climbed to 25,000 feet, and functional
checks of basic subsystems were performed during the
early-morning, 50-minute flight. United Technologies Corp.'s
Pratt &amp; Whitney division made the engines on the YF-23.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The airplane flies very clean, much cleaner than we
expected," Mr. Metz said. "During the climb-out, I was using
considerably less power than I expected, and the chase
airplanes were on afterburners just to stay with me -- with
my landing gear down."
   The other team, composed of Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and
General Dynamics Corp., is scheduled to roll out its Advanced
Tactical Fighter, the YF-22, tomorrow at a Lockheed site in
Palmdale, Calif. The first flight of that plane is expected
to be next month.
   The Air Force, which wants 750 of the jets to replace the
aging F-15 fighter, is scheduled to choose the winning team
in April and award the full-scale development contract three
months later. A second YF-23, which was delivered to a test
facility here in June, will fly with General Electric Co.
engines.

   Folks around Fairgrounds Park who
thought they saw a lawn mower flying overhead weren't hallucinating.
   Not only did Clarksville inventor Freddie Roberts fly the remote
control lawn mower for several minutes in the park, he even made it
fly loops, turns and upside-down.
   ``I made it for fun and to silence a few critics who think I'm
crazy, including my wife,'' Roberts, 44, said Monday.
   ``Who says a lawn mower can't fly? This one can fly but it can't
cut grass ... unless we have a crash landing.''
   The flying mower, made of balsa wood and Styrofoam, weighs less
than 5 pounds and is equipped with a model airplane engine. It is
guided by a model-airplane radio remote control.
   Roberts, a model airplane enthusiast for 30 years, also flies
gyrocopters, ultra-lights and is getting his pilot's license.
   ``I plan to build a (remote control) flying Santa Claus and
sleigh with reindeer for Christmas,'' he said.

<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Alfred Wilhelm traveled from Germany
to Oshkosh in search of his roots, he never expected to hit paydirt
in a cemetery by meeting one of his living relatives there.
   The 38-year-old Bavarian was diligently copying birth and death
dates from headstones in the Riverside Cemetery last year when
Wilhelm Mauritz walked by.
   Mauritz, 84, was born in a farmhouse near the German-Austrian
border in 1904. His father, Joseph, wrote to three uncles living in
Oshkosh and asked them to sponsor their voyage to America. They
complied, and the Mauritz family came to America in 1905 on the
steamship Pennsylvania.
   But Mauritz's father did not forget his German relatives,
keeping in touch with them through letters and photographs. The
letters and photographs came back to his son via Wilhelm.
   The two first met last year when Mauritz struck up a
conversation with Wilhelm at the cemetery. Wilhelm explained he was
from Munich, researching his family history and then brought out a
photograph _ a copy of the same picture Mauritz had at home.
   The woman in the photograph was Katharina Drachsler, Wilhelm's
great-great-grandmother. She was also a great-aunt to Mauritz'
first wife, Rosa.
   ``That took me by surprise when he took that picture out and
says, `Where is this lady buried?''' Mauritz recalled.
   Wilhelm, who is on a second visit here, said he started tracing
his family history 10 years ago. ``My grandpa also searched for
family and I followed him,'' he said.

<TEXT>     Now, 42 years later, the experiment appears to be a success. Hal Wright is
still in business with his unique Sierra Booster.;   "It's hard work, but I
guess we've proved it can be done," said Wright one recent afternoon in his
office a half block off Loyalton's main drag.;   "We just figured we'd do it
our own way and see if it wouldn't work," said Wright, who left a factory job
in the Bay Area to try journalism."It looked like a good way to get out of the
city, earn a living for ourselves in the mountains.";   For the paper's first
30 years or so, all the type was set by Wright's wife, Allene, on an electric
typewriter. Each line had to be typed twice to determine the spacing between
letters and words to make all the lines the same length.;   In recent times, a
desk-top computer has eased that chore. Otherwise, the paper is largely
unchanged and it has never missed its two-week publishing cycle.;   "I
remember one time, though, in that heavy winter of 1952, when I had to ski
over Yuba Pass to get the paper to the printers. I'd never been on skis
before. Took me 2 1/2 days to make it," Wright recalled.;   It was the next
year, he said, when he decided the Booster should own an airplane. He bought a
1948 Aeronca Sedan, took flying lessons, and began delivering the paper by
airplane on occasion.;   ". . . When I have time I like to take off and fly
around the valley here, see how many papers I can get on porches, throwing
them from the plane," he said.;   Flying in the remote area is fun, he said,
especially when the snow is heavy enough to use skis. "Then you can land and
take off anywhere.";   It is adventurous, too. Once his engine failed and he
made it to the airport with only enough altitude to clear the fence at the end
of the runway by barely a foot.;   Wright, a youthful 87, continues to fly and
belongs to the UFOs -- United Flying Octogenarians, a 97-member international
organization of licensed pilots in their 80s.;   He said he has slowed down in
recent years. For the past 10 years, daughter Jan Buck has taken over more and
more of the paper's chores from her parents. And three heart operations this
year caused Wright to lose 15 pounds.  </TEXT>

   The first ``stealth'' test of Northrop's
flying-wing jet bomber was a remarkable success. Trouble was, four
decades ago, nobody much cared.
   Shortly before the Air Force canceled its order for the strange
YB-49, the late 1940s forerunner to the B-2, Northrop test pilot Max
Skelton flew a grand tour of air defense stations in the West.
   ``Nobody found him _ until he was directly overhead,'' says
flying-wing historian Tim Wooldridge of the National Air and Space
Museum. ``So even then, the Air Force knew that that kind of
airplane was difficult to detect. The sad part is that they didn't
continue the testing.''
   Eventually, the lesson began to take hold, though the Air Force
still wouldn't bring itself to embrace the flying-wing design for
decades. Speed and manueverability remained paramount objectives
through the 1950s and '60s, though stealthiness gradually moved
higher on the priority list.
   Despite representations of the B-2 and its fighter counterpart,
the F-117A, as the only stealth aircraft in the world, the
anti-radar technology has been honed and shared by many other planes
in the U.S. arsenal, some of which remain even more secret than the
B-2 itself. The aging U-2 spy plane and its successor, the SR-71
Blackbird, featured composite coatings. The B-1 and the F-117A
represent advances in wing and body blending as well as the
radar-absorbent materials on their skins.
   Contrary to popular belief, the marriage of stealth technology
with the flying wing, with its slender and hence naturally stealthy
profile, also goes back decades, dating almost to the birth of radar.
   Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the British radar pioneer, said as early
as 1935 that the aerial defense applications of his new technology
could be stymied by future bombers designed to reduce their radar
reflectivity. He and other engineers recognized that stealth would
have not so much to do with the size of the airplane, but with its
shape and the materials used to cover it.
   In World War II, as the United States and Great Britain
aggressively improved radar technology, German scientists led the
way in exploring methods to counter it _ including coatings designed
to absorb, rather than reflect, radar energy. These radar-absorbent
materials, or RAM for short, were first used to shield the snorkels
of German submarines from detection by radar-equipped aircraft. Too
late, really, the engineers turned their attention to their own
aircraft.
   Almost by happenstance, Britain had already delivered a painful
lesson to the Third Reich about bombers and stealth technology.
Early in the war, the tiny de Havilland Company had answered the
panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a
cheap, two-engine machine out of plywood, spruce and balsa. It was
initially scoffed at, but the Mosquito, which carried nary a
defensive gun, had the lowest loss rate of any World War II bomber
thanks to its speed, flying altitude and the nearly invisible
flicker it produced on radar screens.
   That lesson in mind, the brothers Walter and Reimar Horten,
working with a super-secret Luftwaffe group known as Sonderkommando
9, set out to build a super-Mosquito, one even stranger in design.
They came up with a flying wing, powered by two jet engines buried
behind the cockpit. But too late: The HoIX, the only prototype to
fly, in early 1945, was destroyed when one of the engines failed; a
never-flown copy rests at the National Air and Space Museum's
storage complex at Silver Hill, Md.
   ``It is a remarkably clean-looking airplane,'' says Wooldridge, a
museum official and the author of ``Winged Wonders: The Story of
Flying Wings.''
   The test models were covered with plywood, but production
versions were to have a skin mixing plywood, sawdust, charcoal and
glue _ a compound expressly intended to absorb radar waves. The
Hortens had built a high-load-bearing plane combining jet power, the
low-profile shape of the flying wing and integral RAM. It was the
B-2 of its day.
   More frightening to contemplate is how the war might have turned
if Germany had managed to deploy a larger model that the Hortens had
actually started to assemble in April 1945, the HoXVIII. It was an
enormous, six-jet flying-wing bomber, designed to fly at least 7,400
miles with an 8,000-pound bombload. Were it not for Hitler's
imminent defeat, that aircraft, rivaling the size of the B-2, might
have flown to bomb New York City or Washington.
   Unlike Germany's rocket scientists, the Horten brothers were
rebuffed in their bid to pursue their breakthroughs for the Allies
after the war. Most U.S. warplane manufacturers focused on the
obvious alternatives to stealth for making their craft less
vulnerable _ more speed, higher altitudes, heavier armor and
on-board defenses.
   Meanwhile, Jack Northrop, the founder and longtime design leader
of the California company that bears his name, waged a lonely
campaign for something entirely different _ though the Horten
brothers, headed for virtual exile in Argentina, would not have
thought it so.

   The Air Force unveiled its
sinister-looking B-2 stealth bomber Tuesday, giving the world its
first look at the gray-and-black flying wing designed to evade enemy
radar and deliver nuclear weapons.
   The bomber, which has never been flown, was towed slowly out of a
hangar at Air Force Plant 42 in the Mojave Desert to cheers from an
invitation-only crowd of 2,000 workers, military brass, media and
industry representatives.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The rollout ceremony, conducted before a giant American flag, was
in part a celebration of U.S. industrial ingenuity and in part, a
bit of high-tech saber rattling.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force's chief of staff, said the
plane's declared ability to slip through radar at all altitudes to
deliver its payload of nuclear bombs represents a potent deterrent
to those who would attack the United States.
   ``Its stealth capability will permit it to penetrate the most
sophisticated air defenses and survive well into the 21st century,''
Welch said. ``The B-2 is a superb example of the inherent
technological advantage of free society.''
   The rollout followed by three weeks the Pentagon's release of a
photo of another closely guarded project, Lockheed Corp.'s stealth
fighter, the F-117A. That plane has been flying since 1981 and was
declared ready for wartime missions in 1983; its existence was
acknowledged because the Air Force was preparing to start its first
daylight flights.
   Nearly everything surrounding the stealth bomber is secret,
including the cost.
   The General Accounting Office estimates the fleet of 132 stealth
bombers the Air Force wants to assemble over the next several years
could cost taxpayers $68 billion. That would put them at more than
$500 million a copy.
   The Air Force puts the total cost of the program at $30 billion
to $40 billion.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar, due to the extensive
use of exotic composite materials, some of which absorb rather than
reflect radar waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a
cross-section that offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 displayed Tuesday was gray on top and black
beneath.
   Nobody was allowed to see the B-2 from the rear, presumably
because revealing the design of its engine exhaust system might help
enemy detection efforts.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge Jr. told the
gathering the program's expense represents an investment in safety.
   ``Let all of us remember America's enduring hope and prayer that
the B-2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent
aircraft will never be flown in anger,'' Aldridge said.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones saluted employees of his
company and of subcontractors who have worked on the project for a
decade, unable to describe their work.
   ``For years, they've been working in a kind of honorable exile,''
Jones said. ``They persevered, and now you can see what it's all
been about.''
   The first flight on most airplanes is six to 12 weeks after
rollout, but Air Force officials refuse to commit to a date for the
first flight of the B-2.
   One of the U.S. senators at the ceremony, Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
said budget contraints could force a ``stretch out' of stealth
bomber production, although he noted that influential Democrats like
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., give the program bipartisan backing.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said: ``Here, today, with the unveiling
of the stealth bomber, I have never felt better about the deterrence
of America. I think we've got a great airplane.''
   ``It has the potential to render obsolescent a very great
investment in Soviet air defenses,'' Wilson said.
   As the bomber was towed out of a massive hanger, an Air Force
band broke into the stirring ``Stealth Fanfare,'' composed for the
occasion by Tech. Sgt. Allen Yankee, 35, of McMinnville, Ore., a
saxophonist in the band.
   The B-2 project was launched by former President Jimmy Carter.
Critics, including the private Union of Concerned Scientists, say
the B-2 deployment, planned for the early 1990s, would hamper arms
control efforts by posing a greater threat than current planes to
enemy command posts and mobile missiles.
   The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration bomber, as
opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate enemy air
defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52 it is designed to replace.
   Flight tests will begin _ probably early next year _ at Edwards
Air Force Base, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave
Desert. The Air Force said the maiden flight will be the short hop
from the plant at Palmdale to Edwards.
   The bomber, which has inspired intense curiosity among aviation
buffs, has already inspired models, and a mockup appears in a
current automobile commercial.

   The Australian airline Qantas has ordered two
Boeing 747-400s and one 767-300 with extended range capability,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Thursday.
   The planes will be delivered between September and December 1989
and will cost about $380 million, including spare parts and
support, Boeing said in a news release.
   Qantas Chairman J.B. Leslie said the new planes, which will give
Qantas a 43-plane fleet, will serve the growing tourist market to
Australia. The airplanes will be financed by Qantas' foreign
exchange earnings and by overseas borrowings, he said.
   The order gives Qantas six of the advanced-technology 747-400s,
the world's largest commercial jetliner, and five extended-range
767-300s.
   The four-engine 747-400, which made its first flight this
spring, can carry up to 660 passengers. With a more typical
configuration for 412 in two classes, the plane can fly more than
7,300 nautical miles, or from San Francisco to Melbourne.
   The twin-engine 767-300 is capable of hauling up to 375
passengers, but can fly more than 7,000 miles with 210 aboard.
   So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 401 jetliners worth
$18.2 billion, compared with 366 jets worth a record $19.9 billion
in 1987.
   Boeing now has 148 orders for 747-400s and 103 orders for
767-300s.

   Lockheed Unveils a Prototype YF-22,
   Its Competitor to Replace F-15 Fighter

   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. and two other defense
contractors displayed a prototype of their candidate in the
competition to build the Air Force's next-generation fighter
jet.
   The winner of the contest between two proposed versions of
the so-called Advanced Tactical Fighter, or ATF, eventually
would replace the aging F-15s that have been pressed into
service in the Middle East.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first YF-22, as the new Lockheed plane is known,
wouldn't be available for use by the military until the
beginning of the next decade. By that time, both company and
Pentagon officials stress, the F-15 will be nearly 30 years
old, and many Third World nations are expected to have added
to their arsenals today's top-of-the-line Soviet fighters,
the MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker. Already, 11 countries
possess the former.
   The YF-22, which Lockheed is manufacturing with Boeing Co.
and General Dynamics Corp., is competing with a YF-23 built
by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The Northrop
plane made a 50-minute maiden flight earlier this week,
climbing to 25,000 feet and flying at 333 miles an hour.
   "As current events demonstrate, there are those in the
world willing to test American resolve and readiness," said
Gen. Ronald Yates, who runs the Air Force Systems Command.
"That, in a broad sense, is why we need the ATF."
   In an interview, YF-22 program chief Sherman Mullin said
the fighter is tentatively set to make its first flight on
Sept. 14, but Air Force officials insisted yesterday that
they didn't want to be pinned down on an exact date. Lockheed
Chairman Daniel Tellep reiterated the company's strongly held
view that the victor on the ATF won't be "he who flies first,
but he who flies best."
   The ATF, through a unique combination of speed, agility,
range and stealthiness, is designed to take and maintain
control over enemy airspace, providing ground troops and
ships with safe room to maneuver in battle. "It will preserve
our security well into the next century," Gen. Yates
asserted.
   But, in the eyes of many lawmakers, the federal budget
deficit remains as much of a threat as potential Third World
aggressors. And at a projected $51 million per aircraft -- a
40% higher price tag than that carried by the most advanced
model of the F-15 -- it's doubtful to many that the Pentagon
will ever be authorized to buy all of the 750 ATFs that it
now says it needs. The Navy also wants its own variant of the
ATF, and currently has plans to procure 546 of them to
replace the F-14.
   The YF-22, which was presented while Wagner's "Ride of the
Valkyries" blared over a speaker system, in some respects
resembles Lockheed's F-117 Stealth fighter, with its angular
airframe. In fact, Mr. Mullin called it "loosely speaking,
the son of the F-117." With four tails and stubby wings, the
aircraft also has a far different appearance from the rival
YF-23. It is shorter than the Northrop plane, which features
a more cigar-shaped fuselage: 64 feet, 2 inches, vs. 67 feet,
four inches.
   The stakes are high for all the companies involved,
including engine makers General Electric Co. and United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, with this being
seen as the Defense Department's last major airplane project
of the century that is still up for grabs. "You don't have to
be a Rhodes Scholar to see that the military-aircraft
business is compressing," Mr. Mullin said. "The loser is
going to be hit very hard."
   Still, Mr. Mullin said that even with expected cuts and
stretch-outs in the defense budget, Lockheed can foresee the
ATF generating as much as $100 billion in revenue for its
team over the years between the Air Force and Navy
requirements. "Admittedly, there is no guarantee that is
going to happen," Mr. Mullin said. "But we just can't
envision the production of 1970-era airplanes in the year
2000."
   Collectively, the industry has sunk more than $1.3 billion
into the 54-month demonstration-and-validation phase of the
ATF program, meaning that even if Mr. Mullin's rosy
assessment is correct, it would take about 10 years for the
winners just to recover their investment. Major
subcontractors on the project have contributed another $800
million or so.
   The ATF "would be a nice piece of business for us," said
William Anders, vice chairman at General Dynamics. B. Daniel
Pinick, president of Boeing's defense and space group, said
that for his company, the YF-22 "meets one of our long-term
objectives: to be a maker of tactical aircraft."
   "The reason for that is simple," he added. "If you look at
where defense dollars around the world are going, it is into
these types of planes."
   But the success of the YF-22 is clearly most important for
Lockheed. Although Mr. Tellep asserted that winning the ATF
is "not make it or break it for Lockheed aircraft
activities," the company's historic role as a major supplier
of U.S. warplanes would almost surely be threatened by a loss
of this business. Although the YF-22 roll-out ceremony at
Lockheed's factory here was at times drowned out by riveting
on P-3 aircraft, most of the company's major lines have wound
down or are slated to do so soon. In addition, the Navy
recently terminated the company's contract to build the
successor to the P-3, the P-7.

JOURNEY OVER, SOLAR PLANE TAKES ITS PLACE IN THE SUN

<P>
A Riverside County man concluded history's first coast-to-coast flight in a 
solar-powered airplane here Tuesday, abandoning plans to fly nine more miles to 
his original destination because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Raymond, 33, said winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. persuaded him to scrub the 
last leg of his journey and instead take his plane by trailer to historic Kill 
Devil Hills, the sand dunes near Kitty Hawk where Orville and Wilbur Wright 
pioneered engine-powered aviation 87 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I landed basically at the beach yesterday," Raymond said Tuesday, one month 
and two days after his transcontinental trek began in the California desert. 
"With the forecast for winds and storms, it doesn't look like it is worth 
flying the last nine miles." 
</P>
<P>
Including Monday's 32-mile flight to Spot, where a storm forced him to land on 
a farmer's turf field, Raymond logged 2,467 miles during 119 hours and 23 
minutes in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those unofficial figures easily make Raymond -- a national hang-gliding 
champion from Lake Elsinore -- a world record holder in solar-powered aviation. 
The longest previous flight -- in a craft designed by Paul MacCready of 
Pasadena -- was across the English Channel in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, a lithe, bespectacled fellow, said he is not interested in records or 
recognition. He said his mission was to enlighten people about the potential of 
traveling with the help of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Solar is already quite practical for sporting aircraft," said Raymond, who 
built his 195-pound plane called Sun-Seeker, which resembles a giant dragonfly, 
in his garage. "Eventually, if the technology keeps improving . . . you will 
start seeing bigger and bigger and faster airplanes that are solar-powered." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of tourists, reporters and local aviators gathered at historic Kill 
Devil Hills on Monday and Tuesday, anticipating the pilot's arrival. Some were 
disappointed when they learned Sun-Seeker would not be landing amid the 
rippling sea oats surrounding First Flight Airport, but most seemed impressed 
by Raymond's feat. 
</P>
<P>
"What Eric has done is an example of creative engineering," said Gene 
O'Bleness, executive director of the First Flight Society, a group of pilots 
and aviation history buffs. His group, along with the Kitty Hawk Kites, held a 
cake-and-champagne reception for Raymond on Tuesday night and presented him 
with a leather bomber jacket with "Sun-Seeker" embroidered on the back. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's journey began in the desert east of Palm Springs on July 16. Two days 
later, Sun-Seeker -- which uses solar cells to power an electric motor used 
during takeoffs and landings -- was damaged in Lordsburg, N.M., forcing the 
crew to return to Lake Elsinore for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The flight recommenced Aug. 2, and Raymond hoped to reach Kitty Hawk in 10 
days. Poor flying conditions -- ranging from thunderstorms to head winds that 
at times blew the feather-light craft backward -- slowed the pilot's progress. 
The plane was grounded by foul weather on 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the thrill of the journey, with its potpourri of sights and encounters, 
overshadowed frustrations caused by the sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to fly across the country," Raymond said, recalling how the panorama 
changed gradually from desert to woods to farmland and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to avoid big cities with crowded skies, Raymond plotted a southerly 
course that took him through some of America's most lonely reaches. Among the 
crew's nighttime stopovers were such places as Cornudas, Tex., Chanute, Kan., 
Sedalia, Mo., and West Liberty, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The townsfolk and airport operators, Raymond said, were wonderfully hospitable. 
In Littlefield, Tex., the ground crew following Raymond accidentally wrecked 
the trailer needed to haul Sun-Seeker back to California. The local Chamber of 
Commerce president sent a team of mechanics to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking, 'Oh boy, what is this going to cost?' " recalled Raymond's 
wife, Aida, who followed her husband across the country in a chase plane. The 
local official, a glider pilot, refused to accept any money for the work. 
</P>
<P>
After resuming the trip, stiff winds and weak thermals -- the updrafts of warm 
air that lift Sun-Seeker to soaring altitude -- forced back-to-back landings in 
grassy fields in Missouri. The plane, made mostly of carbon fiber, suffered 
only minor damage to one wing that struck a bush. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond spent the long hours in his tiny cockpit -- which measures only 21 
inches wide -- reading maps, lunching on the fruit and cookies his wife packed 
each day and maneuvering his craft in the wind. The only discomfort was the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an air vent, but I close it when I'm trying to make the most distance," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A sportsman at heart, Raymond took advantage of the fierce winds Tuesday and 
went sail boarding. After returning home, he plans to start on his next 
project: a solar-powered dirigible capable of flying around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Warren reported from Riverside and Stanley reported from North Carolina.

   The first non-experimental aircraft that
flies both like a helicopter and an airplane rolled into the
spotlight Monday, hailed as an aviation milestone by legislators
and top military brass.
   The V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and hovers
like a helicopter and flies like an airplane, received a standing
ovation from a crowd of 1,600. The crowd watched as the camouflaged
craft was towed onto the tarmac at Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.'s
Flight Research Center.
   The first flight of the V-22, which has been in development for
30 years, is scheduled for Aug. 15. An advanced experimental model,
the XV-15, has been flying since 1977.
   Fort Worth-based Bell and Boeing Helicopter Co. of Philadelphia
are jointly developing the V-22 for the Navy, Marines and Air
Force. The three services plan to buy 682 of the twin-engine
aircraft at an estimated cost of $16.6 million each.
   ``It's kind of awesome,'' Marine Corps Commandant Alfred M. Gray
Jr. told the crowd.
   ``It works, it's ahead of schedule and will be a sound
investment for taxpayers' money,'' said Navy Secretary William L.
Ball III, comparing the tilt-rotor's production to the jet engine's
development as aviation milestones.
   ``You are proving every day that a great country can still
outthink, out-design and out-produce all comers,'' Ball said.
   The three military services plan to use the V-22 for combat
assault, search and rescue, medical evacuation and special-forces
missions. Other uses, including anti-submarine warfare, also are
being studied. The cabin can carry 24 combat-equipped troops in
addition to a crew of three.
   ``On our abortive rescue attempt made in Iran a few years ago,
think what could have happened if they'd had an Osprey,'' said
House Speaker Jim Wright, referring to the failed 1980 rescue of 44
American hostages from Tehran.
   The Osprey, about the size of a medium transport aircraft, has a
stocky 57.3-foot-long fuselage and twin engines mounted on thick,
stubby wings. Its engines point upward during takeoff and landing,
with 38-foot diameter rotor blades that parallel the ground.
   The engines rotate, or ``tilt,'' forward once the V-22 is
airborne. Rotors lock into place and act like oversized propellers,
pulling the Osprey through the air like a conventional aircraft.
   The tilt-rotor can fly with the speed and range of a turboprop
plane _ more than 360 mph _ but doesn't require an airport or
runway. It also can hover like a helicopter.
   ``I'm convinced that in the next 20 years there will be
thousands of these in use,'' said Bell President L.M. ``Jack''
Horner.
   Bell has talked with American Airlines and several commuter
companies about civilian uses for the craft, a spokesman said.
   ``The New York (and New Jersey) Port Authority is a strong
supporter of this concept,'' said Horner. ``We could build a lot of
V-22s for the cost of one airport.
   The British-designed Harrier jump-jet also takes off and lands
vertically, but using jet-propulsion rather than a rotor system.

The Air Force's SR-71 Blackbird spy plane smashed a transcontinental speed 
record today as it flew into retirement and the history books. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's fastest operational airplane took off from Edwards Air Force Base 
in California at 4:30 a.m., refueled offshore, flew back over Edwards and then 
shot off eastward at supersonic speeds that triggered a 6:01 a.m. sonic boom. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-to-Washington flight was 1 hour, 8 minutes and 17 seconds, said 
the Smithsonian Institution, which will keep the plane in the National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to its retirement home at the museum, the airplane broke four flight 
time records, including the world record of 4 hours, 12 minutes and 10 seconds 
for a flight from Los Angeles to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured it would make it in about an hour," said Barbara Kornylo of 
Lockheed, the builder of the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71, designed in the early 1960s, is able to cruise faster than three 
times the speed of sound. The planes were built with a titanium alloy and can 
withstand temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The first flight of 
the SR-71 was on Dec. 22, 1964, the Smithsonian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird flies at an average speed of 2,200 m.p.h., about 400 m.p.h. to 
500 m.p.h. faster than the Concorde, which is the fastest airplane in 
commercial operation, Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71 was never designed for commercial passenger use. It has seats only 
for a pilot and a reconnaissance systems officer and was designed to fly high, 
fast and unarmed on photographic reconnaissance missions. Because of the high 
altitudes the aircraft can reach, crew members on missions had to wear pressure 
suits and be connected to life support systems. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71s were officially retired on Feb. 26, but Lockheed requested one of 
them to break some records publicly on its last flight, something that the 
plane has been doing -- but on a classified basis -- for years, Kornylo said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to breaking the world Los Angeles-to-Washington record set several 
years ago by pilot Brooke Knapp in her Lear jet 35A, the Blackbird also set 
speed records for the following: Los Angeles to Washington, 2,153.24 m.p.h.; 
St. Louis to Cincinnati, 2,242.48 m.p.h., and Kansas City to Washington, 
2,200.94 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird, after fueling over the Pacific Ocean from an Air Force KC-135, a 
type of flying gas station, passed through a radar screen and quickly 
accelerated past the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Southland residents, hearing the sonic boom, called police to report the sound 
of an explosion or earthquake, Sgt. James McClard said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Air Force has never publicly revealed how many SR-71s it commissioned 
to be built, 12 of them were stationed at Beale Air Force Base in Northern 
California in January. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the SR-71 that flew today, one is going to a museum at Warner-Robbins 
Air Force Base in Georgia, another to March Air Force Base in Southern 
California and three to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
use in high-altitude research.

   As in a dream, a P-51 Mustang fighter from World War II materialized out of the bright blue sky, thundered past the crowds at the edge of the airport runway, swept up into a steep, banking turn and disappeared into dazzlements of sunlight. 
Then, as if a Mustang weren't enough, a Japanese Zero -- a real Zero, for Pete's sake! -- swooped down from nowhere into a slow roll, displaying the vivid red suns on its khaki wings. 

   Whose dream, you ask? 
Why, my dream, for one, the martial fantasy of a child of the 1940s. 
But I'm hardly alone in my delight with such fly-by-day entertainments as the one staged here recently at a hot, dusty airport that started life as a training field in World War II. 
At airports across the country, crowds of all ages are turning out to ogle airplanes old and new. 
Another air-show season is upon us. 

   No one knows how many people go to air shows, though attendance must be up there in the millions. 
It's tricky enough to keep track of the events. 
One source, an aviation monthly in California called the Pacific Flyer, lists 61 shows, fairs, expos and "warbird extravaganzas" in the U.S. and Canada before the end of September. 
Some of the big ones star the Air Force's Thunderbirds or the Navy's Blue Angels, stunt teams that propagandize heart-stoppingly, if indirectly, on behalf of military aviation. 
Many shows feature fly-bys of World War II aircraft that have been restored by private owners, or by outfits such as Chino's Planes of Fame Museum. 
A few shows end in tragedy or near-tragedy. 
Last month at El Toro, Calif., a Marine Corps pilot was severely injured when his Hornet fighter crashed during a demonstration loop. 

   The closest call at Chino, less than an hour's drive east of Los Angeles, came when a gust of wind blew a big red umbrella off a Superpretzel stand, and the umbrella dealt a glancing blow to a spectator's camcorder. 
There was no lack of thrills for me, though. 
This was my first warbird extravaganza, and I was a pushover from the start. 

   Like other little boys during World War II, I'd drawn furtive pictures of fighters and bombers at my grammar school desk. 
In 1944, at the age of 12, I had even written a poem -- a love poem, I'm afraid you'd have to call it -- in praise of the P-51 Mustang. 
"This ship has the lines of a powerful steed," it began, "and she's got the speed of a shot." 
I remember sending it to the Mustang's builders, North American Aircraft, and receiving an 8x10 glossy of my inamorata in flight. 

   Now I was watching a Mustang, as well as the last flyable Zero in the world, or so they said, and also startling myself, at every turn, with nuggets of knowledge I hadn't known I still possessed. 

   What, for example, was that twin-engine relic parked next to a hangar over there? 
A Lockheed Lodestar, of course, its silhouette straight out of my old aircraft spotter's guide. 
The little low-winged trainer? 
A Navy SJN-5; I studied my reflection in the gorgeously re-chromed spinner of its Hamilton Standard propeller. 
The lumbering bomber with four engines and twin tails? 
I knew it for a B-24 Liberator before the announcer uttered a word. 
And when he asked the audience, "What did the Navy version of the B-24 look like?" 
I could have hollered, as someone else did: "Single tail!" 

   It's easy to see why air shows are so popular. 
First off, they cross the carnival with the shopping mall. 
At one booth inside a hangar at Chino you could buy video highlights of the 1986 Reno Air Races, a videocassette called "Flying the P-47 Thunderbolt," or one called "The Memphis Belle," which happens to be a fine World War II documentary, directed by William Wyler, about a B-17 Flying Fortress. 
Another booth sold toy gliders made of styrofoam -- no more balsa, alas for the ozone layer -- that looped the loop. 

   For sheer action, air shows even beat movies in 70 mm color and six-track Dolby. 
Until last weekend I'd never seen anything like the stunts flown by a pilot named Frank Sanders in a British-built Hawker Sea Fury, which seems to be mostly engine and burns 300 gallons of gasoline an hour. 
As he dove, inverted, toward the unflinching ground, he announced, over a radio patched into the P.A. system: "You'll hear me groan a little bit as we pull a few G's here." 
We groaned on cue as he rolled over, stood the airplane on its tail and hurtled straight up to a stall at 6,000 feet, white smoke trailing from smoke generators at his wingtips. 

   Then there's the obvious lure for war buffs and war lovers. 
During a momentary lull in the dive-bomber fly-by, the announcer interviewed a World War II ace named Mike Russo. 
"One day," Mr. Russo recalled, "I caught a regiment marching down the street, strafed them and killed 376 Germans . . ." I lost the rest of his sentence in engine noise. 

   But you don't have to love war to love warplanes. 
These killing machines from World War II are also objects of grace, distinctive design and raw power. 
They fly through the air the old way -- they churn it, with huge propellers. 
One favorite at Chino was a Boeing Flying Fortress called "Sentimental Journey," which had been flown in for the show from Arizona by members of the Confederate Air Force, the private group that restores and flies old combat planes. 
Metal fatigue may be blighting newer Boeings these days, but it's not a threat that leaped to mind as one admired this B-17G, gleaming as brightly as if it had just been built. 

   "This is an airplane for pure flying," said the smiling pilot, Carl Schmieder, who is much too young to have fought in World War II, and who owns a small chain of jewelry stores in Arizona. 
He told me that the four-engined bomber was built by Douglas, actually, under license from Boeing, at the very end of the war. 
Although it never saw combat, the Fortress flew photo mapping missions in Europe. 

   As we talked in the shade of the bomber's wing, people lined up to look inside for $3 a pop. 
One of them was a retired pharmacist from South Laguna named Frank Keneley. 
He said he'd been a navigator on B-17s during the war, until he was shot down by a Messerschmitt over Germany and interned in a prison camp in Upper Silesia. 
When I expressed my wonderment at how this airplane had been restored, Mr. Keneley agreed, up to a point. 
"It's still not the same for me," he said. 
"All our planes were brand new, and all the wiring was brand new, with that nice new smell you can never get back."

   The Boeing Co. on Wednesday released a photo of a
secret unmanned airplane it said made its first flight Sunday.
   Boeing released few details about the experimental aircraft,
other than to say it successfully completed its first flight and
would undergo further flight tests ``to characterize the
capabilities of this type of vehicle.''
   The airplane has a long, skinny fuselage with narrow, flexible
wings. It is powered by two propeller-driven engines, described by
the trade publication Aviation Week and Space Technology as
Teledyne Continental liquid-cooled piston engines.
   In April 1986, a similar plane was photographed outside a hanger
at the Grant County Airport in Moses Lake, in central Washington.
Boeing declined to comment on that aircraft.
   Boeing said the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had
expressed interest in the aircraft and has provided some money to
participate in flight evaluation. The agency has classified certain
aspects of the aircraft design and performance, Boeing said.
   The plane resembles Boeing's Compass Cope remotely piloted
vehicle, an unmanned aircraft powered by a single jet engine.
Boeing built two of the planes for the Air Force.
   The Compass Cope was 40 feet long with a 90-foot wingspan. It
made its first flight at Edwards Air Force Base in California in
July 1973.

   Classic Planes on the Block

   By Joe Morgenstern

<LP>
   Santa Monica, Calif. -- At a recent auction of classic
aircraft here, I climbed onto the wing of a Curtiss P-40K
Warhawk to check out the cockpit. My pulse was racing, but
not from the climb. As a schoolboy during World War II, I'd
thrilled to newsreel footage of P-40 Flying Tigers shooting
down Japanese Zeros, doodled P-40s in class, even built a
solid -- i.e. non-flying -- model of a P-40, with a tiny
celluloid canopy and, pasted on either side of the nose,
red-and-white decals of the Flying Tigers' fearsome
dentition.
   This P-40 was flyable, as well as buyable by any bidder
with an itch to own a 47-year-old warplane that looked as if
it had just rolled out of the factory. The propeller-driven
fighter had been found in the Aleutian Islands in 1974 --
"the pilot's body was intact," a fact sheet noted -- and
restored to apparent perfection, right down to the rear-view
mirror above the canopy and the rudimentary gun sight, with
which the pilot -- still intact, for all I know, but not
included -- aimed the airplane to aim the guns.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As I jumped from the wing back down to the ground, a young
woman who had been admiring the P-40 smiled and said hello.
She was Japanese, perhaps in her mid-20s, and, according to
her press badge, a writer for a Japanese aviation magazine.
"Excuse me," she said in careful English. "Do you know why
those small Japanese flags are there?" Her eyes went first to
six little rising suns stenciled on the fuselage below the
cockpit, then to my face, which must have revealed my
astonishment. "Each one," I answered very carefully,
"represents one airplane . . . uh . . . shot down."
   "Shot down," she repeated slowly. "Shot . . . down. Oh, I
see. Thank you very much."
   A sense of history wasn't obligatory at the auction, but
it helped. And not just military history -- though that was
evoked by such works of martial art as a British Spitfire and
a twin-engined, twin-tailed Lockheed P-38 Lightning -- but
the history of aviation, which has produced some of the most
beautiful mechanical objects since the Industrial Revolution.
   A sense of wonder helped too, in the face of time-warping
treasures such as a gorgeous two-seater 1938 Curtiss Falcon
(serial No. 1) with red leather upholstery and intricate
patterns of riveted stitchery on dazzlingly polished aluminum
skin; a 1941 Ryan trainer, with sculptured wheel pants and a
birch-and-maple propeller; a 1918 Curtiss Jenny biplane, its
canvas wings held together by wire and hope; and a pristine
red-and-white Fairchild 24, first owned in 1939 by Mary
Pickford and Buddy Rogers and hardly flown since.
   The auction, organized for the benefit of Santa Monica's
superb new Museum of Flight, was the brainchild of David
Price, a 57-year-old industrialist and pilot who also doodled
warbirds as a kid in school, and who grew up half a block
from the airport, which was then called Clover Field (after a
World War I hero named Clover; so much for bucolic
resonances). Recently Mr. Price built the Supermarine
complex, a huge aviation service facility at the airport that
houses the museum plus a chic restaurant called DC-3. (Clover
Field was the home of Douglas Aircraft during the war.)
   "So far David has been carrying this museum," said Donald
Douglas Jr., who attended the auction. "Now we've gotta get
it off his back."
   The two-day affair, which moved more than $7 million of
airplanes and memorabilia, went a long way toward relieving
Mr. Price's back strain; by every reasonable measure,
including fun, it was a resounding success. Fun may have been
the most sensible measure for many buyers. Jim Mills, an
Indiana aircraft-engine installer who bought Mary Pickford's
Fairchild for $40,000 (a record price for the model and also
a steal) extolled the pleasures of flying slow, rolling down
the window and sticking your elbow out into the slipstream.
"That's all these things are any good for anyway, havin' a
good time with."
   Flying slow sounded equally good to Morgan Merrill, an
entrepreneur who lives in Aspen, Colo. He lusted after the
Jenny, which sold to someone else for $175,000, even though
he loves flying his own British-made, fire-engine red Folland
Gnat, a modern-day supersonic jet trainer, at speeds up to
Mach 1.3.
   Fun for other people at the auction involved the calmer
pursuits of connoisseurship and stewardship. Delford Smith,
chairman of the board of Evergreen International, a large
aviation holding company, bought the P-40 for $750,000; a
DC3-built in 1936, and the oldest still flying -- for
$165,000; and a Corsair fighter, with inverted gull wings,
for a record $750,000. (Corsairs are comers in this market.)
Then, prompted by associates and advisers who knew of his
love for bare-metal airplanes, he bid on the glittering
Falcon and got it, for $335,000.
   "We believe in preserving this heritage," said Mr. Smith,
who plans to find homes for his new acquisitions in various
museums. He also urged the Falcon's former owner, Richard
Durand, to call him any time he wanted to visit the airplane,
or even to use it. The gesture was appreciated by Mr. Durand,
who runs an aviation service company in Albuquerque, N.M.,
and who had sold because of what he called a "pretty rough
business climate for us now." But it didn't make the parting
any less sorrowful. "Don't leave it out in the rain," Mr.
Durand told Mr. Smith on the flight line, while his wife
fought back tears.
   The high point of the auction was the sale of the P-38
Lightning, one of six still flying throughout the world. For
one thing, this illustrious airplane, newly painted in attack
black, had been bought and restored by the Museum of Flight,
and was the museum's main chance for earning big bucks. Most
importantly, the Lightning seemed an irresistible symbol of
this country's sovereignty and creativity at a time when
foreign competition has been calling both into serious
question.
   When the bidding began, the crowd rooted for William Lyon,
a 67-year-old retired Air Force general who'd made his
fortune in real estate and airlines, and against an
unidentified rival, represented, via telephone hookup, by
City National Bank of Los Angeles. The rival might have been
from St. Louis or Staten Island, but was instantly assumed to
be Japanese, so the crowd cheered when the bidding finally
ended with Mr. Lyon taking the trophy for a record $1.55
million. They cheered for the general, for the museum and for
the nation, which had brought the Lightning into this world
in 1939 and could now, by God, hang onto it.

<HL> French Officials Discount Malfunction In Airbus Crash, Say Pilot Flew Too Low </HL>

   French Transport Minister Louis Mermaz discounted a systems failure as the cause of Sunday's crash at an air show of an Air France A-320 jetliner, while his deputy said that the plane was flying too low. 

   Officials said the investigation was continuing. 
If the culprit is human error as early signs seem to indicate, airline enthusiasm for the technologically advanced 150-seat twin jet probably will continue unabated. 
If the craft's computer-controlled cockpit is found at fault, sales could be jeopardized. 

   No A-320 orders have been canceled because of the accident, said an Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France. 
"Airlines are realistic," he said. 
"They know there's been an accident and they know there's an investigation under way." 
Another spokesman said later that the transport ministry officials' remarks vindicated the A-320's systems. 

   Mr. Mermaz told a news conference in Paris that initial investigation showed no evidence that the Airbus Industrie model is unsafe in normal operations. 
"No evidence at present throws doubt on the proper functioning of the plane," he said. 

   Meanwhile, Daniel Tennenbaum, director-general of the French civil aviation authority, said the plane was flying at only 30 meters (about 100 feet) when it made a pass over Habsheim airfield in eastern France. 
Mr. Tennenbaum said the new model's fully computerized cockpit requires eight seconds to react to a pilot's command. 
Because the plane was so low, the pilot had only five seconds before the craft slammed into the forest near the airfield and burst into flames. 

   But a U.S. spokesman for Airbus asserted that the accident "has nothing to do with the electronic systems in this airplane. 
There's a lag time between when you tell a plane's engines to do something and when the plane can respond. 
It's not peculiar to this airplane, it's a natural function of a turbojet engine's response to the demand for more power." 

   France's main pilots union said the plane appeared to not respond to commands, a problem which could be due to human error or a systems failure. 
The electronic thrust controls, which the pilot was attempting to operate to gain altitude, need eight seconds to reach full effect, giving little margin for error at low altitude, industry sources said. 

   Three people were killed and at least 50 injured when the chartered plane failed to pull up out of a low swoop over the airfield. 
The plane was carrying 136 journalists, dignitaries and other passengers, some of whom had never flown before. 
It had taken off from a large commercial airport at Mulhouse, on the French-Swiss border, and was scheduled to fly low over the air show, circle Mount Blanc, and return to Mulhouse, according to the Airbus spokesman. 
The presence of passengers on a demonstration flight is sure to raise concerns here about air-show flying regulations. 

   Air France has had two electrical problems on A-320s, the first on the inaugural flight in March and the second last week on a flight that was scheduled to fly to Amsterdam from Paris, but was canceled. 

   The A-320, which attracted a record number of orders prior to making its first flight 16 months ago, now has received 319 firm orders and 203 options and commitments from 21 airlines and leasing companies. 
Carriers that have ordered the model include Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways, Iberia Air Lines, Lufthansa German Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Indian Airlines and South African Airways. 
The biggest aircraft-leasing companies also have ordered the craft. 

   Because of this strong demand and a relatively low production rate, the earliest delivery date currently available for the $35 million jetliner is sometime in 1992 or 1993, the spokesman said. 

   The new model's three present operators, Air France, British Airways and the French domestic carrier Air Inter, all are scheduled to take delivery of additional A320s this year. 
Ansett Airlines of Australia is the next customer, and will begin taking its eight A-320s on order later this year. 
Ansett stressed yesterday that Sunday's crash wouldn't change its plans. 

   British Airways said it would put its two A-320s back into service today after a 36-hour suspension following the accident. 

   In Montreal, a spokesman for Air Canada said the airline will "be following the results of that investigation closely" because it is considering the purchase of 34 Airbus A-320 aircraft to replace its fleet of 33 Boeing 727s. 

   Air Canada's president and chief executive hinted strongly last month that the company had selected Airbus for the order, valued at about $1.2 billion, but a formal announcement hasn't been made. 
The spokesman insisted the airline is still considering the McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-80 and the Boeing 737-400 as well. 

   In Seattle, a Boeing Co. spokesman declined to speculate about the cause of the Airbus A-320 crash or its effect on aircraft orders. 
The spokesman said aircraft typically fly "pretty low" during air show demonstrations. 
"The altitude depends on the skill of the crew, type of plane, its weight and weather conditions. 
How far is too low?" 
St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas declined to comment. 

   A spokesman for Northwest Airlines, which has 100 A-320s on order, said the carrier is in touch with Airbus and is monitoring the situation. 
"We've seen nor heard absolutely nothing that impugns the integrity of that airplane," he added. 

   Northwest, a unit of St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA Inc., is to receive the first of its A-320s in June 1989, with subsequent deliveries into the early 1990s. 

   A spokesman for Pan American World Airways said it was "premature" to comment on the crash. 
The airline, a unit of New York-based Pan Am Corp., has 16 A-320s on order. 
The first is scheduled for delivery in the 1989, the rest in 1990. 

   All of the planes now in service are powered by CFM56-5 engines built by a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Snecma of France. 

   Investigators yesterday examined two flight recorders for clues as to why the plane, which was delivered to Air France only last week, crashed. 

   According to a rescuer, the stunned pilot said: "I wanted to boost the power, but {the plane} didn't respond." 
The pilot and the co-pilot, both uninjured, are among Air France's most experienced and train flight crews on the A-320. 

   Unlike most jetliners, which use conventional hydraulic systems, the A-320 has a revolutionary design that uses computerized controls to convey the pilot's commands. 
Its computers can also override a pilot if he inadvertently orders the plane to do something dangerous. 

   Among the other questions raised yesterday was why the A-320 made the low fly-by with passengers on board. 
Neither Airbus -- a consortium made up of government-supported aerospace concerns in France, West Germany, England and Spain -- nor the other major plane builders allow passengers to ride along in flights that demonstrate more than normal performance of an aircraft. 

   But Air France, which leased the plane to the Mulhouse Aero-Club for the show Sunday, said that all of the necessary permissions had been received.

Aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith, the adventure-loving creator of the World 
War I Sopwith Camel and Pup airplanes, died today. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, born in 1888 into a wealthy engineering family, 
was 16 when the Wright brothers flew under power for the first time in the 
United States. He taught himself to fly in 1910 and began designing airplanes 
at age 26. Sopwith, who was an accomplished race car driver and yachtsman 
before he discovered his passion for airplanes, set several early flying 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of crashes in those days but, bless you, it was fun," he recalled 
on his 100th birthday last year. "This new experience of flying was one of the 
most exhilarating things that had ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 Sopwith airplanes were built for action in World War I, 
including 6,000 Camels, which shot down more enemy aircraft than any other 
allied plane. A Camel flown by Roy Brown shot down the German Baron Von 
Richthofen, the infamous "Red Baron."

<HEAD>Air Force Says B-2 Ground Tests Successful</HEAD>

   The B-2 stealth bomber is ready to fly
after successfully completing ground tests, and takeoff could come
as early as Saturday, the Air Force says.
   The bat-winged aircraft sped down a desert runway Thursday,
hitting a top speed of 132 mph and lifting its nose wheel off the
tarmac, said Brig. Gen. Richard Scofield, director of the B-2
program.
   ``We've completed all the taxi tests prior to going to first
flight,'' Scofield said. ``The airplane is in good shape.''
   The bomber, in development for more than a decade, has been
subjected to extensive computer-simulated flights but has never
actually lifted off a runway.
   It incorporates revolutionary technologies and the use of
lightweight composite material to elude radar by absorbing radar
energy, rather than reflecting it as conventional aircraft do.
   But although the bomber appears ready to fly, congressional
opposition to the costly defense program threatens to ground the B-2
just as it is rising to prove its secret capabilities.
   Congressmen warned Air Force officials earlier this week that
they face a tough uphill fight with the B-2, which recent estimates
indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history.
   ``Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the
B-2 will become a museum piece,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pleaded with Congress
not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying the bomber is
essential for U.S. forces to ``penetrate improving Soviet air
defenses.''
   Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney
urged lawmakers to try to overcome ``sticker shock'' at the $500
million to $750 million price for each plane and to restore $800
million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month.
   At Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Scofield refused to be drawn
into the political debate, telling reporters: ``I'm working on the
airplane end of the thing _ and the airplane is doing just fine.''
   Scofield said engineers from Northrop Corp., which designed and
built the B-2, and Air Force officials would spend at least one day
evaluating data gathered during Thursday's ground tests.
   ``We will have to see what the data tells us,'' the general said.
``We'll be working on a number of issues.''
   Nevertheless, he made clear that Northrop and Air Force officials
believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne.
   After maintaining for years that the B-2 didn't exist, the Air
Force invited the media and dignitaries to a coming-out ceremony
last November.
   Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the
bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next
two weeks.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2. Manufactured by Northrop in Palmdale, the plane will
cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in
fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.

A string of 48s brought an aviation record to San Diego lawyer Bill Wright. He 
touched down in all 48 contiguous states in his 1948 airplane within 48 hours 
of flying time. 
</P>
<P>
When Wright and two crewmen landed in Pendleton, Ore., last Tuesday, they had 
flown for 44 hours, 35 minutes and 57 seconds over 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 54, owner and pilot of the plane; Michael La France, 32, of San Diego, 
his co-pilot and mechanic, and Eric Presten, 25, of San Jose, a National 
Aeronautics Assn. certified judge, flew around the continental United States in 
a 1948 Luscombe 11-A Silvaire Sedan, the first to set a speed record for the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
In designing the route, Wright chose general-aviation airports at which any 
pilot could land because he wanted to do something other people could repeat. 
</P>
<P>
He used a long-range navigation device called LORAN and other standard 
navigation equipment for the flight, which was made during Learn to Fly Month. 
</P>
<P>
The crew, which took off from Needles on July 1, stayed at some airports for as 
few as 15 minutes, but spent the night at others, resting and waiting for 
better weather, Presten said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started the idea, I wasn't thinking of setting a record, but some 
guys at the National Aeronautics Assn. encouraged me to get into it," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men flew at an average speed of 130 m.p.h., beating their goal of 
making the trip in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
La France, who owns a smaller two-seat 1949 Luscombe, said that although he had 
little mechanical work to do on the airplane during the trip, the flying was 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
"It really called on all my aviation experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wright and La France said the '48 Luscombe is fairly easy to fly because 
the 92 produced were designed with businessmen and families in mind. In fact, 
the inside of Wright's plane looks a lot like a car because the parts come from 
automobile manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The original upholstery, ashtrays and dome lights were purchased from Cadillac, 
and the panel incorporates prewar Studebaker and Stewart-Warner parts. The 
3,700-square-inch window space also resembles that of a car, with its rear 
windows and overhead skylights.

<TEXT>
   The radar-evading B-2
stealth bomber took its maiden flight over the Mojave Desert on
Monday, impressing its pilots while crowds cheered and political
debate intensified over the costly plane's fate.
   ``If we appear a little giggly about all of this, it was a lot of
fun,'' said Air Force Col. Richard Couch, one of two pilots on the
test flight.
   The nearly two-hour flight appeared flawless to people who
watched the sinister-looking flying wing take off from
secrecy-shrouded Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale shortly after 6:30
a.m. and land at nearby Edwards Air Force Base.
   The four-engine bomber, built with advanced composite materials
and a shape that are not easily detectable by radar, flew at 10,000
feet over the Antelope Valley at three speeds, accompanied by two
F-16 fighters through a clear sky.
   The B-2 was temporarily arrayed with radar reflective material to
allow test personnel to keep track of it on radar screens.
   The B-2, a tailless, 172-foot-long wing with a bulge in the
middle rather than a conventional fuselage, finally landed and
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble, stopped for several
minutes and then taxied off into a hangar.
   ``We were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft. It
was very close to the simulators,'' said Bruce J. Hinds, chief test
pilot for Northrop Corp.'s B-2 division, who flew the plane with
Couch.
   During takeoff, they intended to pitch the plane to a 7{-degree
angle before it was supposed to become airborne, but ``we never got
there,'' Couch told reporters. ``The airplane just very smoothly
came off the ground.''
   Couch called the B-2 a ``very nimble aircraft'' and said it made
a ``Grade A'' landing.
   ``I had to ask the tower if we were on the ground,'' Couch said.
   The plane needed only about 5,000 feet of the 11,000-foot takeoff
runway and the wheels remained down throughout the flight, a normal
practice for a maiden flight. The B-2 used only about 5,000 feet of
runway on landing.
   The Air Force had planned to evaluate data and nspect the plane
for about five weeks before trying a second flight. However, the
results were so heartening that the next flight will probably be
sooner, said Gen. Bernard T. P. Randolph, commander of the Air Force
Systems Command.
   ``This is a historic day in aviation,'' Randolph said. ``It
basically negates the air defenses that have been building up over
many years around the world.''
   At the Pentagon, officials issued a statement by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney on the B-2 flight:
   ``I am pleased with the success of the project to date. It is
good to see that the test program appears to validate the judgments
made previously by the Department of Defense and Congress to go
forward with the B-2.''
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has
balked at the thought of paying Northrop more than $500 million
apiece for 132 bombers.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, approving President Bush's
$305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal 1990, stipulated
Friday that no new money be spent on the B-2 until it flew. The
Pentagon seeks $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year
and may need $8 billion in each of the three peak years of
production, 1992 to '94.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said in Washington that in spite of the
successful flight, the program is ``still in trouble in the House.''
   The B-2's maiden flight was long awaited by aviation buffs and
workers from the desert aerospace community. Thousands gathered
among the tumbleweeds outside Plant 42 and shouted ``Here they
come!'' when the great wing's dark shadow passed over. ``Great
God,'' exclaimed Northrop employee Les Holland.
   The ``Star Spangled Banner'' was sung beside the runway by Alis
Clausen, employee at a local cable TV station. Air Force Capt. Tess
Taft unfurled the Stars and Stripes.
   ``I think it's time in the debate that we begin stressing the
capabilities of the aircraft instead of placing all ephasis on the
cost. We are a nation with global responsibilities,'' said Northrop
spokesman Les Daly, a longtime proponent of the flying wing concept.
   The B-2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aging fleet of B-52
bombers that form part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent against the
Soviet Union.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar. Though
the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated
for several years.
   The B-2's first flight followed a series of ground speed tests.
It was supposed to fly Saturday but a low fuel pressure reading
forced a delay.
   Montgomery, the Mississippi congressman, said an amendment will
be offered in the House to stop all B-2 funding when the defense
bill comes up on the floor next week. He said the possibility of its
passing is ``realistic.''
   ``I believe what I'm leaning toward right now is to continue the
program mainly in research,'' he said.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., also a member of the House
Armed Services Committee and an opponent of the stealth bomber, said
she hoped the maiden flight would not result in a blank check for
the Pentagon.
   Schroeder supports an amendment to the defense bill that would
stop production of the B-2 after 13 planes until further tests and
flights.

THE TWO WHO FLEW OVER ALASKA'S VOLCANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES HILLINGER

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAKE CLARK NATIONAL PARK, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For days after Redoubt Volcano erupted Dec. 13, the weather was so bad that no 
airplane could get near the 10,197-foot mountain -- except one. 
</P>
<P>
That was a Cessna 185 flown by Hollis Twitchell, Lake Clark National Park's 
only year-round ranger and one of a handful of National Park Service 
pilot-rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a week-and-a-half before other planes (from Anchorage) were able to fly 
over the volcano. We were lucky. We were in the National Park where the volcano 
is located and we were upwind from the mountain," explained Twitchell, 39, a 
ranger in the park since its establishment in December, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We flew to the peak, some 45 miles from our airstrip, made observations, shot 
still photos and videotaped the spectacular event," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hutchison, 55, Lake Clark National Park superintendent who is based in 
Anchorage in winter and spends summer in the park, happened to be at Lake Clark 
when the volcano blew its top a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchison flew several times with Twitchell. The first photographs in 
newspapers and the first footage shown on TV around the world were shot by the 
two men. 
</P>
<P>
After the initial eruption, "a lava dome a quarter of a mile to a half-mile 
across formed on the north flank of Redoubt beneath the summit. Then a second 
major eruption occurred Jan. 2. When Hollis and I flew over the volcano after 
that blowout, the dome was gone. It had been blasted 20 miles down the mountain 
into Cook Inlet," said Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
"Lava flowing out of the mountain looks gray like tooth paste," Twitchell said. 
"It isn't flaming red as one would expect. Cascading down the mountain through 
the Drift River drainage are smoldering boulders, steaming debris. We have been 
shooting close-ups of the amazing glacial melt." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell also described the towering ash plumes during the three major 
eruptions -- Dec. 13, Jan. 2 and "the biggest so far, more than 8 miles high" 
last Monday. He mentioned the "incredible display of lightning horizontally, 
vertically, all directions, bouncing off snow-covered peaks" on the night of 
Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
It was a plume of ash from Redoubt on Dec. 1 that choked off power in four 
engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747, causing the jet to fall more 
than 2 miles before the engines restarted and the plane made a safe emergency 
landing in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
News reports locate the mountain 110 miles southwest of Anchorage but fail to 
place the volcano in Lake Clark National Park. One of the reasons is because 
few have ever heard of, let alone visited, Lake Clark National Park and 
National Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
The park and preserve together total 4 million acres, almost twice the size of 
Yellowstone. "A national preserve administered by the Park Service is something 
unique to Alaska. It's an area where hunting is permitted. Here, the principal 
game taken, in season, are caribou, moose, Dall sheep and bear," Hutchison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The national park and national preserve, which don't have any paved roads or 
any man-made trails, are so remote that access is almost entirely by charter 
planes, private planes and Lake Clark Air, a small commuter operation that 
flies 140 miles from Anchorage to Port Alsworth, which is on the shores of Lake 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
There are six small lodges on Lake Clark, open four months of the year and 
booked far in advance. The lodges have float planes to fly hunters into remote 
areas, where they are dropped off and picked up a week to 10 days later. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain climbers, hikers, river rafters and fishermen are also flown into 
wilderness areas on float planes. But the park is so vast and visitors are so 
few, it is rare for anyone to encounter another human being in the spectacular 
back country. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of glaciers. One glacier alone, Double Glacier, 100 square 
miles, is bigger than most national parks. The park is riveted with cascading 
wild and scenic rivers, innumerable crystal-clear mountain lakes, a chaotic 
jumbo of towering peaks, serrated ridges and sheer granite spires. 
</P>
<P>
The Tusk, a 5,730-foot monolith resembling a giant canine tooth, was scaled the 
first time a couple of years ago. Hundreds of other peaks have never been 
climbed. The terrain is so rugged that man has never set foot in most of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The park and preserve are named after the 42-mile-long, 1- to 4-mile-wide 
alpine lake embraced by the awesome Chigmit Mountains. The unbelievably 
stunning lake was discovered by John W. Clark in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Port Alsworth, the only community in the park and preserve, has a year-round 
population of 30, half of them students in the Port Alsworth Elementary School. 
There are no stores, no restaurants, no doctors, no nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Since the only landing strip in the park and preserve is in Port Alsworth, 
Twitchell lands his Cessna or Piper Super Cub on gravel bars, beaches, tundra, 
and frozen rivers and lakes in the winter to monitor wildlife populations and 
to mount rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
Every year during the last nine years, the pilot-ranger has flown search 
patterns for more than a dozen light planes that have crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous place to fly. Miserable weather closes in within minutes. 
Some private pilots overload their planes with game and passengers. There are 
many accidents and loss of life," said Twitchell. 
</P>
<P>
He is the nearest thing to a doctor, rendering first aid to hikers, hunters, 
mountain climbers and fishermen who have heart attacks, falls or meet with 
other mishaps. Then he flies them to a hospital in Anchorage, 1 1/2 hours away 
by small plane. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its own erupting volcano, Lake Clark will continue to be little-known 
and seldom-visited. Although the scenery is unrivaled, the National Park is too 
remote and too difficult to reach. 
</P>
<P>
Park superintendent Hutchison expects a few people to charter airplanes and fly 
over the volcano when it quiets down. "But no one will be hiking up the 
mountain to look into the crater or walk the lava-encrusted path of debris," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nowhere nearby to land an airplane, and the terrain is inaccessible 
and too distant to reach on foot," he said. "Redoubt Volcano would be a 
tremendous drawing card in any other National Park, but unfortunately not 
here."

   In coming months, Congress must decide whether
the B-2 ``stealth bomber,'' the most expensive plane ever designed
and built, is a weapon the United States can't afford to do without,
or simply can't afford. Yet for all the secrecy surrounding this
high-tech marvel, the ideas behind it are, by aviation standards,
almost ancient history.

<TEXT>
   It rests, in pieces, in a grimy corner of a
museum warehouse in suburban Silver Hill, Md., long forgotten by the
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable
bomber in the skies.
   Re-assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or a
stub-tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that the
enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet-powered flying wing's
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves,
rather than reflect them.
   No, the Northrop B-2 bomber, the world's most expensive airplane,
hasn't already become a dust-gathering relic _ although some
critics, convinced the albatross is the only sea-creature to which
it should be compared, wish that were so.
   The astonishing lookalike in Silver Hill is indeed a stealth
warplane, but it was secretly built and test-flown 45 years ago by
Nazi Germany.
   For all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word ``stealth''
since it was introduced to the U.S. military vocabulary in 1980, the
B-2 and such radar-evading relatives as the F-117A fighter represent
concepts which, by aviation standards, are almost ancient.
   The B-2 has been financed, until this year, out of the Pentagon's
mysterious ``black'' budget. For eight years, the taxpayers spent
$22.4 billion without knowing it, and without knowing what they were
getting for it.
   What they got, when it was finally nosed heavenward in July, was
a strange, plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably
won't fly much higher, much farther or any faster than the Strategic
Air Command's old reliable, the B-52.
   The B-2 is 17 feet tall, 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172
feet. It is powered by four General Electric F-118 engines,
virtually the same engines as used on the F-14 fighter but without
afterburners. Its range is 6,900 miles without refueling, and 11,500
miles with one midair refueling. It will have a maximum takeoff
weight of 350,000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of
bombs or missiles, nuclear or conventional, 10,000 pounds less than
the B-52. Private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to
55,000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 0.8 to 0.85, or about 530-560
mph.
   There's nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers.
What is dazzling, presumably, is the stuff the Air Force won't talk
about _ the stealth technology, computerized flight controls,
``quiet'' on-board radar, and other electronic systems, possibly
employing fiber optics, designed to withstand the electromagnetic
interference generated by nuclear blasts.
   The Air Force wants to spend an additional $50 billion or so to
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company, Northrop, which for
years hadn't made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter, the
F-5.
   Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello, who left as
undersecretary of defense in May, wanted to scuttle the program. In
an interview with The Washington Post, he said he told then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci last year that ``it's being brought to you
by the same company that brought you'' a series of troubled
programs, including guidance systems for the MX and air-launched
cruise missiles. ``What makes you think they'll do better (with the
B-2)?''
   Eight days after the B-2's maiden flight July 17, Pentagon and
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by
the Justice Department's fraud unit concerning Northrop's billing
practices on the project. The company said it was unaware of the
probe.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones says without reservation that
the B-2 is an ``extraordinary'' success. Defense Secretary Richard
B. Cheney calls it ``absolutely vital'' to strategic deterrence.
President Bush says doing without it would be ``devastating'' to
arms-control negotiations with the Soviets.
   The security and secrecy surrounding the project have been
phenomenal, perhaps rivaled only by elements of the Star Wars
program and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb in
World War II. Northrop removed it from the rest of its own
organization, forming a new division called Advanced Products and
housing it at a closed auto plant in Pico Rivera, Calif. It
surrounded the plant, as well as the sister assembly complex at
Palmdale, Calif., with fences topped by razor wire.
   According to Costello, security has accounted for 5 percent of
the costs to date. With more than $22.4 billion spent so far, that
amounts to more than $1 billion.
   The tight security imposed additional costs. Efficiency suffered
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didn't know
what their subordinates were doing. ``I couldn't even ask,'' one
former Northrop official told the Los Angeles Times last year. ``For
all I knew, they were going to the movies every day.''
   Some could have. When employees were hired, they could not go
directly to work until their security clearances were finished. Many
were assigned for weeks to make-work jobs in an area of the plant
they nicknamed the ``drunk tank.''
   Unbeknownst to the public, the biggest snag occurred halfway
through the seven-year design period when the Air Force changed its
mind about the B-2's mission. The Pentagon originally ordered a
high-altitude bomber. Now it wanted one that could penetrate at low
levels as well, probably because it was fearful the Soviet Union was
developing the same new radar technology, called OTHB for Over the
Horizon Backscatter. The still super-secret radar system, the
Pentagon has privately acknowledged, offers new possibilities for
detecting stealth airplanes, though it is said to be ineffective
within 500 miles.
   Northrop's designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower
altitudes, where turbulence is greater. That took a year and another
$1 billion. An additional six-month delay was necessary for other
design changes, related especially to the engine inlets. In 1987,
two years before Congress began public debate over funding for the
B-2, the Pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years
in the face of Gramm-Rudman budget restrictions. Cheney has
postponed production yet another year; the Pentagon now hopes to
build all 132 planes by 1999, versus the original target of 1995.

CRASH OF EXPERIMENTAL PLANE STIRS SAFETY DEBATE 
</P>

<P>
The crash-landing of a small test plane at Torrance Municipal Airport last 
month has some residents and officials questioning whether experimental 
aircraft ought to be flying out of an airport that is in the midst of homes and 
small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
One city resident told the Torrance City Council on Tuesday that experimental 
airplanes like the one that crashed should not be flying over city 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a safe situation," Joseph Arciuch complained. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members requested a staff report about the rules governing such 
experimental airplanes, which are primarily small, home-built craft. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a highly developed urban area," said Councilman Bill Applegate, who 
said that unproven planes that need fine tuning should be flown in a less 
developed area. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman George Nakano said that although he does not favor an outright ban, 
he does have concerns about the safety of experimental planes. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the plane, John Parker, 52, of Torrance, says the matter is being 
blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
His craft -- a small aluminum plane called "American Special" -- met all 
federal requirements, according to Parker, who is well-known among those who 
build and race their own planes. 
</P>
<P>
And some aviation experts say that experimental aircraft are being unduly 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were going to build your own plane that you were going to fly, wouldn't 
you go the extra mile to make sure it was safe?" asked John Burton, spokesman 
at the Experimental Aircraft Assn., based in Oshkosh, Wis. "Home-built pilots 
have a vested interest in safety." 
</P>
<P>
The debate is not new. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, city officials talked of banning experimental aircraft last 
October after the crash of a home-built plane. They found out later that the 
city lacked authority to enact a sweeping ban on the planes. In that accident, 
a passenger in the plane was hurt, a home was set on fire and another was 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance accident was much less dramatic. Parker's plane had trouble 
shortly after taking off at 3:14 p.m. on June 28. The plane was attempting to 
land without power when it hit the ground, remaining upright, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
"He landed hard. There was substantial damage to the aircraft and minor 
injuries to the pilot," said Barbara Abels, public affairs officer with the 
Federal Aviation Administration, Western Pacific Region. The FAA is 
investigating the cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was a "proof-of-concept" aircraft, said Parker, a craft he was using 
to test systems such as engine controls and landing gear. It had flown about 70 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an airplane you fly every day. It's not a pleasure plane -- it's a 
research vehicle," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker has flown and raced planes extensively. "He's quite well-known in the 
air-racing world," said Jack Cox, editor in chief of Experimental Aircraft 
Assn. publications. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident June 20, Parker's plane exceeded noise limits at the 
airport, said David Roelen, city environmental quality officer. Roelen said he 
wrote Parker, stating that any future complaints about noise levels would be 
referred to a city board that oversees airport noise matters. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has special regulations for experimental aircraft, said Fred Farrar, a 
spokesman at the agency's Washington headquarters. They must get special 
air-worthiness certificates after an FAA inspection and must spend their first 
40 hours of flight over unpopulated areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most experimental aircraft are built by owners from kits, though not every kit 
plane is an experimental craft.

   The meadow where Orville and Wilbur Wright
learned to turn and maneuver the world's first airplanes has been
dedicated as a national historic landmark.
   With a replica of one of Wright brothers' planes buzzing
overhead, about 400 military and civilian dignitaries attended the
dedication ceremony Friday at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field on
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
   The Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17,
1903. They then returned to Dayton and learned to maneuver the
aircraft at Huffman Prairie.
   ``They spent almost the whole year learning how to turn it and
control it,'' said base historian Lois Walker. ``The very first
circle in powered flight history was made on Sept. 20, 1904.''
   The 84-acre field was designated an historic landmark last July.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clarence L. ``Kelly'' Johnson, creator of
Lockheed Corp.'s secret ``Skunk Works'' that created America's
first production jet fighter and a generation of spyplanes, died
Friday. He was 80.
   Johnson, who led the design of the U-2, the SR-71 Blackbird and
more than 40 other airplanes and spacecraft, died at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank after a long illness, Lockheed said. The
illness was not disclosed.
   Using titanium and sleek shapes, Johnson's designs broke the
``thermal thicket,'' the high-heat problem of supersonic flight,
said Donald Lopez, a senior advisor at the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   Use of titanium alloy on the SR-71 rather than standard aluminum
made flight at high speed possible despite 800-degree Fahrenheit
temperatures. The Blackbird flies at more than 2,000 mph and above
85,000 feet.
   ``The skin would glow sometimes,'' Lopez said of the Blackbirds,
recently retired by the Air Force. ``Pilots could feel the heat
coming in.''
   Johnson organized the Skunk Works in Burbank in 1943 to build
the XP-80 Shooting Star, the United States' first production jet
fighter.
   Many designs bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning in World War II,
the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V
antisubmarine patrol aircraft, the Agena spacecraft, and the F-104
Starfighter, the first production aircraft to fly at twice the
speed of sound.
   The U-2 was the first plane able to make a sustained flight
above 60,000 feet, and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird remain the
fastest and highest-flying planes in the world. The Blackbird's
maximum speed and altitude remain classified.
   The Air and Space Museum saluted Johnson in its gallery of
pioneers.
   Born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson was the
seventh of nine children of Swedish immigrant parents. From his
father, a carpenter and bricklayer, Johnson developed a respect for
tools. According to Lockheed, he knew by the time he was 12 that he
wanted to build airplanes.
   He studied aeronautical engineering at the University of
Michigan, and worked as a consultant on the aerodynamic design of
cars that were to run in the Indianapolis 500.
   He went to work for Lockheed the same year he received his
master's degree, 1933. He went on to head the Skunk Works for 30
years.
   The secrecy of the Skunk Works is so great that even the origin
of the name is shrouded in mystery, although it apparently was
derived from Al Capp's cartoon strip, ``Li'l Abner,'' which
featured a moonshine distillery called the Skonk Works.
   Johnson retired as a senior vice president in 1975 and retired
from Lockheed's board of directors in 1980.
   Tony LeVier, the Skunk Works' former chief test pilot, described
Johnson as a stern father figure with a direct line to the
Pentagon.
   And his planes, LeVier said, ``flew like a dream.''
   ``My God,'' he said. ``They were advanced.''
   Johnson is survived by his wife Nancy, a brother and a sister.

   The airplanes will be supplemented by a system of tethered radar
balloons in the southeast, the Gulf of Mexico and all along the
southwestern border. Called aerostats, the balloons fly 10,000 feet
above the surface and provide coverage at lower altitudes, where
drug smugglers usually fly.
   Only four of 17 planned aerostats are now operational. Funds have
so far been approved for only eight more.
   ``Once we reach 1991, if we have the aerostats in place and
receive the kind of support we anticipate from the military, we will
have a very effective shield,'' said English. ``That's not to say
this will be the answer to the war on drugs. This does not mean
drugs won't come in, but it will be far more expensive, dangerous
and difficult.''
   Once the aerostat radar ``shield'' is operating from Florida to
California, the P3 flying detection platforms will come into their
own. These aircraft can see 360 degrees around and 200 miles away.
Radar specialists at two computer terminals inside can bring up
displays by simply touching their screens.
   As airplanes appear as small squares, the operator assesses their
speed, altitude, course and other data and assigns them colors:
green for friendly, yellow for unknown and red for hostile.
   The surveillance branch in Corpus Christi says 75 arrests
resulted from its detection program from July last year through
September of 1988.
   The single P3 AEW has operated only since July, and 15 of the
arrests have been made since then.
   In the 14-month period, 30 land vehicles or boats and 17
airplanes were seized, and five of the aircraft were taken since the
P3 detection platform has been flying.
   The entire air branch reported 438 arrests in fiscal 1988, up
from 250 in 1987 and 167 in 1986. Also in fiscal 1988, 71 airplanes,
176 vehicles and 22 boats were seized.
   The P3 detection platforms will eventually fly mostly ``defense
in depth'' missions, according to Customs officials.
   A concept already tested at least four times successfully,
Customs aircraft would fly long hours off the coast of producer
countries such as Colombia and observe virtually every air departure
from a known drug region. This would make it far easier to sort
suspicious from legitimate aircraft, one of the most difficult jobs
now facing the surveillance unit.
   In the first such endurance test off Colombia, the detection rate
was regarded as phenomenal, and the deterrent was so strong that
smugglers stopped flying once they realized something was amiss.
   ``The best hunting I've had,'' one radar operator said of the
three Customs Service and one Coast Guard aircraft that flew in
shifts for 16 hours a day.
   Adams, the surveillance unit air branch chief, said that without
such operations, the surveillance unit is reduced to playing ``a
chess game'' in the air.
   ``It's really hard to be in the right place at the right time,''
said radar operator Buck Benham, as he scanned the skies on his
radar scope in one of the four P3 trackers without the sophisticated
dome.
   Instead of chasing airborne suspects, Benham was trying to take
over the dome plane's detection job, which he likened to ``flying
around with a flashlight.''
   Customs can count on little help from countries south of the
border. Only two countries provide timely assistance, according to
aircrews: the Dominican Republic, which will launch a military
aircraft on request, and the Bahamas, which places officers on
U.S.-flown helicopters.
   Crewmen said it is difficult to gain cooperation from Mexico.
Calls for assistance in chasing boats and planes have to be routed
through the federal government in Washington, and the process can
take four hours. In that time, smugglers often dump their loads or
land south of the border.

FLIGHT ON RESTORED B-17 IS A JOURNEY TO THE PAST

The air in the radio compartment throbs angrily and the tentative shudder of 
the fuselage at low revolutions becomes a shake and then a wild cacophony of 
rattles and growls and blasting roars as, on the other side of the bomb bay, 
David Tallichet presses the four throttles forward. The old plane strains 
against the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Tallichet releases the pressure on the rudder pedals and Number 
44-83546 begins its takeoff run, rapidly accelerating toward the hills in the 
west. Still ground-bound, the plane continues to buffet and wind begins to howl 
through the open hatch above the radio compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost imperceptibly, we are airborne, and Tallichet begins the slow 
climb out of Chino Airport. It is an exalting sight to look backward out of the 
hatch, down the fuselage and past the tail and see the dairy farms recede in 
the crackling air as Number 44-83546 thunders into the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Below, on the roads, brake lights wink on and cars slow as the drivers see the 
great green ghost rising. It is an awesome object, out of place and time, and 
it leaves an indelible print on the mind's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes below squint to see the writing on the nose, beneath the gun. Does it 
really say "Memphis Belle?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It was a visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington in the 
early 1960s, along with some encouragement from another collector, that did it, 
Tallichet says. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Washington excited," he says. "I said, by God, that's what I'm going to 
do. I'm going to collect airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
Tallichet had the means to do it, and the flying background. He flew 21 
missions over occupied Europe in early 1945 as the co-pilot of a B-17 Flying 
Fortress heavy bomber. After the war he remained on active Air Force reserve 
status until 1957, flying a variety of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1958, after a dissatisfying stint as a supply officer, he went on 
inactive status and opened his first restaurant, the Reef in Long Beach. It was 
the first of what would become a nationwide network of restaurants operated by 
Anaheim-based Specialty Restaurants Corp., of which Tallichet is today 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
As the money came in from the successful restaurant business, Tallichet and his 
partner at the time bought a pair of vintage planes, a Stearman and a T-34. 
Shortly after, Tallichet bought his first P-51 Mustang fighter for $13,000 and 
the promise of extensive spare parts that could be sold to pay off the loan. 
The seller skipped with the parts, leaving Tallichet to pick up the tab. Today, 
he said, he still has the restored P-51, which is now worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
After his Smithsonian visit, Tallichet began collecting and swapping planes 
throughout the world with the elan of a horse trader. He created the 
Chino-based Military Aircraft Restoration Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Specialty Restaurants, specifically to handle the traffic in vintage military 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"In relation to today," he says, "the planes were quite cheap and business was 
good, and I made quite a few trips" to places like New Guinea, the Yukon 
territory of British Columbia, India -- all to buy or sell old airplanes. He 
has owned, bought, traded or restored -- and, for the most part, flown -- such 
historical craft as B-25 Mitchell bombers, Korean-era MiG jets, P-40 Tomahawk 
fighters, F4U Corsairs, even giant B-29 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 68-year-old Orange resident, through his company, owns about 100 
planes in various stages of restoration, most of which are World War II vintage 
military aircraft. The majority of the collection is at Chino Airport. Between 
30 and 40 of them, he says, are fully airworthy. By any yardstick, it is an 
impressive collection. 
</P>
<P>
But, Tallichet says, none of the planes have gotten quite the amount of 
attention that Number 44-83546 has received in the past couple of months. It is 
a fully restored B-17G heavy bomber -- and Tallichet flew it during the filming 
of the current film "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
The plane played the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six years ago, combat pilots loved this plane. It was easy to handle. It 
was forgiving. It was tough. Some called it a tank with wings. Dozens of them 
got shot to pieces in the ferocious battles over Europe and still flew their 
crews home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an easy, gentle, sweet airplane to fly," Tallichet says. "You'd have to 
have a lot of bad luck or stupidity or both to hurt yourself in a B-17." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was built for function, purely. Creature comforts in this restored 
model are few. To walk from the radio room amidships to the cockpit, one must 
traverse the bomb bay on a catwalk barely the width of one's shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the darkness of the bomb bay is the brilliance of the cockpit, 
where Tallichet watches the gauges as the plane makes a left climbing bank. The 
whirling propellers are only inches away, but it is less noisy here because the 
engines are now behind us and no wind rushes in. It is perfect flying weather 
and the sun floods in. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is not the sort of flying that commercial airline passengers are 
used to. The four huge, 1,200-horsepower Wright Cyclone engines vibrate every 
inch of the airframe, and the cabin is not pressurized. There are sudden and 
unexpected small surges in altitude that force the knees to bend if one is 
standing up and it makes crawling under the cockpit and into the nose a 
stop-and-go task. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nose holds several revelations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tallichet acquired his B-17 the same way he got many of his planes: though a 
series of sales, deals, horse trades, some coincidental, some intentional. The 
brief version holds that Tallichet acquired and restored an Air Force B-29 
bomber and the Air Force, in return, gave him a huge C-123 transport, which he 
then traded to a firefighting company for a B-17 they were using as a plane to 
drop water and chemicals on forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
He began to scour the world for parts: a top turret, a ball turret, war surplus 
radio gear, bomb bay doors, a Norden bombsight. Everything it would take to 
restore the plane to its wartime configuration. That was eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, Catherine Wyler, daughter of the filmmaker William Wyler, 
began to piece together a plan for a fictionalized film based on her father's 
widely seen wartime documentary film about the combat career of the real 
Memphis Belle and her crew. As the production began to take shape and the 
search began for airworthy B-17s -- there are only a handful left in the world 
-- Catherine Wyler called on her uncle, David Tallichet. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew her uncle had gone through many years of his life and never found 
that hero status he wanted, being kind of a nobody in the war," Tallichet says. 
"So she said, 'Would you like to fly in my movie?' And I said, 'You bet I 
would.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tallichet flew his B-17 to England, where it was modified and 
painted to resemble the real Memphis Belle. (The real Memphis Belle is today 
restored as a static exhibit in Memphis.) 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morgan, the pilot of the original Memphis Belle, made a flight at the 
controls of Tallichet's version of the plane while in England to observe the 
filming, his first flight in a B-17 since the war. A studio press release 
quotes Morgan as saying at the time that the flight "was like five Christmases 
all on the same day." 
</P>
<P>
The nose, like everyplace else in the plane, is cramped, but it doesn't feel 
that way, at least not on the bombardier's seat. The seat is a small, padded 
swivel chair and it is at the very tip of the nose, just behind the Plexiglas 
bubble and the black metal Norden bombsight. The view of the ground is 
unimpeded and panoramic. It is like being hurled through space independent of 
engines, airplanes, physics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sort of view -- and feeling -- you get when you fly in your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is even quieter here, farther forward of the engines, in the area airmen 
called the greenhouse. Still, it's not difficult to visualize what a terrifying 
place it could have been while flying through fields of greasy flak or head-on 
fighter attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 On this flight, however, there is nothing but bright sun and the comforting 
sight, just out of the tiny side windows, of the giant engines drumming away 
relentlessly. It is very easy to fall in love with this airplane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How much does it cost to keep a B-17? That depends, Tallichet says, on whether 
it works. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going good until you lose an engine," he says. "That'll cost you 30 
grand." 
</P>
<P>
And the parts are out there, somewhere, "in a garage, in a back yard. 
Someplace, somebody has the part if you have the money to pay for it," 
Tallichet says. 
</P>
<P>
The aviation fuel the plane gulps by the hundreds of gallons usually is paid 
for by those who hire Tallichet to fly the plane at air shows and other 
aviation events. 
</P>
<P>
He says he doesn't know what his B-17 is worth, and he doesn't want to sell it. 
But, he says, the last airworthy B-17 sold in the United States probably went 
for between $400,000 and $500,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The modern version of the Memphis Belle has kept Tallichet's Military Aircraft 
Restoration Corp. out of the red for the first time in its history, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost money every year but last year," he says. "That's when they made 
'Memphis Belle.' The money we got from that gave us our first profitable year." 
</P>
<P>
Tallichet jokingly calls his passion for planes "an idiot's hobby." But for the 
man who says he never saw a propeller-driven fighter from the pilot's seat of a 
bomber until the filming of "Memphis Belle," it is an enterprise that keeps him 
young. 
</P>
<P>
"You fly it for the challenge, I think," he says. "I'm 68, and it's kind of fun 
to be flying in 1990 when most of my colleagues have long ago given up flying." 
</P>
<P>
The wind and the prop blast rush into the waist ports and over the mock-up 
.50-caliber guns, and the muscles in the thighs work harder to keep the body 
standing as Tallichet makes a final long, lazy bank to set up his final 
approach. The wind, the gently changing view out the open window, the pounding 
of the engines, the gold of the setting sun, all combine to become achingly 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels ($1,350 each) screech quickly on the runway and Tallichet turns the 
giant plane onto a taxiway. The propellers immediately raise a huge cloud of 
dark brown dust from the adjacent dirt infield. Out on the ramp, knots of 
people stand and stare, still transfixed, at this apparition from the past that 
comes thundering slowly toward them. It is too loud, too insistent, too 
overpowering to be a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is almost too wonderful to be real. 
</P>

9). First of all, let me say on behalf of most pilots that we try to follow 
noise abatement procedures when we fly. However, when most of us do fly, we 
think of flying the airplane first. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine an airliner loaded to capacity taking off at airports with relatively 
short runways -- like those at John Wayne Airport. The captain doesn't like to 
reduce power just for noise because that would reduce performance, especially 
in an emergency, but he does. 
</P>
<P>
In Airline Safety, Capt. William Heller suggested that the DC-10 crash at 
Chicago could probably have been avoided. The DC-10, in his view, probably 
could still have flown, even though the engine fell off, but the airplane was 
following procedures dictated by noise abatement requirements and that 
suggested that the airplane did not have the extra airspeed required to 
maintain flight. 
</P>
<P>
I think we should have pity for the captain and his crew whenever you see them 
flying from airports like John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing people don't understand is that they complain about noisy jets 
flying over certain noise-sensitive areas. Most jets, definitely airliners, 
operate under instrument flight rules. Under the rules, a plane is under the 
control of air traffic controllers, so it's not always up to the pilots where 
they fly. During congested periods, a controller will use all available 
airspace so that planes don't collide. 
</P>
<P>
In closing, I just like to say that many old pictures of airports don't show 
homes around them. That should speak for itself. Also I didn't go to Playa del 
Rey like Mr. Monroe suggested, instead I went to a little hill just south of 
LAX. I must say I love to hear and watch jumbos take off and land.

   The U.S. F-14 fighter that shot down Libyan
MiG-23 warplanes over the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday is more
maneuverable and has more sophisticated radar and weapons than the
Soviet-made plane, say retired Navy officers.
   ``We have felt that the F-14 has been and continues to be the
world's best fighter plane,'' said retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, who
served as Chief of Naval Operations in 1970-74.
   The American pilots were almost certainly better trained than
their Libyan adversaries, other experts said.
   ``You are kind of putting professionals up against amateurs,''
said retired Marine Lt. Col. John Buchanan, a pilot who flew the
A-6, another carrier-based aircraft.
   Zumwalt, who lives in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, said
that ``even if the Libyan pilots were as good as ours, the F-14
could outpoint them.''
   U.S. analyses of the MiG-23 show it to be ``a highly
maneuverable, a very high-speed craft. But its avionics and missile
systems cannot compete with the F-14,'' he said.
   Norman Polmar of the Naval Institute Data Base said that the
``the F-14 is a lot more airplane, a lot more expensive to build and
to fly'' than the MiG-23, which epitomizes the Soviet philosophy of
building ``lots of less expensive airplanes.''
   The F-14 has two engines to the MiG's one, giving it greater
acceleration, has twin rear fins, giving it greater maneuverability,
and although both fighters have wings that sweep back in flight,
those on the F-14 operate automatically while the MiG-23's are
directed by the pilot, said Polmar.
   ``The (F-14) pilot does not have to think, he just flies,'' said
Polmar.
   Moreover, the F-14 pilot is assisted by a radar-weapons officer,
while the MiG-23 pilot is alone.
   One of the F-14's strongest points is its sophisticated radar
system, which is capable of looking down and over great distances
while tracking 24 targets at once, according to the Navy. The AWG-9
weapons tracking system can fire up to six Phoenix missiles while
continuing to scan the airspace, according to the Navy.
   Both the F-14 and the MiG-23 entered production more than 15
years ago and fly at similar speeds and heights.
   The F-14 Tomcat, which began aircraft carrier trials in 1972,
remains ``the premier all-weather, day-night air defense fighter in
the world,'' according to the Navy. Production by Grumman of Long
Island, N.Y., is expected to continue into the 1990s.
   A prototype of the MiG-23 was seen in public for the first time
at a Moscow air show in 1967. The fighter, known to NATO pilots as
the Flogger, entered active duty in 1973, according to Jane's ``All
the World`s Aircraft.''
   The Flogger is flown by all the air forces in the Moscow-led
Warsaw Pact and by 1987 had been sold to a dozen other countries,
according to Jane's.
   At takeoff, Floggers have wings that are fully extended to 46
feet and sweep back to about 25 feet as the fighter cruises at Mach
2, twice the speed of sound or about 1,400 mph, at its maximum
altitude of 59,000 feet above sea level, according to Jane's.
   Libya's MiG-23's are armed with one 23mm Gsh-23-L twin barrel gun
and can carry AA-2 Atoll air-to-air missiles, said Polmar.
   Before the incident, Libya's Soviet-built fighters included 44
MiG-21s, 131 MiG-23Es, 67 of the more advanced MiG-25 Foxbats and 92
Sukhoi 20-22 fighters. Additionally, Libya had 22 French-made
Mirages, according to ``The Military Balance,'' published by the
London-based Institute for International Strategic Studies.
   The American F-14 also is a swept-wing aircraft, taking off with
wings spread to 64 feet and flying with the wings swept back to 38
feet as it approaches a top speed of 2.34 times the speed of sound,
or 1,544 mph at its ceiling of 50,000 feet.
   The Tomcat is armed with an M-61 Vulcan 20mm gun and can carry
four Sparrow and four Sidewinder missiles, or a different mixture of
Sparrow, Sidewinder and Phoenix missiles, and it can carry bombs,
the Navy said.
   The F-14s on Wednesday fired Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles,
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said.

   The Air Force rolled out its mysterious
B-2 stealth bomber today, taking the cloak of secrecy off a sleek
flying wing designed to evade enemy radar while carrying nuclear
weapons.
   A band played the ``Stealth Fanfare'' and a crowd of guests
cheered as a decade of secrecy ended about the high-technology
aircraft, the crown jewel of the Pentagon's ``black inventory'' of
supersecret devices.
   The boomerang-shaped plane built by Northrop Corp. has a cockpit
flanked by two engine intakes positioned atop its single, continuous
wing. It is light gray on top and black underneath.
   Spectators were kept at a secure distance of 200 feet and were
unable from their vantage point to see the rear of the aircraft. The
plane, rolled slowly out of a hangar at Air Force Plant 42, had
previously been shown only as a rough drawing.
   ``Let all of us remember America's enduring hope and prayer that
the B-2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent
aircraft will never be flown in anger,'' said Air Force Secretary
Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge Jr.
   On Monday, in one of the aerospace company's first public
pronouncements about the B-2, Northrop spokesman Les Daly said that
the stealth ``is simply not comparable to anything ever done before.
It is the first real computer-age aircraft.''
   The aircraft has not yet flown, and the General Accounting Office
estimates it could cost taxpayers up to $68.5 billion if the
Pentagon builds the 132 aircraft-fleet sought by the Air Force.
   The B-1B, the Air Force's most current operational nuclear
bomber, came in around $250 million apiece, before modifications.
Stealth bombers could cost twice that.
   Critics have questioned the need for such a plane and called it a
destabilizing element in arms-control efforts. Gen. Larry D. Welch,
Air Force chief of staff, contends the B-2 will play a vital role in
America's defense.
   The stealth, so-called because it is intended to be extremely
difficult to detect on enemy radar, has been described as a dark,
tail-less flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar, and
built of exotic composite materials, some of which will absorb radar
rather than reflect it. Air Force officials say it will resemble a
bird on a radar screen.
   Until earlier this year, Northrop was forbidden even to
acknowledge it was developing the bomber.
   The only previous public view of the B-2 was a drawing released
in April, showing what looked like two wings bolted together with no
fuselage or tail. Sources said some details about the plane's design
were deliberately disguised.
   The public may have seen what it thought was the B-2 in recent TV
commercials by American Honda. A mockup of the bomber sitting on an
airfield with an angry red background looms over a small and sleek
black Honda CRX. The life-size mockup was built for an ad agency
based on the Air Force drawing.
   The plane's real public debut at Air Force Plant 42 didn't reveal
much more detail; reporters and photographers had been told in
advance that they wouldn't be allowed closer than 200 feet, and the
plane was never turned so that anything but the front could be seen.
   Today's ceremony for congressional representatives, news media
and aerospace industry insiders followed by three weeks the
Pentagon's release of a photo of another closely held project,
Lockheed Corp.'s stealth fighter, the F-117A.
   For years, the stealth aircraft have been carried as ``black
programs'' with the Pentagon refusing even to acknowledge their
existence.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said recently that the Air
Force was attempting to manipulate the public's fascination with
technology to build good will for new military spending.
   ``We don't know what's right with stealth; we don't know what's
wrong with stealth,'' she said.
   The Union of Concerned Scientists, a private organization, has
issued a report challenging the need for such an expensive weapons
system, saying that it could destabilize arms control because some
of its missions would include destruction of such targets as command
centers and mobile missile sites.
   However, support for the bomber in military spending committees
on Capitol Hill has been bi-partisan, said the Air Force chief of
staff.
   The Air Force said the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.
   Even though it has never left the runway, it is one of the most
carefully tested aircraft ever built because of advanced
manufacturing techniques and computer simulations that evaluated how
the aircraft would perform, Northrop said.
   ``We know more about this airplane before it flew than any other
airplane,'' Daly said. ``It is a remarkable aircraft.''
   Flight tests will begin probably early next year at Edwards Air
Force Base, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave
Desert, the Air Force said.

<TEXT>  of the American Aerospace Industry; By Wayne Biddle; Simon and Schuster, 384
pp., $22.95;  'THERE IS," observed George Bernard Shaw in "Man and Superman,"
"nothing in Man's industrial machinery but his greed and sloth: His heart is
in his weapons.";    So too, it seems, is a lot of profit. Although the
nation's aviation industry was not born of defense contracts, those contracts
account for its survival and growth -- as well as its continued dependence
upon the government, argues Wayne Biddle in this thoroughly researched and
admirably written book. Biddle, a reporter for the New York Times, finds that
the national symbiosis of aviation and government has roots both early and
deep.;    Biddle's focus is upon that close coterie of early aviators,
"self-concocted" individuals -- known to themselves and the public as
"birdmen" -- whose "goal in life was to build airplanes and make money," more
or less in that order. The problem they faced was combining the two.;    A
lunatic thing to do;  The barons -- Glenn Martin, Jack Northrop, Donald
Douglas and Allan and Malcolm Loughead, Scots brothers who later changed their
name to its phonetic spelling, Lockheed -- were a curious and eccentric lot, a
fact that Biddle finds hardly surprising: "Given the bourgeois perception of
flying as a rather lunatic thing to do, aviation turned out to be a gathering
place first for introverted radicals, not for eminent authorities.";    One
eminent authority who aspired to be a birdman was Samuel Langley, secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution and respected astronomer whose 800-pound
"aerodrome," built with $50,000 in federal grant money, ignominiously crashed
through the ice of the Potomac River in December 1903, at the start of its
second and last test flight.;    While Langley lost the race to be the first
man in powered flight to the more entrepreneurial Wright brothers, he achieved
fame of another sort: His airplane was the first to be canceled for poor
performance and cost overruns.;    Drawn to Southern California early in the
century by "balmy weather and adventurous millionaires," the birdmen were an
idealistic band of brothers whose camaraderie stands in stark contrast to the
latter-day cutthroat competition of the aerospace giants that bear their
names.;    Northrop originally designed planes for both Douglas and the
Lockheeds; Martin and Douglas teamed together to build scout planes for the
Army Signal Corps, the first branch of the service to have an air arm. (As a
hedge against starvation, Douglas tried growing potatoes in his back yard.
They failed to come up, and he gave up farming.);    Despite their native
enthusiasm and love of flying, it was initially not clear even to the barons
themselves what the airplane was good for, beyond chasing escaped convicts in
the California desert and carnival barnstorming.;    Sadly, it did not take
them long to find out. In April 1914, Martin entertained the crowd at a Los
Angeles air show by dropping bombs on a mock "forbidden city." The bombs were
actually oranges, and the "city" was blown up by workers detonating
black-powder charges in pre-dug holes near where the fruit landed. "We weren't
taking too much poetic license in dropping oranges," Martin later explained,
"because nobody knew what a bomb ought to look like anyway." This innocence
did not long endure, thanks to the birdmen and their airplanes.;    Martin's
prediction that "the aeroplane will practically decide the war in Europe" was
premature, if not backward. Actually, the war decided the future of the
airplane; the fledgling industry took off. In a fateful sign of things to
come, the head of wartime Washington's aircraft procurement office complained
of "being pestered by every Tom, Dick and Harry who ever built a coffin, a
toilet seat or a chicken coop.";    When business was good, it was very, very
good. Profits for military aircraft during World War I in some cases exceeded
30 percent. However, in a pattern that would become familiar to a later
generation of stockholders, peace brought about a sudden crash landing.;   
That, and the growing sophistication of aircraft, including the switch from
wood to metal and the gradual replacement of seat-of-the-pants intuition by
avionics, caused an explosive increase in expenses that almost swept the
birdmen and their companies from the sky: The cost of the average military
aircraft jumped from $15,641 in 1928 to $39,063 on the eve of the World War
II.;    War bonanza;  Once again, Mars came to the rescue. "The depression
that started in 1929 didn't affect us at all," Douglas boasted. "We weren't
doing any civil work.";    "By the beginnings of the 1930s, the foundation of
their industry was solidly military," Biddle notes. It would remain so, even
in peacetime. Having survived the infamous Nye hearings of the mid-1930s, the
erstwhile "merchants of death" suddenly found themselves hailed as visionary
architects of the arsenal of democracy a few years later, when war clouds once
again formed over Europe.;    "Business is moving very nicely for us and I
believe we are on the eve of an expansion period in aeronautics around the
world that we have all been waiting for," Martin observed -- this time
presciently -- in April 1937. Five days later, German planes bombed Guernica.
In 1939, the U.S. aircraft industry was 41st nationally in terms of dollar
value of output; five years later it was in first place.;    Once again,
however, the industry's dependence upon military production left the aircraft
companies "like whales stranded on a sandbar at ebb tide" with the war's end.
It would take the Cold War to refloat them. With that conflict, too, now
evidently at an end, another shake-out looms.;    There is a kind of tragic
poignancy to the story of the barons. Ultimately, as the industry matured, it
found it could no longer afford the visionaries who had given it birth. By the
time of their deaths, no birdmen remained in control of the companies they
started.;    Short on business sense; Martin, whose company became notorious
for its inability to control costs, was forced out only after he had saddled
his corporation with the cost of his Los Angeles mansion, a 106-foot yacht and
a hunting lodge on Maryland's Eastern Shore.;    Northrop was nearly driven
into bankruptcy by its founder's 30-year-long obsession with a flying wing.
Both the judgment and the authority of Douglas were undermined by his longtime
mistress, whom he raised to top management. The last member of the family to
bear his name was laid off by the company in 1990.;    The Lougheads finally
abandoned the business altogether. Allan sold Florida real estate; Malcolm
made a dubious investment in a gold mine and ended up driving logging trucks.;
   Of all the barons, Jack Northrop met with perhaps the kindest fate. In
1980, unable to speak and confined to a wheelchair by strokes, he was shown
the top-; secret blueprints for the B-2 "Stealth" bomber -- a spitting image
of the flying wing he had tried to sell the government since the mid-1940s. He
died the following year, before the debate had begun over cancellation of the
B-2, believing his vision had been vindicated.  </TEXT>

MONITOR WARDS OFF COLLISIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     On a small television-like screen near the bottom of the jet's instrument
panel, colored electronic symbols showed the other aircraft on what could be a
collision course.;    "Traffic. Traffic," a metallic, female voice announced
in the cockpit. The computer was speaking.;    A small white diamond
representing the traffic drew closer to the chevron symbol of the jetliner in
the center of the screen, then became an amber circle, and finally a red
square as it crossed a ring of symbols marking a range of two miles. The
computer calculated the distance between the aircraft, their speeds and
courses.;    "Descend. Descend. Descend," the metallic voice advised.;    THE
PILOT pulled back the throttle levers for the jet's three engines and lowered
the nose. The plane went down 1,500 feet a minute. Moments later the other
aircraft passed harmlessly 800 feet overhead.;    A collision was avoided in
this demonstration because of a new device called Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System, or TCAS. It is now standard equipment on one of every five
U.S. commercial airliners with 30 seats or more.;    The Federal Aviation
Administration ordered the devices installed on all airliners, including
foreign airliners that fly in the United States, by the end of 1993.;    The
devices are not fail-safe, however.;    On June 30, two jetliners carrying a
total of 194 people at 33,000 feet over North Carolina missed a head-on
collision by less than a mile and a half. The TCAS aboard one plane, a USAir
McDonnell Douglas DC-9, failed to alert the pilots. The other plane, a
Continental Airlines Boeing 727, was not equipped with the device.;    The
TCAS is supposed to work as long as the other plane has the conventional
altitude-reporting transponder required on all commercial airliners.;    The
National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the North Carolina
incident.;    On a recent flight over California aboard the FAA's Boeing 727
jet, however, officials demonstrated TCAS in close encounters with a
twin-engine turboprop aircraft, and it worked just fine.;    The two planes
made a series of head-on passes as well as approaches from the side. Each time
they would have gotten too close, the TCAS ordered the 727 crew to climb or
descend.;    Such a device was first proposed in 1955 after two airliners
collided over the Grand Canyon of Arizona. But research by the airlines and
the federal government hit one dead end after another until 1981, when the FAA
settled on development of TCAS. The system is independent of the ground-based
air-traffic-control system.;    During the 1980s, thousands of computer
simulations were run to find out how to provide the most protection with the
least number of false alarms. Researchers also used the Boeing 727 flight
simulator at NASA/Ames Research Center in Mountain View to find out what
information the system had to provide pilots.;    Here's how TCAS works:;   
The first element is the radar beacon transponder. About 70 percent of the
airplanes in the United States are equipped with these radio devices, which
identify the planes and report their altitudes when they fly into restricted
airspace around the nation's busiest airports.;    The other element is the
TCAS equipment aboard the airliner.;    ONCE A SECOND, it transmits
"interrogation" signals and picks up return signals from transponder-equipped
aircraft out to 16 miles. It watches the skies 1,200 feet above and below the
airplane.;    The TCAS computer tracks the changing range, direction and
altitude of each aircraft in its protected airspace to determine the
intruder's course and speed. The computer also predicts when the other
aircraft will reach its closest point, and decides if it's a threat.;    If
there is a danger, the computer analyzes whether to climb or descend, then
chooses the least disruptive maneuver that also will keep the two airplanes
farthest apart in altitude.;    "You shouldn't be getting into a violent
turn," said Edward Olowacki, FAA project manager on TCAS. "Pilots are very
sensitive to the flying public. They'll just lay it over slowly, and the
passengers won't even know what's going on.";    And if the other aircraft
changes altitude and thwarts the evasive maneuver, the TCAS computer will
advise the pilot whether to increase or decrease the rate of the climb or
descent.;    The computer also considers the aircraft's limited climbing
ability at high altitude or when the wheels are hanging out for landing. It
won't tell the pilot to descend if the plane is less than 1,000 feet above the
ground.;    Only one of the planes need carry the TCAS equipment, which costs
up to $140,000 to purchase and install.;    An advanced model now under
development will tell the pilot to turn left or right as well as up or down to
avoid a collision.  </TEXT>

   Aircraft designer Jack Northrop's dream for more
than three decades was a jet that would combine the flying wing
design with ``stealth'' technology, making it virtually impossible
for enemy radar to detect. The B-2 stealth bomber flew its maiden
voyage this summer, and the pending decision on whether to begin
full-scale production will help determine the face of American air
power into the next century.

   Jack Northrop, the aircraft designer and
founder of the California company bearing his name, was obsessed
with the flying wing. But for more than three decades, the Air Force
shunned it as a flight of fancy.
   Then, in the end, it embraced Northrop's dream to build the B-2
``Stealth'' bomber, the world's most expensive airplane at current
estimates of $530 million apiece.
   Now Congress must decide whether the United States can afford to
build a plane the military says it can't afford to do without.
   Northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of the
flying wing _ chiefly, its reduced liklihood of being detected by
radar _ as a side benefit, a nice selling point to the military, for
what he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane. A
flying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventional
airplane of the same weight. It therefore is more efficient, meaning
it requires less power and less fuel, and can carry a greater
payload.
   ``Any reasonable assumptions,'' Northrop said in 1947, ``will
always result in advantage to the all-wing configuration, of such
magnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations may
be involved in its development.''
   In 1981, as the headlines focused on Ronald Reagan's resurrection
of the B-1 program canceled by Jimmy Carter, Jack Northrop, then
retired and near death, was given a special security clearance so
Pentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34
years earlier. The Air Force had finally contracted with the company
bearing his name to build a flying wing as the nation's flagship
strategic bomber.
   Long before the public got its first glimpse of the B-2, Air
Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch declared that ``the aerodynamic
design ... is markedly more efficient than that of its
predecessors.'' The B-2, he continued, ``requires far fewer tankers
... and carries a very healthy bomb load. It would be a superb
bomber even if it weren't stealthy.''
   Aside from military considerations, some aviation buffs are
rooting for full development and production of the B-2 because of
its potential spin-offs for commercial flight. According to Tim
Wooldridge of the National Air and Space Museum, airlines and air
transport companies have long flirted with the notion of an all-wing
design for ``span-loaders'' that could fly tremendous distances
carrying huge weights _ oil, for example. ``But nobody's willing to
bet the billions of dollars it would cost'' for feasibility
research, he notes. ``What airline would bet that kind of money?''
   To some in Congress, the billions that will be needed to build a
fleet of B-2's look like a questionable bet, as well.
   By current estimates, each one will cost about $530 million. Put
another way, a single B-2 will cost $100 million more than Toronto's
spectacular Skydome, the world's newest and fanciest sports stadium,
replete with hotel, restaurants and retractable roof. The extra $100
million would buy a major league baseball team.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``Members of Congress are balking at
spending $4.1 billion this year for the Strategic Defense
Initiative. It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much
per year on a plane.''
   ``This was the worst kind of public policy,'' said Rep. John R.
Kasich, R-Ohio. ``To keep something secret all this time and drive
the cost up to $22 billion (to date) will never be tolerated again.''
   The Air Force rejects such criticism, suggesting that some
members of Congress are being coy with their constituents now that
the cost estimates are public after eight years of top-secret
development. ``The charge that someone was hiding anything from the
Congress is ludicrous,'' said Larry Welch, the Air Force chief of
staff. ``There were dozens and dozens of people in the Congress who
were fully aware of all the details.''
   But Rep. Myke Synar, D-Okla, said, ``I attended classified
briefings by the Air Force and by Northrop which frankly left a lot
to be desired. They were not straightforward, they were not candid
and, in many ways, they were very confusing.''
   Synar charged that Northrop had ``miserably failed to manage this
program.'' Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello
agreed, saying he had ``serious and grave concerns'' about
Northrop's management, and that the firm's quality controls were
``terrible.''
   Northrop's chairman, Thomas V. Jones, vigorously defended the
company and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders, saying the
program had produced an ``extraordinary new aircraft system'' and
``unprecedented technical successes.''
   The nation's first B-2 bomber made its public debut this summer,
18 months later than scheduled. It taxied slowly from its hanger at
Northrop's plant in Palmdale, Calif., and turned onto runway 04 the
morning of July 17. Chief Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, who
hadn't been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for the
honor, ran up the plane's four General Electric engines and released
the brakes at 9:36 a.m. EDT. Twenty-three seconds later, the B-2 was
airborne.
   ``The aircraft was very stable; rock stable,'' Hinds reported
later. ``It's going to be a very easy airplane to fly.''
   But not to sell. Before the August congressional recess, the
House limited B-2 production to two planes next year and two the
year after that _ half what the Bush administration wants. It also
ordered the Pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper production
program. The Senate was kinder; it trimmed only $300 million from
the $4.7 billion sought by the president for the B-2 next year. A
compromise bill may be crafted next month.
   Meanwhile, the Air Force has scrambled to redefine the B-2's
mission and capability. Originally conceived as a purely strategic
bomber to seek out and destroy the Soviet Union's mobile missiles in
a nuclear war, it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfire
weapon as well.
   Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command,
argues that the B-2 would have been ideal, had it been available,
for the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya. ``Just three to four B-2s could
have done the job directly from stateside bases,'' Randolph said.
   That's a remarkable switch in Air Force thinking. When the raid
was planned by a young Marine lieutenant colonel named Oliver North,
he inquired about having the already operational F-117A stealth
fighter-bomber do the job, according to Bill Sweetman, a noted
aviation writer and author of ``Stealth Bomber.''
   The Air Force turned North down cold, saying the plane was too
valuable to risk on such a venture.
   The question arises: if that is true of the F-117, thought to
cost about $100 million per plane, why wouldn't it be true of the
B-2, at more than half a billion dollars?

<HEAD>Tilt-Rotor V-22 Osprey Makes Emergency Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental tilt-rotor aircraft
designed to hover like a helicopter and fly like an airplane made
an emergency landing Monday after one of two engines failed, a
spokesman said.
   The V-22 Osprey lost power in its left engine, but was able to
return safely to Arlington Municipal Airport, said Terry Arnold,
spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.
   No injuries or damage to the prototype aircraft were reported
after the 10 a.m. malfunction in the skies about 40 miles southwest
of downtown Dallas, Arnold said.
   ``Actually, we're pleased, because the aircraft did what it was
supposed to do,'' Arnold said. ``The other engine engaged the shaft
and drove both rotor systems and we landed without incident. It was
designed to do just that.''
   Arnold said it was the first emergency landing on record for the
V-22. The cause of the malfunction was not immediately known.
   The Osprey can hover and land like a helicopter but also flies
at up to 340 mph as a fixed-wing airplane _ much faster than a
helicopter. Large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for
vertical flight and rotate forward for the long haul.
   Arnold said the aircraft, one of four Osprey prototypes, was in
``airplane mode'' when the engine failed.
   It flew in ``airplane mode'' back to the airport, where it
swooped down and landed like a helicopter, said Bob Leder, another
Bell Helicopter Textron spokesman.
   The four prototypes are among six Ospreys for which the Pentagon
has contracted.
   The Defense Department has spent $2 billion to develop the V-22
Osprey and its predecessor, the XV-15, for military use. But
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to end funding in favor of
conventional helicopter development.

In 1927, Elrey (Jepp) Jeppesen borrowed $500, bought an old Army surplus JN4 
"Jenny" biplane, quit high school and went barnstorming with a flying circus. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years he had flown the first aerial surveys of then-uncharted 
Mexico. He went on to survive dangerous night-mail routes over the Rockies and 
Northwest, and he later became an airline captain into the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his air navigation charts that won him both a fortune and a place in 
the national Aviation Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Leffler, who founded the Museum of Flight at Seattle, once said the museum 
traces the history of flight from "Leonardo da Vinci to E. B. Jeppesen. . . . 
Jepp's work has saved a lot of lives. People who didn't use his charts ran into 
mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Now 83, Jeppesen, the shy son of Danish immigrants, looks back on that Golden 
Age of aviation from his home in an exclusive Cherry Hills estate area. 
</P>
<P>
"It was magical for me. I can't hardly believe it ever existed," he said. 
"Those old open airplanes -- you felt like a bird, a part of the airplane. . . 
. It was so damn much fun. You could feel the wind on your face, the wind on 
the stick and the rudder. You were part of it. Today, you just might as well 
get on a train." 
</P>
<P>
A strong sense of survival prompted Jeppesen's first chart book, a tiny 
hand-size loose-leaf ring binder. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation was to learn the routes real fast, to try to remember all these 
things," he said of his days as a night-mail pilot. "I started writing them 
down and making sketches. We followed railroad tracks (called 'hugging the UP' 
or Union Pacific) and highways. We needed to know the size of the fields, where 
they were, obstructions" -- such as smokestacks, water towers, power lines, 
trees, mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the outhouses faced south. If your compass went out and you could find 
an outhouse, you could find out what direction you were going." 
</P>
<P>
Jeppesen's little black notebook became the granddaddy of the Jeppesen Airway 
Manual, first published in 1933. It sold for $10 and included landing-approach 
procedures for 50 airfields between Chicago and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Jeppesen confirmed his information by driving the entire distance by car, 
climbing mountains and smokestacks and water towers with altimeters strapped on 
his back. He obtained additional information from city and county engineers, 
surveyors and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Jeppesen Airway Manuals are used by all U.S. airlines, many foreign 
carriers and two-thirds of all instrument-rated pilots. 
</P>
<P>
When instrument flying was introduced during the mid-1930s, Jeppesen updated 
his black book to show pilots how to follow radio beacons, mileage reference 
charts and terrain elevation profiles. 
</P>
<P>
He believed instrument flying was the only way to develop aviation into a 
reliable form of transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the outbreak of World War II, I had the whole United States covered. I gave 
50 of the manuals to the military," he said, and secured contracts with both 
the Navy and Army air wings. 
</P>
<P>
His aviation navigation chart business began as a moonlighting business with 
the help of his wife, Nadine, a United Airlines stewardess he met and married 
in 1936. They worked from their basement in homes in Cheyenne, Wyo.; Salt Lake 
City and Denver as United moved Jeppesen around during his commercial pilot 
career. The Jeppesens hired college students as draftsmen and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1954 in Denver, the stress of two full-time jobs became too much. 
Under doctors' orders, Jeppesen retired from commercial flying at the age of 
47. 
</P>
<P>
When he sold his Denver-based air navigation chart company in 1961, it was 
grossing $5 million a year and had more than 200 employees. Today it employs 
840 people worldwide and grosses $80 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Jeppesen launched his long aviation career as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I never finished high school. I soloed (with just two hours and 15 minutes 
flying time) and bought this Jenny for $500 -- borrowed most of it from people 
on my paper route (in Odell, Ore.). I got in the airplane and just never got 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been sleeping in the hangar, gassing engines, going barnstorming with the 
older guys, doing a little wing-walking," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to take this old Jenny up to about 5,000 feet over the Columbia River 
and make long slow loops all the way down. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"The hum of the engine had a lot to do with it, the noise of the propeller -- 
it all glued together for a sensation you certainly can't enjoy today on an 
airliner," Jeppesen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the Jenny for barnstorming. They called it a flying circus. Two or 
three of us would get our planes and go into a town, do some stunts to attract 
the people . . . then charge them $10-$20 for a 15-minute ride." 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, he landed a job with Royal Dutch Shell Oil flying English aerial 
photographer Sidney Bonnick on a pictorial survey of then-uncharted Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
He was the 27th pilot to be licensed in Oregon, the 31st in Mexico and his 
Federation Aeronautique International pilot license is No. 7034, dated Jan. 29, 
1929, and signed by Orville Wright. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, he began flying the night mail -- it paid twice as much as flying by 
day -- for Varney Airlines at Portland, and then joined Boeing Air Transport. 
Both companies later merged to become United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
On the mail runs in Wyoming, he remembers the wind so strong against the puny 
power of the plane that sometimes he'd be flying backward. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the mail early in the 1930s was flying by the seat of your pants, 
Jeppesen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We guided mostly on terrain features and dead reckoning. We flew anywhere from 
50 to 300 feet" above the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to start learning fast. Anytime somebody got sick or killed, they'd say, 
'Send Jepp over there -- he's only got a suitcase and no family.' I got to fly 
a lot of runs that way." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the 18 pilots on the Oakland to Cheyenne run were killed in the winter 
of 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the night mail in a cold open cockpit, with ice on the wings, "You just 
staggered along. The prop would throw ice off and it would crash against the 
fuselage like a rifle bullet. The ice would get on the wing wires and vibrate 
and snap like a gunshot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
His bright blue eyes looked far away as that era seemed to fly past his mind in 
review. 
</P>
<P>
"The most fun was barnstorming," he said. "God, I'd love to do it all again."

   Lockheed Corp. on Wednesday unveiled its
version of a futuristic fighter proposed for the 21st century, as
Air Force officials cited the Middle East crisis as the need for
such a craft.
   The Lockheed YF-22 prototype of the Advanced Tactical Fighter
followed Monday's launch of a prototype made by Northrop Corp. The
two designs are competing for a multibillion-dollar contract.
   The plane Lockheed unveiled at its Palmdale manufacturing plant
was much more compact than the Northrop version.
   Both planes have smooth contours to help them evade radar and
are built of advanced composite materials. The Lockheed aircraft
has stubby wings, while the Northrop plane is longer, with a
cigar-like fuselage and a wingspan that looks like a kite.
   A music system blared Wagner's ``Flight of the Valkyries'' as
the Lockheed plane was rolled out, although unlike its competition,
the YF-22 stayed on the ground after its rollout. Officials would
not say when it would be flown.
   Lockheed chairman Daniel M. Tellep said it will not matter that
Northrop got its aircraft up first.
   ``It is not he who flies first, it is he who flies best,'' he
said.
   The contract calls for 750 fighter planes for the Air Force and
approximately 500 for the Navy at a cost of $51 million apiece. The
price tag is about twice the cost of the F-15 Eagle, the current
front-line fighter deployed in the Middle East.
   The ATF program faced fading prospects for approval in Congress
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, but the crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense projects.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Ralston said he is optimistic
about congessional funding for the ATF program desspite recent
defense spending cuts.
   In building the YF-22 prototype, Lockheed teamed with the Boeing
Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. Northrop teamed with McDonnell
Douglas Corp. for its test version of the futuristic fighter.
   The winner must give the Pentagon a fighter plane that can fly
twice the speed of sound, is highly maneuverable and uses
radar-evading stealth technology.
   If Northrop gets the contract, ATF planes will be built in
Southern California. Lockheed has said if it wins the competition,
the fighters will be made in Marietta, Ga.

<HEAD>Southwest Airlines Report Features Punch-Out Fun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In addition to the facts and figures formally
found in a firm's annual report, Southwest Airlines Co. 1988
features fun, in the form of a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the
most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said Tim
McClure, executive creative director of Austin advertising agency
GSD&amp;M, which designed the report.
   The booklet, besides reporting on Southwest's record $57.95
million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from
the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble
Shamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out last year
during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks in Texas
and California.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas will
want one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of Shamu One.
   On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusually
painted plane, with assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint:''
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(Shamu One's, not his).''
   Even though Southwest previously has taken a light approach to
its reports, McClure said it was a little difficult this year to
sell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, ``once someone
punches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.''
   He said he persuaded Southwest that the unusual idea would
become enticing. ``Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call up
for one.''
   ``I think it's a delightful brochure and something that really
shows the personality that Southwest is,'' McClure said.
   Southwest, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people,
is based at Love Field near downtown Dallas and operates a
distinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.

<BYLINE>Air Force Makes Public First Drawing of `Flying Wing'
^By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted
together without any fuselage in the center. The Air Force says
that's the general shape of the new Stealth bomber.
   Piercing a decade of official secrecy, the Air Force on
Wednesday released an artist's drawing of its newest strategic
bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later
this fall.
   The service also acknowledged the program was suffering some
cost overruns and that a new estimate would have to be released
later this year.
   ``Some cost growth is to be expected in any development program
that is on the leading edge of technology like the B-2,'' the Air
Force said, using the bomber's official military designation.
   ``But the acquisition of the B-2 ensures our capability to
effectively penetrate Soviet defenses well into the 21st century.''
   The Stealth bomber is so named because it is designed to fly
without showing up on radar. While the Air Force has flatly refused
to discuss the bomber since design work began in the 1970s, its
general shape has actually been known since 1985 when former
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater disclosed its resemblance to a
``flying wing.''
   The drawing distributed by the Air Force Wednesday shows an
airplane that to some extent resembles a boomerang. A small cockpit
rises in the middle on top and inlets for the jet engines are
placed to each side of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The design allows the aircraft to be made without any sharp or
right angles. According to Pentagon sources, the plane also relies
on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and
composite materials for construction.
   The design has long been the object of experimentation by the
Northrop Corp., which is building the B-2 for the Air Force. The
company flew a propeller-driven version of such a plane, known as
the XB-35, in 1946.
   A jet-powered version, the YB-49, first flew in late 1947 and
was tested by the Air Force. But the service never purchased any of
the planes, and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the
early 1950s.
   The Air Force declined Wednesday to give a precise date for the
maiden flight, saying only that it would occur ``this fall'' and
involve a short hop from the manufacturing plant at Palmdale,
Calif., to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``As the first flight approaches, many actions associated with
preparations for that flight can best be accomplished in the open,
without compromising program security,'' the service said in
explaining its relaxation of secrecy.
   Details of such things as performance characteristics, crew size
and maximum payload remain classified, however, the Air Force said.
Indeed, some of the details about the plane's design _ for example,
the placement of the engine exhaust outlets _ have been
deliberately masked in the artist's rendering, service sources said.
   The Air Force did acknowledge, however, the plane is going to
cost more than originally projected.
   ``While the acquisition of 132 B-2 bombers was originally
estimated to cost $36.6 billion in 1981 dollars, the Air Force is
re-evaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current
and projected fiscal constraints,'' the service said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, lauded the Air Force for releasing more information
about the plane, saying the public needs to learn about ``a
revolutionary addition to our nuclear deterrent.''
   He predicted the bomber ``will render obsolete billions of
dollars of Soviet investment in their current air defense.''

   The American public will get its first look at
the new Stealth bomber just after the presidential election, and
the plane will make its maiden flight a short time later, the Air
Force said Thursday.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said the Stealth,
designated the B-2, won't fly on the day of its public unveiling in
California, but preparations for flight will be very close to
completion by then. New planes often don't fly until several months
after they are first presented to the public.
   Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, denied Thursday the plane's
unveiling purposely had been set for after the November elections.
   Democratic members of Congress have cautioned the Defense
Department not to make an election-year issue out of the new
bomber, as was done with the B-1B. Both Democrat Michael Dukakis
and Republican George Bush have said they support the new plane.
   The bomber is an unusually short plane because of its unique
``flying wing'' design and will take only two personnel to fly,
reflecting the sophistication of the new technology that has gone
into its development, the service added. The B-52 bomber requires a
crew of six and the new B-1B bomber is flown by a crew of four.
   The Air Force said in a statement the plane would be powered by
four General Electric Co. jet engines. The engine, dubbed the
F-118, will be a derivative of an existing GE powerplant and not
any type of revolutionary new design, the service said.
   The Air Force offered those details about its newest bomber in
announcing that final ``checkout activities'' on the first plane
had begun and that assembly of a second was well along.
   ``The B-2 will roll out in mid-November at Air Force Plant 42 in
Palmdale, Calif,'' the statement said. The exact date was not given.
   The B-2 has been under development for more than a decade under
a shroud of secrecy with Northrop Corp. as the prime contractor.
Thursday's statement was only the second time the Air Force has
disclosed information about the plane. It released an artist's
sketch last April.
   The Stealth bomber takes its nickname from the fact it is
designed to fly without showing up on radar.
   It resembles a ``flying wing'' in shape, without a conventional
fuselage in the center. A small cockpit bubble rises on top of the
flying wing, and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side
of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The B-2 will stand about 17 feet high, 69 feet long and have a
wingspan of about 172 feet, the service said.
   In addition to GE, subcontractors included the Boeing Advanced
Systems Co., LTV Aircraft Products Group, Hughes Aircraft Radar
System Group and Honeywell.
   The Link Flight Simulation Corp. is responsible for aircrew
training devices and the Boeing Military Airplane Co. will build
the B-2's bomb and missile launcher system, the service added.
   While offering some new information, the Air Force said Thursday
it still was not prepared to publish the current cost estimate for
the Stealth fleet.
   Published reports have suggested overruns have pushed the
pricetag up more than 20 percent to about $450 million per plane.

NOTE _ In coming months, Congress must decide whether the B-2 ``stealth
bomber,'' the most expensive plane ever designed and built, is a weapon
the United States can't afford to do without, or simply can't afford. Yet
for all the secrecy surrounding this high-tech marvel, the ideas behind
it are, by aviation standards, almost ancient history.    ___</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   It rests, in pieces, in a grimy corner of a
museum warehouse in suburban Silver Hill, Md., long forgotten by the
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable
bomber in the skies.
   Re-assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or a
stub-tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that the
enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet-powered flying wing's
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves,
rather than reflect them.
   No, the Northrop B-2 bomber, the world's most expensive airplane,
hasn't already become a dust-gathering relic _ although some
critics, convinced the albatross is the only sea-creature to which
it should be compared, wish that were so.
   The astonishing lookalike in Silver Hill is indeed a stealth
warplane, but it was secretly built and test-flown 45 years ago by
Nazi Germany.
   For all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word ``stealth''
since it was introduced to the U.S. military vocabulary in 1980, the
B-2 and such radar-evading relatives as the F-117A fighter represent
concepts which, by aviation standards, are almost ancient.
   The B-2 has been financed, until this year, out of the Pentagon's
mysterious ``black'' budget. For eight years, the taxpayers spent
$22.4 billion without knowing it, and without knowing what they were
getting for it.
   What they got, when it was finally nosed heavenward in July, was
a strange, plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably
won't fly much higher, much farther or any faster than the Strategic
Air Command's old reliable, the B-52.
   The B-2 is 17 feet tall, 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172
feet. It is powered by four General Electric F-118 engines,
virtually the same engines as used on the F-14 fighter but without
afterburners. Its range is 6,900 miles without refueling, and 11,500
miles with one midair refueling. It will have a maximum takeoff
weight of 350,000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of
bombs or missiles, nuclear or conventional, 10,000 pounds less than
the B-52. Private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to
55,000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 0.8 to 0.85, or about 530-560
mph.
   There's nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers.
What is dazzling, presumably, is the stuff the Air Force won't talk
about _ the stealth technology, computerized flight controls,
``quiet'' on-board radar, and other electronic systems, possibly
employing fiber optics, designed to withstand the electromagnetic
interference generated by nuclear blasts.
   The Air Force wants to spend an additional $50 billion or so to
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company, Northrop, which for
years hadn't made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter, the
F-5.
   Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello, who left as
undersecretary of defense in May, wanted to scuttle the program. In
an interview with The Washington Post, he said he told then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci last year that ``it's being brought to you
by the same company that brought you'' a series of troubled
programs, including guidance systems for the MX and air-launched
cruise missiles. ``What makes you think they'll do better (with the
B-2)?''
   Eight days after the B-2's maiden flight July 17, Pentagon and
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by
the Justice Department's fraud unit concerning Northrop's billing
practices on the project. The company said it was unaware of the
probe.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones says without reservation that
the B-2 is an ``extraordinary'' success. Defense Secretary Richard
B. Cheney calls it ``absolutely vital'' to strategic deterrence.
President Bush says doing without it would be ``devastating'' to
arms-control negotiations with the Soviets.
   The security and secrecy surrounding the project have been
phenomenal, perhaps rivaled only by elements of the Star Wars
program and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb in
World War II. Northrop removed it from the rest of its own
organization, forming a new division called Advanced Products and
housing it at a closed auto plant in Pico Rivera, Calif. It
surrounded the plant, as well as the sister assembly complex at
Palmdale, Calif., with fences topped by razor wire.
   According to Costello, security has accounted for 5 percent of
the costs to date. With more than $22.4 billion spent so far, that
amounts to more than $1 billion.
   The tight security imposed additional costs. Efficiency suffered
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didn't know
what their subordinates were doing. ``I couldn't even ask,'' one
former Northrop official told the Los Angeles Times last year. ``For
all I knew, they were going to the movies every day.''
   Some could have. When employees were hired, they could not go
directly to work until their security clearances were finished. Many
were assigned for weeks to make-work jobs in an area of the plant
they nicknamed the ``drunk tank.''
   Unbeknownst to the public, the biggest snag occurred halfway
through the seven-year design period when the Air Force changed its
mind about the B-2's mission. The Pentagon originally ordered a
high-altitude bomber. Now it wanted one that could penetrate at low
levels as well, probably because it was fearful the Soviet Union was
developing the same new radar technology, called OTHB for Over the
Horizon Backscatter. The still super-secret radar system, the
Pentagon has privately acknowledged, offers new possibilities for
detecting stealth airplanes, though it is said to be ineffective
within 500 miles.
   Northrop's designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower
altitudes, where turbulence is greater. That took a year and another
$1 billion. An additional six-month delay was necessary for other
design changes, related especially to the engine inlets. In 1987,
two years before Congress began public debate over funding for the
B-2, the Pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years
in the face of Gramm-Rudman budget restrictions. Cheney has
postponed production yet another year; the Pentagon now hopes to
build all 132 planes by 1999, versus the original target of 1995.

FIVE MUSEUMS GIVE WINGS TO THE FLIGHT FANS' FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
David G. Price says his fascination with airplanes started when he was 7 years 
old. He lived half a block from what was then known as Clover Field and today 
is Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It was during World War II and I used to go over to the field and watch the 
airplanes take off," says Price, 56, president of the new Museum of Flying. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were from England and as a little boy, I'd dream of flying 
Spitfires," he recalls. His dream came true: He eventually became a Navy pilot, 
and four years ago, he flew a Spitfire over the hedgerows and green fields of 
England. He purchased that Spitfire and another and brought them to Santa 
Monica Airport, where, after talks with Donald Douglas Jr., the idea of a new 
Museum of Flying was conceived. 
</P>
<P>
On the same site where Donald Douglas Sr. once built airplanes, the museum is 
part of an ultramodern complex adjoining the DC-3 restaurant and Supermarine, a 
fixed-base operator that services private aircraft at the Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Flying is one of five major air/aerospace museums in Southern 
California, where aerospace is a key part of the economy. Although operating 
independently, the museums are united in their reverence for vintage aircraft 
and frequently cooperate on restoration projects or loan planes to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Two museums, the Aerospace Hall at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry in Los Angeles and the Aerospace Historical Center in San Diego, trace 
flight from its beginnings into the Space Age. A fourth, the March Field Museum 
at the Air Force base near Riverside, is a military museum as well as a flying 
museum. And a fifth, Planes of Fame in Chino, offers a nostalgic look at famous 
"Warbirds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Douglas Artifacts Used 
</P>
<P>
Many artifacts from the Donald Douglas Museum were incorporated into the Museum 
of Flying, including furnishings from Douglas' boardroom with more than 60 
models of Douglas aircraft. Also, there is the drafting table where he created 
the likes of the New Orleans, a Douglas World Cruiser now hanging from the 
museum's ceiling, along with several other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Other Douglas planes on display include a DC-2, a DC-3 (widely acclaimed as one 
of the greatest aircraft ever built), a 1951 Navy AD-6 Skyraider bomber, an 
A-26 Invader bomber and a Douglas A-4 combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Price's British Spitfires also are on display. His Mk XIV served in the Indian 
Air Force and was rescued derelict from an Indian airfield in 1978. His Mk IX 
was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Force in Casablanca and may be the last 
surviving Spitfire that flew with American colors. 
</P>
<P>
A Curtiss JN-4D "Jenny" hangs over a display and video exhibit on wing-walkers 
of the post-World War I era when many Americans were introduced to airplanes 
through barnstormers at carnival-type air shows. 
</P>
<P>
Early air exhibits at the Aerospace Hall of the California Museum of Science 
and Industry include an airworthy replica of the Wright Brothers' Model B 
aircraft. The craft was used in a 1978 television movie, "Winds of Kitty Hawk." 
Later aircraft include a T-38 on loan from the Air Force, a DC-3, a DC-8 and a 
police helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
However, a major emphasis at this museum is space exploration. From Aug. 21 to 
Aug. 29, for instance, the Aerospace Hall will present live photos broadcast 
from Voyager II as it passes Neptune before leaving the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pictures Relayed to Museum 
</P>
<P>
"These will be the first close-up pictures we have of Neptune," says Eugene 
Harrison Ph.D., aerospace curator. "The satellite will transmit the data back 
to Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will turn around 
and broadcast what it is receiving via satellite. . . . Visitors to the museum 
will be seeing Neptune at the same time as the scientists at JPL." 
</P>
<P>
Special exhibits through Sept. 4 include "Visions of Space," 25 years of the 
space-probe photos recorded by JPL, and "Apollo 11 Revisited," a special 
tribute to the July 20, 1969, moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerospace Historical Center in San Diego also has space exhibits, including 
mock-ups of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space capsules. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits are arranged chronologically and start with a replica of a Wright 
Brothers plane, followed by World War I-era planes and a replica of Charles 
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Mail to War 
</P>
<P>
"We have an excellent exhibit on early airmail," says William Immenschuh, 
president of the San Diego museum board, "a barnstorming exhibit and airplanes 
of the '30s." These are followed by planes for sport flying and a special 
exhibit honoring the Flying Tigers for their activities in China during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Military buffs may enjoy a mock-up of a portion of the deck of the U.S. 
aircraft carrier Yorktown, a 1940s-era ship. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk onto the deck of the carrier and there are some American airplanes 
and a Japanese Zero and the ready room and the bridge of the carrier," 
Immenschuh says. 
</P>
<P>
Military buffs will also enjoy a trip to the March Field Museum. Originally a 
pilot training base, March later was a base for combat-unit training, a World 
War II fighter and bomber crew training base and a Strategic Air Command 
installation. It is now home for the 15th Air Force and SAC bomber and tanker 
units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey of Eras 
</P>
<P>
The museum reflects these various eras, from inside exhibits like the trainer 
"Jennies" to a U-2 spy plane out on the flight line. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits inside include a P-59 (one of the first military jets), a B-1 jet 
engine split in half and positioned on opposite sides of the aisle, a ball 
turret that carried the belly gunner on a B-17 bomber, models of planes and 
missiles, cut-aways of engines, flight suits and other uniforms and other 
vintage planes. 
</P>
<P>
A full-size, cut-away cockpit of a B-47 used in the movie "Strategic Air 
Command" offers an inside view of this plane that was based at March through 
the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
From the museum, visitors can take a bus out to the "flight line" and see 31 
vintage aircraft, including the F-4, F-105, F-89, B-52, B-24, B-17, T-38, 0-2, 
B-47 and KC-97. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of all those airplanes are tied into March Air Force Base in one 
way or another," says Senior Master Sgt. Stephen P. Condos, director of the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Planes in Chino 
</P>
<P>
Military planes are also the foundation of the Planes of Fame at the Chino 
Airport. Sixty rare planes are crowded into two hangars, one additional 
building and surrounding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
A special exhibit of World War II Japanese aircraft includes a Mitsubishi 
A6M5-Zero, believed to be the only flying Zero fighter left, and a rare 
kamikaze suicide device, the OHKA-11, which was basically a piloted bomb. The 
OHKA-11 used rocket fuel and was carried by a mother plane and released a few 
miles short of the target. 
</P>
<P>
German warplanes include the Stormbird, a 1942 jet-powered ME-262A-1a Luftwaffe 
Messerschmitt and the Volksjager (People's Fighter), a Heinkel HE-162A-1 jet 
flown in the last days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's Soviet planes -- a MIG-15 and a MIG-17, which were acquired 
through a broker from Poland, and a 1947 biplane -- currently are the center of 
a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says the planes must be 
surrendered to Customs or sold to a U.S. military facility because they were 
purchased in violation of regulations forbidding transportation of military 
equipment from certain countries. Museum officials believe they have not done 
anything wrong and have negotiated a five-month reprieve to resolve the 
problem, according to John Maloney, a vice president of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Planes 
</P>
<P>
American planes displayed include a 1944 Ryan FR-1 Fireball -- with a 
combination of reciprocating (piston) and jet-power plants -- and an RB-26C 
Invader used in Korea. The Invader sports a Black Birds emblem lettered with 
the motto of reconnaissance crews: "Alone! Unarmed! Unafraid!" 
</P>
<P>
Fighter Rebuilders, a private company that restores the museum's planes in 
addition to private planes, works on the premises, and visitors can peer into 
the hangar. 
</P>
<P>
Locating parts is sometimes a challenge and often expensive, according to 
Maloney, who is also the restoration foreman. 
</P>
<P>
David Price says his Spitfires were "in pretty good shape" when he bought them, 
but previous owners had spent thousands of staff hours building them from 
"rusting hulks." 
</P>
<P>
But Price feels the end result is well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prime hope is that (people) get excited about what their predecessors 
created," Price says, "so when they leave they can say, 'You know, maybe I can 
do something like that too.' " 
</P>

Transcontinental Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A solar-powered airplane is slowly nearing
the end of its wind-tossed odyssey from California to Kitty Hawk,
N.C., the birthplace of powered flight.
   After more than six weeks, sometimes being blown the wrong way,
aviator Eric Raymond still has about 240 miles to go in his
198-pound plane, Sun Seeker. But strong headwinds appear to have
dashed his hopes of reaching Kitty Hawk during the Labor Day
weekend, said his wife, Aida.
   ``He's getting desperate to get there. He just wants to finish
the flight,'' Mrs. Raymond said in a telephone interview Friday.
   Meanwhile, the welcome mat is out where Orville and Wilbur
Wright piloted a motor-powered airplane for the first time in 1903.
   ``There's a lot of excitement here,'' said Nancy McWilliams,
spokeswoman for Kitty Hawk Kites, a hang glider school planning a
reception for Raymond's arrival. ``It's been the talk of the town
for the last month. Wherever I go, people say, `Where's Eric?
When's Eric arriving?'''
   Raymond, 33, a former national hang gliding champion had logged
only 18 miles for the day when he landed Friday afternoon at
Virginia Tech Airport at Blacksburg, Va., about 25 miles west of
Roanoke, Va.
   ``We've been very upset because the delays we've had on this
trip have had nothing to do with the plane, they were because of
the weather,'' Mrs. Raymond said.
   ``We thought he was going to land at Kitty Hawk on Sunday,'' she
said. ``Now the weather forecast is saying the strong headwinds
will keep up for another four days after today and he may not be
able to fly until they stop.
   ``The weather forecast has been so wrong all along, we're just
hoping it'll be wrong again,'' she said.
   When Raymond took off from the New River Valley Airport in
Virginia on Friday, he had 260 miles to go, and had logged 2,168
miles in 102 hours and 35 minutes in the air.
   On Thursday, he braved the Appalachians, gaining 132 miles
before landing about 35 miles west of Roanoke.
   It was July 16 when Raymond first took off from Desert Center,
beginning his quest to prove an ultralight aircraft partially
powered by solar energy could cross the United States.
   Rather than set a flying record, Raymond wants to show solar
power's usefulness, said trip spokesman Jack Whitehouse. The plane
has solar cells on its surfaces to run an electrical motor that
turns its propeller.
   The motor is used for takeoffs and landings. After takeoff, the
motor is turned off and the plane rides the thermals like an
ultralight glider.
   Two days after the sojourn began, the craft was seriously
damaged in an aborted takeoff from Lordsburg, N.M.
   Raymond and his ground crew brought the craft back by land to
Lake Elsinore for repairs. Raymond manufactured and sold hang
gliding equipment there until six months ago, when he devoted
himself to the Sun Seeker project.
   The Sun Seeker had better luck after taking off again from
Desert Center on Aug. 2.
   Although the craft hasn't crashed since, strong headwinds and
rain along the way have made for slow going.
   In the month since, the Sun Seeker has remained grounded on
eight days because of bad weather. One day the craft was forced to
land after strong headwinds pushed it backwards.
