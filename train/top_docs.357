   Brazilian officials, vowing not to be
pressured by economic interests, have promised to stem the
widespread burning of Amazon jungle that already has destroyed an
area larger than California.
   President Jose Sarney has unveiled a plan aimed mainly at
stopping uncontrolled forest burning by farmers and ranchers.
   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said
Wednesday in a ceremony announcing the program. ``The era of
unlimited natural resources is over.''
   The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to
government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle
ranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed
tropical timber.
   Environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast Amazon
tracts by the primitive slash-and-burn method has released hundreds
of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere.
   They say this is contributing to the greenhouse effect, the
gradual warming of the Earth's atmosphere by a concentration of
pollutants that act like a blanket, trapping the sun's warmth.
   Brazil's government-run Space Research Institute said about
77,000 square miles of land were cleared by the slash-and-burn
method in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year.
   The program also includes a recommendation to Brazil's Congress
to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold prospectors throughout the
Amazon use the highly toxic element to separate gold from river
silt and then throw the waste into the water.
   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economic
interests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil's
federal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carry
it out.''
   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the impoverished
Amazon Basin, which covers an area equal to roughly two-thirds of
the continental United States, permitted land developers to burn
off 50 percent of their properties _ the fastest and cheapest way
to clear land _ and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.
   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of
land-clearing in the Brazilan Amazon has destroyed 240,000 square
miles of natural tropical rainforest cover, an area larger than
California.
   Interior Minister Joao Alves said the tax break suspensions were
temporary, because the government is working out a plan to
determine which parts of the Amazon can be used for farming and
ranching and which must be left alone.
   Private developers complained about the plan even before it was
announced.
   Orlando Mariutti, who has three projects on a total of 136,000
acres in the western state of Mato Grosso, told the newspaper Folha
de S. Paulo that ``Cutting tax incentives will hold back
development of the Amazon.''
   Large developers in the region, he said, ``generally preserve
more than the 50 percent of the land required by law.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The government of Brazil this month announced an
environmental plan aimed primarily at slowing the uncontrolled
burning of the Amazon jungle by farmers and ranchers, a practice
which among other things has aggravated the worldwide ``greenhouse
effect.'' Here is a report on the slash-and-burn land clearing that
has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest in the past 10
years.

   Acrid smoke rises two miles high from
the slash-and-burn fires ravaging the Amazon rain forest as peasant
farmers and big cattle ranchers alike try to tame the jungle for
food and profit.
   With tens of thousands of square miles of lush green vegetation
put to the torch each year, many scientists and environmentalists
view it as an ecological disaster, not only destroying the forest
but poisoning the earth's atmosphere.
   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of land
clearing has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest cover,
an area larger than California.
   ``At this rate, the Amazon jungle could become an immense desert
within 100 years,'' says Alberto Setzer, an environmental engineer
with the Brazilian government's Space Research Institute.
   Further, a report by the institute said the amount of smoke from
the burnings is 1,000 times more than that emitted by the 1982
eruption of Mexico's El Chichon volcano, which caused ``serious
alterations in the chemical composition of the earth's atmosphere.''
   Critics charge that Brazil has allowed haphazard and destructive
settlement of the Amazon Basin, which covers an area roughly
two-thirds the size of the continental United States and
encompasses 30 percent of the world's tropical rain forests.
   Saying he was alerted by the disclosure that scientists had
found more than 6,000 man-made fires in the Amazon in a single day,
President Jose Sarney on Oct. 12 announced a new
environmental-protection program.
   The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to
government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle
ranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed
tropical timber.
   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said in
announcing the program. ``The era of unlimited natural resources is
over.''
   The ``Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation to
Brazil's Congress to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold
prospectors throughout the Amazon use the highly toxic element to
separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the
water.
   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economic
interests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil's
federal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carry
it out.''
   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor Amazon
Basin permitted land developers to burn off 50 percent of their
properties _ the fastest and cheapest way to open up clear areas _
and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.
   Brazil already had some environmental-protection laws in place,
but because of the country's vast size, deteriorating economic
situation and scarcity of real enforcement power, the laws were
largely ignored.
   Scientists at the Space Research Institute say that jungle fires
last year released nearly 500 million tons of carbonic gases into
the atmosphere, making Brazil one of the chief contributors to the
``greenhouse effect'' that is dangerously warming the earth's
climate.
   Scientific studies warn that rising global temperatures could
eventually cause the inundation of major U.S. and European coastal
cities and the parching of prime heartland farm areas in North
America, Europe and the Soviet Union.
   In Porto Velho, capital of the jungle state of Rondonia in far
western Brazil, Compton Tucker, a physical scientist with the U.S.
space agency, said the burnings in the Amazon were responsible for
10 percent of the carbon dioxide existing in the earth's atmosphere
today. Carbon dioxide is ``the major greenhouse gas,'' he said.
   The fires in Brazil also are responsible for large quantities of
carbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen oxides, scientists say.
   Tucker works for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., and his main task is to trace emissions in the
atmosphere from tropical forest burnings.
   The state with the largest percentage of its Amazon forest cover
destroyed by fire is Rondonia, roughly the size of Oregon, which
has become a mecca for hundreds of thousands of down-and-out
peasant farmers and free-lance gold prospectors, along with some
big-scale farmers and ranchers.
   Luiz Alberto Catanhede, Rondonia director of the Brazilian
Forest Service, says than 26,000 square miles of jungle, or close
to 28 percent of the state's territory, has been burned over the
past 13 years.
   During the May-to-October dry season, the burning Amazon casts a
cloud of smoke over Porto Velho, partially blocking out the sun.
Drivers have to switch on their headlights during the day, and the
airport is frequently shut down because of lack of visibility.

BRAZIL TRIES TO STOP SLASH-AND-BURN DESTRUCTION OF RICH AMAZON FORESTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Here in the state of Rondonia on the southern flank of the great Amazon rain 
forest, a new frontier opened up in the late 1970s. Encouraged for a decade by 
the Brazilian government, hundreds of thousands of settlers came to help push 
back the wilderness and share the bounty. Rondonia was the land of opportunity, 
the Golden West of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Now the heady frontier spirit has faded and a new realism seems to be setting 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Slash-and-burn farming and ranching has stripped away as much as one-third of 
the forest that once protected Rondonia's soil from the baking sun and leaching 
rains. The state's jungle Indian population has dwindled from 40,000 to 5,000, 
according to a study by Brazilian anthropologist Cecilia Meireles. 
</P>
<P>
Small farmers who thought Rondonia promised an escape from poverty have failed 
to improve their lot. Malaria is a frequent visitor at makeshift rural homes. 
Porto Velho, the state capital, is crowded with slum dwellers who gave up on 
the land. Although the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a 
frontier development program called Polonoroeste, farmers have received little 
technical or financial aid. More than half the land they have cleared is 
uncultivated and has given way to a matted growth of secondary brush called 
capoeira. 
</P>
<P>
Like other areas on the Amazon frontier, Rondonia obviously hasn't turned out 
the way it was supposed to. Officials here don't need foreign conservationists 
to tell them that, but in the past year, European and American worries about 
destruction of the Amazon forest have poured down on Brazil like tropical rain. 
Perhaps because of the international pressure, perhaps because it makes sense, 
Brazilian authorities are adopting new policies aimed at slowing the 
destruction. Some conservationists are skeptical about the effectiveness of the 
policies, but at least on paper, preservation is becoming the new official 
watchword in the Amazon region of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
President Jose Sarney has announced a series of protective measures in a 
program called "Our Nature." One new decree suspends official credits and tax 
breaks that had encouraged cattle ranchers to turn forest into pasture. The 
program also includes a zoning study that would put huge forest areas 
off-limits to ranchers, farmers, loggers and miners. 
</P>
<P>
The Rondonia state government already has its own zoning plan. Approved last 
June, it limits agricultural activities largely to central and southern areas 
of the state where most deforestation has taken place and where soils are 
richest. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Gov. Orestes Muniz, also Rondonia's planning secretary, says that by 
recovering millions of acres gone to capoeira, the state can save vast areas of 
virgin forest from the wasteful slash-and-burn cycle. Technicians are also 
experimenting with the use of capoeira as cover for crops that require shade, 
such as coffee and fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz said the zoning plan sets aside about 60% of the state's territory as 
natural preserves. To enforce protective measures, the state police force has 
created a forest patrol unit that now employs 350 officers and eventually will 
have 1,000. A freeze on all deforestation is in effect, pending implementation 
of the plan. Thirty percent of the state is designated as extractive reserves 
and managed forests, where rubber, Brazil nuts, medicinal plants and selected 
hardwoods and other products can be harvested without deforestation. Officials 
say the potential for economic returns is great. Rondonia woodlands contain an 
estimated 40,000 plant species, only about a tenth of which have been 
classified and studied. Another 30% of preserved forest area includes natural 
parks and Indian lands. 
</P>
<P>
To implement the plan, the state is starting a program called Planafloro, with 
projects for education, technical aid and financing to help people to preserve 
the forest while exploiting its riches. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that the small producer gets income from the standing forest, he 
will not cut more down," said Teodorico Rocha, a federal official helping on 
the Planafloro. 
</P>
<P>
Planafloro will cost an estimated $213 million, and the national government is 
negotiating for a loan from the World Bank to cover part of the cost. Rocha 
said it is "absurd" for Brazil to increase the heavy burden of its $115 billion 
foreign debt, but the country cannot afford to pay for the conservation program 
by itself. 
</P>
<P>
"There is consciousness for preserving the environment in Rondonia," he said. 
"What is lacking are the means, financing." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech this month, President Sarney appealed to foreigners who 
accuse Brazil of destroying the Amazon to help provide the means for preserving 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Transfer technology to us without costs," Sarney said. "Help us to combat the 
burning with airplanes, with equipment, with products. Help us to reforest with 
material, scientific and human resources." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid alone cannot prevent further destruction in the Amazon by economic 
interests and ignorance, but Brazilians who want to save the forest need all 
the help they can get.

   Fire destroyed nearly 50,000 square
miles of Amazon rain forest last year, wiping out a section of land
roughly the size of Louisiana, according to Brazilian satellite
studies released Wednesday.
   However, Brazil's Space Studies Institute said the amount of
forest cleared by farmers and ranchers was not as great as in 1987,
when 80,000 square miles were destroyed.
   Preliminary results of satellite studies showed that 48,400
square miles were set on fire in the Amazon last year, physicist
Marcos da Costa Pereira said by phone from the institute in Sao Jose
dos Campos, 60 miles northeast of Sao Paulo.
   The burned area comprises about 2.42 percent of the 2 million
square miles that is considered the legal Amazon, which is made up
of the Brazilian states of Amapa, Para, Roraima, Maranhao, Goias,
Acre, Rondonia, Mato Grosso and Amazonia.
   Pereira said about 30 percent to 40 percent of the 48,400 square
miles was either virgin rain forest or savannahs. The remaining area
was land that was burned for the second or third time by cattle
ranchers and farmers getting rid of secondary vegetation that had
grown back.
   In both cases, he added, the centuries-old slash-and-burn
technique was used to clear the land to plant crops and create
pastureland.
   He said it was difficult to say how much of the Amazon rain
forest has been devastated in all, ``but I think it's safe to say
that about 12 percent of the entire area has been destroyed over the
past century.''
   Pereira attributed the decline in burned forest to ``political
and economic factors,'' referring to the international pressure on
Brazil to preserve its rain forest.
   Another scientist at the National Institute of Research on the
Amazon in Manaus said the satellite findings can be misleading even
though he agrees a large portion of the rain forest has been
destroyed by fire.
   ``They overestimate the total amount of legal Amazon area
burned,'' said Philip Fearnside, who estimated 8.4 percent of the
legal Amazon rain forest has been destroyed this century.
   Fearnside said among other things, the satellite used to collect
the data is built to study clouds and oceans.
   He said satellite sensors often are ``saturated'' by heat from
fires, causing the satellite to register a large area being burned
even if the fire is confined to a small area.
   ``But the important thing is that a tremendous area of the rain
forest is being burned,'' Fearnside stressed.
   The Amazon accounts for 30 percent of the world's tropical rain
forests.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: the family.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The migratory birds and the wetland fit the conservancy's
charter. With $300,000 from its revolving fund, the
conservationists bought the ranch and leased it back to the
McQuerry family with certain conditions.
   The family would have to change certain farming operations. For
instance, they would not be permitted to graze the wetland area
from fall to the following summer when the birds use the estuary.
   When the family was able, they would buy the ranch back, but
those covenants would remain.
   ``If we hadn't stepped in, certainly the family was going into
bankruptcy,'' says Ralph Grossi, president of the American Farmland
Trust. ``They would have lost the farm.''
   The farmland trust felt there was a real danger of development
to the land and the natural ecosystem around the lake.
   The United States covers some 3,600,000 square miles or 2.3
trillion acres. Of those, 78,000 square miles or almost 50 million
acres are inland waterways. There are also more than 88,000 miles
of tidal shoreline.
   Conservationist groups can't protect it all, nor, they say,
should they. Often they seek to cooperate with developers, allowing
residential uses, but sequestering other areas. In some cases,
developers pay mitigation fees for the damage their developments
might cause. Those funds are used to enhance the protected land.
   Says the Nature Conservancy's Dennis: ``When you're talking
about an ecosystem, you could be talking about anything from 5,000
acres to 500 square miles.''
   So he outlines a compromise, a core that the conservationists
want to own and manage. Around that they would establish a larger
area where timbering and mining are banned. ``Then you may want an
additional buffer where development is OK, but it's got to be
limited. You may allow a cluster of homes here on 2-to 5-acre
tracts and preserve farmland over there.''
   Even individuals are taking a page from their book and designing
small local operations to save such properties as a farm in
Virginia or 400 acres of rolling countryside in Connecticut. The
farm remained a farm, and the Connecticut tract is now home to an
organically safe golf course.
   In the array of people in the conservation army, there is also
an array of purposes.
   The Nature Conservancy's 542,000 members, dedicated to
preserving habitats, have financed a $600 million organization that
has saved almost 4 million sensitive acres since it was founded in
1953. It has 1,000 employees and probably 10,000 volunteers and
covers every state
   Considerably younger (10 years old) and smaller (a staff of 30
nationwide) is the American Farmland Trust, dedicated to saving the
nation's farms and improving farming techniques. Yet, it churns
accounts of more than $2 million to get more acres for the buck.
   ``We are concerned about the debt burden in agriculture,'' says
the trust's president, Ralph Grossi. ``Many farmers are going out
of business and their land isn't being cared for adequately.''
   Organizations from the National Wildlife Federation to the
Audubon Society, from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Ducks
Unlimited, a hunter's group, often find themselves working in
concert.
   They all have one thing in common. They can move more quickly
than local or state governments can, and, using charitable tax
benefits, they can bring in a deal cheaper than developers can.
   By stripping a piece of land of development rights, it is not
only protected regardless of who owns it, but income tax benefits
can either bring the owner a sizable tax deduction or provide
instant cash for a farmer.
   It also reduces the value of the land and hence its tax
assessment, which deprives the county or state of some tax revenue.
But counties and states usually are willing to forgo taxes on some
property to enhance the value of land around it.
   Witness New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has asked for $1.9
billion to set aside areas of the Empire State for scenic and
recreation purposes. California has provided more than $700 million
for similar purposes, and Florida has an active land acquisition
program.
   But the smallest of communities can be stirred to action.
Michigan's west coast is a beautiful blend of dunes, orchards and
sandy beaches on Lake Michigan. It is a magnet for those wanting
second homes, and unlike the coast of California, which it mimics
in miniature, it has no coastal commission to protect it.
   Local land trusts, with the help of the Farmland Trust, moved in
to buy a 507-acre farm on the Old Mission Peninsula, blocking any
further residential development. It will remain an orchard in an
area that prides itself as being the ``Cherry Capital of the
World.''
   ``It's unlikely that some crops will be grown in any quantity in
the United States 30 to 40 years from now,'' says Grossi of the
Farmland Trust. ``The growing areas that are required, the climate,
the soil, the weather, those unique values are essentially the same
as those that attract people.''

   The death threat was nothing new to the
rubber tappers' union in this Amazon town.
   ``I've been hired to kill you,'' read a scrawled note slipped
under the office door in November. It said three union leaders and
the local's truck driver ``can't make it to 1991.''
   The note was unsigned, but there was little doubt at union
headquarters who was behind it: cattle ranchers, the tappers'
enemies in a bloody dispute for land rights in Brazil's tropical
rain forest.
   Since the union was founded in 1975, such threats have been
common and deadly serious. The local says ``pistoleiros,'' gunmen
hired by landowners, have killed more than 150 tappers and Indians.
   One victim was CHico Mendes, a rubber tapper and union leader
who had become an internationally consulted expert on the Amazon.
Shotgun fire from ambush cut him down in December 1988 at his home
in Xapuri, near the Bolivian border 2,650 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   A local rancher, Darli Alves da Silva, and his son Darci were
arrested. Their trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Xapuri.
   ``This is the land where they threaten and do it,'' said
Osmarino AMancio Rodrigues, president of the Brasileia union local
And one of those on the note's list. ``No one has ever escaped.''
   He added, with a laugh: ``Two of my bodyguards were threatened.
Now I'll have to get bodyguards for my bodyguards.''
   Rodrigues, 34, is widely regarded as the successor to Chico
Mendes as the leader of a grass-roots movement against destruction
of the rain forest.
   Jose da SIlva Pereira, another tapper on the death list, said:
``When ranchers want to get rid of a tapper, they come in shooting,
kill his livestock and burn his house. If he doesn't leave, he
dies.''
   A new alliance of rubber tappers and Amazon Indians is
challenging the notion that ``developing'' the forest means cutting
it down for timber or burning it to make pasture.
   Uncontrolled slash-and-burn clearing already has destroyed more
than 250,000 square miles of rain forest, an area the equal to
Texas. A patch of jungle the size of a football field disappears
every eight seconds, adding to the greenhouse effect that is
warming the planet.
   Those whose livelihoods come from the forest favor an
alternative called ``extractivist reserves,'' a new system of
landholding in which the government expropriates rain forest to
allow commercial harvesting of fruits, nuts and other renewable
products.
   Such reserves give tappers legal rights to the jungle, where for
years they were squatters on the huge feudal estates of cattle
barons and big landowners. The government now has 7{ million acres
of reserves in AMazonia and plans to set aside 55 million more by
1993.
   ONe region of nearly 2{ million acres is named for Chico Mendes.
   ``There won't be peace in the forest without land reform,'' said
Rodrigues, a short, swarthy man with a black beard. ``In Amazonia,
that means Indian reservations and extractivist reserves.''
   The main argument for protecting the forest is simply that it's
More profitable alive.
   Aminded consumers in the United States and Europe. Amazon fruits,
nuts, oils and essences are heading north to make everything from
ice cream and nut candy to cosmetics.
   ``We have to prove the economic value of the rain forest and
generate income to save it,'' anthropologist Jason Clay said in an
interview. Clay is research director of Cultural Survival, a
non-profit group based in Cambridge, Mass., and visits Brazil
frequently.
   Cultural SUrvival buys jungle products and resells them to
companies abroad, charging a 5 percent ``environmental premium''
used to help forest peoples.
   Clay said he showed samples of 350 rain forest products and
businessmen were interested in 38 of them. He reported orders worth
$4 million, and said several companies pledged part of their
profits to rain forest projects.
   Extractivist reserves are ``one of the few environmentally
viable alternatives for the Amazon,'' he said.
   ``We have to make the reserves more economically rewarding. Then
we can use them to recover degraded areas and as buffer zones for
the genetic hotspots, the really fragile parts of Amazonia that
shouldn't be used.''
   Brazil has tried for decades to tap the riches of the Amazon, a
wilderness of two million square miles that is larger than Europe
without the Soviet Union.
   Amazonia contains 30 percent of the world's rain forest;
one-fifth of its fresh water; 5 million species of plants, animals
and insects, and rich deposits of gold, diamonds, iron, tin and
other minerals. Despite those riches, most of its inhabitants live
in grinding poverty.
   Attempts by the military regime of 1964-1985 to ``open up the
Amazon'' were an ecological nightmare.
   Huge development projects like the Trans-Amazon highway, farm
settlements and the Balbina and Tucurui hydroelectric dams wiped
out huge tracts of forest and nearly destroyed some native tribes.
   Government incentives attracted cattle ranchers, who kept
burning the jungle off the sandy soil to replace pasture that
lasted only two or three years. Experts say their productivity is Secretary
Jose Lutzenberger, an internationally
respected ecologist, says Brazil is trying to change its image as a
destroyer of the environment.
   ``Extractivist reserves are extremely important,'' he said in an
interview. ``We must create many more of them.''
   Canada has pledged $10 million to the National Rubber Tappers
Council, starting next year, to develop extractivist reserves.
   THe newest and largest of the special areas is the Chico Mendes
REserve, which covers 2.4 million acres in the western Amazon state
of Acre, where the most violence has occurred.
   On the reserves, tappers' associations sign long-term contracts
with the government for the ``use and benefit'' of the land. They
must obey rules for protecting the environment or forfeit the area.
   ``This was our great victory,'' said Nelson Custodio da Silva, a
rubber tapper. ``We fought four years for this reserve.''
   Problems remain. Most reserves have not yet been expropriated
and the government foresees a long legal battle with landowners.
The Chico Mendes Reserve was created by former President Jose
Sarney three days before he left office in March.
   ``It was a great party, but the bill wasn't paid,'' Marco
Antonio Mendes, the Acre state environment secretary, said in an
interview.
   Tappers also have not escaped exploitation by ``marreteiros'' -
middlemen who trade commercial goods like salt and cloth for rubber
and nuts, and routinely charge three or four times the regular
price.
   Nearly all the profit from jungle produce is made elsewhere.
Tappers earn only 3 to 4 cents a pound for Brazil nuts, about 2
percent of the New York wholesale price.
   Acre state's Technology Foundation is running a unique
experiment in forest management on the remote border with Amazonas
state.
   At the 166,000-acre Antimari reserve, technicians are studying
how to ``densify'' the forest by planting without upsetting the
natural balance. They are concentrating on bamboo, timber and more
than 800 types of medicinal plants, as well as rubber and Brazil
nuts.
   ``This is a first for Amazonia,'' said Gilberto Siqueira, the
foundation president. ``It will show us the limits of exploitation
without disturbing the whole.''
   Another experimental project is a cooperative in Xapuri that
shells, packs and exports Brazil nuts. It is the first
nut-processing plant owned by the tappers.
paid a fair price,'' said Rolando Polanco, a worker at the
cooperative. ``We're trying to give the tappers a better deal.''
   The plant, built with a $25,000 gift from Cultural Survival,
employs 78 people and processes 1,100 pounds of nuts a day, barely
one-tenth of the production in Xapuri alone. Polanco said expansion
depends on donations from environmental groups and businessmen.

<HEAD>Brazil's Environment Chief Vows to Develop the Amazon `Humanely'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Brazil's environment czar vowed Tuesday
to curb the destruction of the Amazon rain forest and to develop
the biologically sensitive area in a ``rational, humane and
ecological'' manner.
   ``We can't stop development and growth, but yes, we can make
human occupation compatible with the survival of the planet,'' said
National Environment Secretary Jose Lutzenberger.
   Lutzenberger, 64, outlined a plan for encouraging development
and farming while preserving the unique ecological balance of the
2-million square mile rain forest.
   A world-renown ecologist, he said the government will introduce
a program to revitalize the forest's soil through organic
agricultural methods and to reduce the traditional style of
slash-and-burn farming that has destroyed 200,000 square miles of
the region.
   He said the Collor de Mello administration, which first took
office in March, will also quadruple its fire-fighting efforts.
   ``In this way we will stop small farmers, impoverished by soil
that only gives two or three harvests, from burning other tracts of
the jungle,'' said Lutzenberger. He said the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank had expressed interest in financing
the program but gave no details.
   Slash-and-burn farmers clear large tracts of unused land by
setting fires and then plant crops until the soil is exhausted.
They then move on to fresh land.
   Lutzenberger said the burnings are now monitored by satellites
that can detect even small brush fires. He said forest rangers in
helicopters are used to catch and fine violators.
   He said Brazil will also explore alternative energy sources such
as solar, wind and biomass energy instead of building the huge
hydroelectric dams that were popular in recent decades.
   Environmentalists have opposed the dams saying they flood huge
tracts of Amazon land, killing trees and animals while providing
few benefits for the thousands of Indians and Brazilian farmers
living in the area.
   He specifically singled out the Itaipu dam, built by Brazil and
Paraguay on the Parana River dividing the countries and the Tucurui
project in the Amazon jungle.
   ``Itaipu only produces at 60 percent of its capacity and we
don't even know what to do with so much energy,'' Lutzenberger
said. ``Tucurui generates electricity for large aluminum factories
that export minerals at low cost and the Amazon natives don't see
any benefit.''
   Lutzenberger said Brazil should scrap plans for large dams in
the rain forest and concentrate instead on promoting small
generators and floating river turbines financed and run by local
municipalities and private businessmen.
   The appointment of Lutzenberger, an agronomist educated in the
United States, was seen as a victory for conservationists, who
claim Brazil has traditionally done little to preserve the Amazon.
   ``There are many people who would like to see the jungle
disappear to raise cattle, but they won't do it with my approval,''
he said.

RAIN FORESTS DISAPPEARING 50% QUICKER THAN FEARED

Destruction of the world's tropical forests is occurring nearly 50% faster than 
the best previous scientific estimates showed, with enough trees being lost 
each year to cover the state of Washington, the World Resources Institute said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Between 40 million and 50 million acres are lost annually, according to new 
satellite measurements of vanishing timberland, with the biggest losses 
occurring in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier estimates by the United Nations and other organizations placed annual 
losses at 28 million acres. But these estimates were based on data gathered 
before 1980, compared to the latest findings, which are based on 1987 data. The 
earlier figures also were obtained largely through less accurate ground 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's published report marked the first comprehensive picture of worldwide 
deforestation trends based on a compilation of recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were startled, frankly," institute President James Gustave Speth said in a 
telephone interview from Washington. "We're looking at an environmental tragedy 
unfolding. It's much worse than had been previously suspected." 
</P>
<P>
The report, published in collaboration with the United Nations, has disturbing 
implications both for global warming and the extinction of plant and animal 
species, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical forests are believed to not only shelter half of the world's plant and 
animal species -- most of them as yet undiscovered -- but serve as a major 
brake on the buildup of carbon dioxide, a principal contributor to global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
Forests, most prominently in the Third World, are cut down at a rapid pace to 
provide wood for export and fuel, and to clear land for development and 
agriculture. When forests are cleared and burned, huge amounts of the carbon is 
returned to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas. Tree burning 
accounts for an estimated 30% of worldwide total carbon dioxide emissions. 
Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline accounts for most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"If you combine increasing deforestation with the increasing use of fossil 
fuels in the industrial countries . . . it's easy to understand why the 
emissions of greenhouse gases have tripled over a 30-year period," Speth said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also cited reason for optimism, noting that in the last several years 
some nations, notably Brazil and India, have promised to curb the clearing of 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington said it was 
too early to comment on the new estimates but that the institute's 
deforestation figures were based on "fairly reputable" studies. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Tillier, public affairs officer with the World Bank in Washington, 
agreed. She said the higher deforestation rate was "along the lines" of recent 
estimates by the bank, which finances international development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Allen L. Hammond, editor of the volume, "World Resources, 1990-91," called the 
updated estimate released Thursday conservative. "In countries where we have 
reliable new data, its far worse than 50%. Fifty percent is a world average," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said most of the estimates were based on data collected by U.S. 
satellites and analyzed by scientists in the countries studied and by outside 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The data covers only half of the world's nations that have tropical forests. 
Additional studies are under way, including an update due in 1992 by the U.N. 
Food and Agriculture Organization, whose study released in 1980 was the basis 
for the lower estimates called into question Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said that when that information is made public, it will, "in fact, show 
even higher rates of deforestation than we're reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which has the world's largest remaining tropical forests, also has the 
largest area of annual deforestation. The new studies indicate that Brazil's 
annual losses are between 10 and 20 million acres within the Amazon and 2.5 
million acres outside the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a peak year of deforestation in Brazil, the rate of loss was as much 
as 80% higher than earlier estimates for that country. During that year, Brazil 
caused 1.2 million tons of carbon to be released into the atmosphere, virtually 
the same amount pumped into the air by the much more industrialized United 
States from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the 
destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax 
incentives that led to large-scale land clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, President Fernando Collor de Mello announced that Brazil's armed 
forces were ready to help stop the burning and deforestation of the Amazon rain 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
But progress in Brazil is not expected to change the overall picture because 
deforestation in most other Third World countries appears to be increasing, the 
institute said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Resources Institute's report Thursday noted dramatic upswings in 
other countries' deforestation rates. 
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar, for example, 1.7 million acres are lost each year, "an astounding" 
545% increase over 1980 estimates. The 1980 estimate relied on information 
collected in the mid-1970's and a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization 
computer model of rural population trends. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimate is based on recent field work, a continuing analysis of aerial 
photographs and satellite data and extrapolations from the U.N. data. 
</P>
<P>
In India, satellite sensing studies point to a 10-fold increase over previous 
estimates to 3.7 million acres a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian deforestation estimate of 2.2 million aces a year is 50% more 
than the 1980 estimate, and Costa Rica's figure rose 90% to 300,000 acres lost 
annually. Only in Thailand are the old and new estimates comparable. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s were a decade of devastation for the global environment. In the 
1990s things could either get much, much worse or we could begin to start a 
healing. It all depends on what our governments are willing to do, more than 
anything else," Speth said. He called developments in Brazil encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The report, published in collaboration with the U.N. Environment Program and 
the U.N. Development Program, also for the first time ranked greenhouse gas 
emissions from 146 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Soviet Union ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. 
Combined, they accounted for nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions 
worldwide in 1987, followed by Brazil, China, India, Japan, West Germany and 
Great Britain. If the European Community is considered as a single entity, it 
would rank second behind the United States instead of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the equivalent of 6.5 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon 
dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons were added to the atmosphere in 1987, 
the report said.

<HEAD>Government Begins Emergency Plan to Control Fires in Amazon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Jorge Mederos</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government official said Tuesday police
are fighting indiscriminate burning and tree-cutting in parts of the
Amazon rain forest under emergency measures that already have
brought $9 million in fines.
   Jose Roberto Lima, a spokesman for the state's Brazilian
Environmental Institute, said institute agents and federal police
began patrolling part of the Amazon jungle in five helicopters in
early August.
   In that month, ranchers and farmers traditionally begin to burn
off forest growth for pasture and planting.
   ``The area is wild and the settlers extremely dangerous. If you
don't police the jungle with a machine gun on your side, you're as
good as dead,'' Lima said in an interview.
   He said agents had handed out fines of about $9 million in the
first 15 days of the exercise.
   Among those fined were farmers, ranchers, steel mills that use
wood to fuel blast furnaces and 15 sawmills.
   Lima said fines will be used to support an emergency
environmental package called ``Our Nature'' announced earlier this
year.
   Amid mounting world concern that the destruction of the forest
could disastrously change global weather, the Brazilian government
also this year suspended incentives for large-scale agricultural and
cattle ranching projects and created a special police force to
control fires.
   Satellite photographs show that in the past 10 years the 2
million-square-mile rain forest, the world's largest, has lost an
area half the size of West Virginia to slashing, burning and mining.
   Ecologists charge the government has done little to discourage
the uncontrolled destruction.
   Brazil initially refused offers of help from international
organizations and foreign governments, saying that would amount to
meddling in its internal affairs but has softened that position in
recent months.
   The government earlier this year turned down offers from the
United States, France and the Netherlands to discuss swapping part
of Brazil's $115 million debt for preserving Amazon land, which
covers two-thirds of Brazil and is home to 15 million people.
   But Lima said the institute hopes to receive help from foreign
governments to strengthen its efforts.
   Italy and Canada already have promised five tanker planes to help
put out forest fires, he said.
   In just 25 hours of flights over the so-called Parrot's Beak
region in southern Para _ the site of bloody clashes between peasant
farmers and large landowners _ agents found 150 areas where the
forest was being illegally destroyed, Lima said.
   He said the patrols have rescued 150 animals and 120 birds, some
threatened with extinction.
   The patrols will continue for three months over the jungle states
of Para, Mato Grosso, Rondonia and Acre, Lima said. The so-called
Legal Amazon also includes the states of Amapa, Roraima, Maranhao,
Tocantins and Amazonas.
   Uncontrolled colonization has destroyed more than 5 percent of
the rain forest, satellite photos show. Some researchers put the
figure at nearer 10 percent.

   A campaign to preserve the remaining half of the
world's tropical rain forests has finally taken root, but the task
is enormous and the last gasp for the ``lungs of the Earth'' could
be less than a century away.
   Environmentalists are pleased with their initial success three
years after they began challenging governments, industries and
banks. But an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed each
minute, and the young preservation movement seeks fundamental
changes in political, economic and social structures to save the
teeming jungles of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
   An aggressive campaign of publicity, education and confrontation
began in 1985 and appeared to capture the world's attention last
year. Almost overnight, it seemed, world leaders began calling for
greater efforts to halt the chopping and burning of rain forests.
Conferences discussed such technical conservation issues as
``sustainable management.'' Rock stars Sting and The Grateful Dead
played benefit concerts for the cause. Media coverage increased.
   Some recent fruits of that effort:
   _Brazil in October announced suspension of tax benefits for
landowners who destroy the Amazon rain forest, the largest and
fastest-disappearing on Earth.
   _The International Tropical Timber Organization approved a $4
million project in northern Brazil that calls for loggers to consult
with environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians and
local workers to plan long-term forest development and preservation.
   _Some 500 Brazilian Indians from 20 tribes gathered last month to
oppose planned hydroelectric dams in the Amazon that could flood
rain forest areas, including their homes. The meeting was the first
by the tribes, which traditionally have battled over territory and
remained isolated.
   _Thailand imposed a nationwide logging ban after
environmentalists blamed uncontrolled timber harvesting for floods
that killed more than 350 people in November. Last April, officials
suspended plans for a hydroelectric dam that environmentalists said
would have ruined Thailand's last virgin rain forest.
   _West Germany earmarked about $80 million for saving tropical
forests.
   ``Without a coherent strategy for protecting the tropical forests
in which everyone concerned participates, we cannot master the vast
problems threatening the future of all mankind,'' said West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``We have to be ambitious. We're in trouble,'' said Randall
Hayes, head of the U.S.-based Rainforest Action Network. ``If we
don't get the changes we need in the next five years, then we've
lost the rain forests.''
   The results could be catastrophic.
   Rain forests cover some 2.4 billion acres of the planet, about
half the original amount, ecologists say.
   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' they act as a
pollution filter, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. If
carbon dioxide isn't removed from the atmosphere, it can trap heat,
which some scientists say causes a global warming trend called the
greenhouse effect. Burning the rain forests, a common way to create
arable land, also adds carbon to the atmosphere.
   Rain forests are storehouses of plant, insect and animal species,
some of which could prove useful for drugs and other scientific
endeavors. Scientists say only a small percentage of the 5 million
species in the forests, many of them unique to the tropical
environment, have been studied.
   In addition, 200 million people live in and around rain forests,
including indigenous tribes who depend on them for sustenance and
shelter.
   Nonetheless, preservation presents complexities that cut across
social and political boundaries. Many rain forests are in developing
countries that need to capitalize on their natural resources and
must borrow money for costly modernization projects, such as
highways and power plants.
   Brazil, for example, has the developing world's largest foreign
debt at $115 billion. Two of its limited number of export products
are beef and timber _industries that cause major forest destruction.
Cattle ranchers burn forests to create grazing land; loggers clear
jungle in search of exotic hardwoods.
   Meanwhile, poor farmers burn small tracts to grow crops. The
soil, so fertile under the rain forest canopy, is then leached of
nutrients in seasonal heavy rains, forcing farmers to move on and
burn another patch every few years.
   Last fall, Brazilian President Jose Sarney suspended tax benefits
for land developers and banned exports of unprocessed tropical
timber. ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of man on Earth. The era of unlimited
natural resources is over,'' he said.
   But environmentalists contend the harmful practices continue.
Now, Brazil is balking at proposals to swap some of its foreign debt
for saving parcels of rain forest. Such plans would entail creation
of an international commission to watch over the preserved jungle.
   ``We can't turn the Amazon into a sort of national park for
humanity,'' Brazil's foreign minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, said.
``Our priority is economic development. We're open to international
suggestions, but not those that interfere in Brazilian sovereignty.''
   Industrial giants such as the United States and European
countries, which have little or no rain forest, have been the most
vocal about the developing nations' efforts to halt the destruction.
That causes particular resentment.
   A conference of eight nations in the Amazon region, including
Brazil, earlier this month issued a declaration rejecting foreign
interference while saying development must preserve the environment
and wild resources.
   ``Part of the problem is that it's coming down to the developed
countries versus the developing countries,'' said a U.S. activist
who monitors the World Bank, the largest source of aid to developing
nations.
   ``They (developing countries) say, `You raped your countries to
get developed, and now you're stopping us from doing it,''' said the
activist, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
   But N.F. Potter, Canada's executive director at the 151-nation
World Bank, said: ``There are ways of doing things without making
the same mistakes.''
   The World Bank has been criticized by environmentalists, who say
it ignores ecological issues when funding projects. At issue are
billions of dollars; in the fiscal year ending June 30, the bank
expects to loan a record $21 billion.
   ``These bankers are unbelievably ignorant. They are absolutely
reckless,'' said Brent Blackwelder of the U.S.-based Environmental
Policy Institute.
   Under increasing pressure from member nations and environmental
groups not to fund ecologically harmful projects, the bank set up a
department in 1987 to assess the potential damage of development
projects.
   ``You can see a lot more environmental consciousness than there
was two years ago,'' said an official with a U.S. agency that
monitors aid. ``There has been movement. I'm not saying there has
been all the movement necessary.''

   Conservation groups applauded a
decision Friday by the international timber industry to promote
environment-conscious logging in the Amazon jungle, the world's
largest tropical rainforest.
   The U.S.-based World Wildlife Fund said the decision _ the first
of its kind by the timber industry _ could slow destruction of the
Amazon rainforest, a key regulator of the world's weather.
   The International Tropical Timber Organization, an association
of 42 producing and consuming countries, approved a $4 million
logging and conservation project in the remote jungle state of
Acre, on Brazil's border with Bolivia, 2,800 miles northwest of Rio
de Janeiro.
   The project calls for ``integrated'' development of jungle
products, such as Brazil nuts and rubber, as well as timber. It
also calls for loggers to consult with environmental groups,
government agencies, native Indians and local workers to plan
long-term development to preserve the rainforest.
   ``This was the big one. We hope the Acre project can serve as a
model not just for the rest of the Amazon but for all tropical
forests,'' Adam Markham, press spokesman for the World Wildlife
Fund, told the AP at the end of a 10-day meeting of the Timber
Organization.
   The organization's members control 95 percent of the world's
$5.6 billion tropical timber trade.
   As timber trade shifts away from the shrinking forests of Africa
and southeast Asia, the mahogany-rich Amazon is seen as the next
great source of hardwood.
   But conservationists are worried about the effect on the climate
of uncontrolled logging in the Amazon basin, a 2 million
square-mile region as large as Europe that covers parts of seven
South American countries and contains a third of the world's
rainforest.
   Already the Amazon forest is disappearing at the rate of some 27
million acres a year, mostly at the hands of small farmers and
ranchers who cut and burn the trees, Markham said.
   ``The rainforest is a gaseous sink for carbon dioxide. The trees
soak it up. If we cut them down, there's no way to get rid of the
gas. And that contributes to the greenhouse effect,'' he said.
   The greenhouse effect is a gradual warming of the Earth's
surface because of excessive carbon dioxide and pollutants in the
atmosphere that trap the sun's heat, like a greenhouse. It is
thought to be a possible cause of the current drought in the U.S.
Midwest.
   The Acre project, which will get about $3 million from the
Brazilan government and the rest from the Timber Organization, is
the largest approved since the organization was founded in 1986.
   Smaller conservation programs, similar to the Acre project, were
approved for Bolivia and Ecuador.
   Other proposals approved at the Rio meeting were:
   _Development of a ``news market service,'' to help producing
countries market better.
   _Standardization of timber specifications among member
countries, to cut waste caused by conflicting measurements.
   _Improvement of harvesting and processing equipment.
   The next meeting of the organization is scheduled for November
in Yokohama, Japan.

   The sweeping victories by
conservatives in last week's congressional and gubernatorial races
will mean bad news for the rain forest and its defenders,
environmentalists say.
   Conservatives won a large majority in last week's voting, and
showed special strength in the nine states of the Amazon region.
   ``Almost all . . . are totally opposed to ecological concerns
and rational development,'' Fernando Gabeira, a leader of Brazil's
small Green Party, said over the weekend.
   The federal government sets most environmental policy, but
political scientist David Fleischer of the University of Brasilia
noted: ``Almost all policy enforcement is carried out by local
authorities. If they show no interest in protecting the
environment, decisions at the federal level lose much of their
impact.''
   Right-wing candidates for governor won outright victories in
three of the nine states and were headed for Nov. 25 runoffs in the
other six.
   Only in two small states, Acre and Amapa, did pro-ecology
candidates even get to the runoffs.
   Candidates had to win an absolute majority to take a first-round
victory.
   In congressional races, conservatives won at least 11 of the 13
senate chairs at stake in the Amazon region and all but a few of
the house seats.
   Rightist populists have long dominated the impoverished region.
Much of their success comes from support by major landowners, who
traditionally control the votes of the rural poor.
   Many voters also view environmentalism as an attempt to block
economic growth and lock the Amazon into perennial backwardness.
   Slash-and-burn techniques used by ranchers and farmers have
already destroyed about 8 percent of the 2-million-square-mile
wilderness, according to government figures.
   In Amazonas, the area's largest state, incoming governor
Gilberto Mestrinho favors widescale destruction of the rain forest
to promote large mining and agricultural projects.
   The state's new senator, Amazonino Mendes, proposed handing out
chain saws to settlers to speed the felling of the forest.
   In neighboring Roraima state, both gubernatorial finalists
openly opposed federal plans to remove thousands of gold miners
from the territory of the Yanomami Indians, the world's largest
remaining primitive tribe.
   The miners illegally search for gold, diamonds and other
minerals on Indian land. Armed clashes and imported diseases killed
about 1,500 of the tribe's remaining 9,000 members in the past
three years.
   The favorite in Roraima's gubernatorial race is Romero Juca, now
on trial for illegally authorizing logging on Indian land when he
was chief of the National Indian Foundation in the early 1980s.
   ``The elections in Roraima could spell the end for the
Yanomami,'' Fleischer remarked,
   In Para state, the runoff pits anti-ecology candidates Jaber
Barbalho and Sahid Xerfan.
   Para has been the site of repeated clashes between Indians and
miners. Miners have dumped about 600 tons of mercury from gold
prospecting into the Tapajos River.
   ``We have no preference in Para,'' Gabeira said. ``Neither
possible winner will defend the Indians or the Amazon.''
   Big farmers are blamed for most of the violence plaguing the
region. More than 1,000 peasant activists were killed in land
conflicts in the past decade.
   The Rev. Ricardo Resende of the Pastoral Land Commission said in
a phone interview from Para state, ``The new governors are well
known and most have never demonstrated any interest in protecting
the region's poor. Small farmers will continue to be expelled from
their land.''
   His commission is linked with the Roman Catholic Church.
   Gabeira said the only bright spot was in Acre, home to thousands
of rubber tappers, where Jorge Viana of the pro-environmentalist
Workers Party won a spot in the second round.
   His strength is largely attributed to the legacy of
world-renowned unionist and ecologist Chico Mendes, a Workers Party
activist murdered in 1988. Mendes' alleged killers are going on
trial Oct. 25, and the publicity could boost Viana's campaign.
   There was another note of encouragement to the rain forest's
advocates Sunday contained in an article in the newspaper Jornal do
Brasil.
   It reported that the area of the Amazon rain forest destroyed by
fires in 1990 was down considerably from last year. Data compiled
by Brazil's National Institute of Space Research showed overall
destruction may be down by as much as 50 percent, the newspaper
said.
   Institute President Marcio Barbosa was quoted as saying that the
space satellite that monitors the Amazon has been crucial to
efforts to prevent further damage.

<P>
When the Nature Conservancy bought 502 square miles of New Mexico -- 90% of a 
mountain range and a more diverse population of mammals than any national park 
in the United States -- it was hailed as a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly was. But the purchase in late January was also the culmination of 
an explosion of conservation efforts in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
A new breed of conservationists is buying up big chunks of the American 
landscape, stamping the land inviolate to the bulldozer's blade. 
</P>
<P>
How much money the conservancy paid for the Gray Ranch in New Mexico, astride 
the Continental Divide, wasn't made public. But it was probably in the 
neighborhood of $18 million, a sum that would have sounded improbable to a 
conservationist's ears a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
What it brought under the conservancy's protection was almost all the Animas 
Mountain range; some 100 plant and animal species listed as endangered, 
threatened or rare; 13 pre-Columbian archeological digs and hundreds of others 
as yet unexplored; herds of Chihuahuan pronghorn antelope; seven different 
habitat types from desert grassland to chaparral and coniferous forest; and 
endangered bits of nature from the white-eared hummingbird to the night 
blooming cereus. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy acted when it discovered the ranch owners wanted to sell and 
there was the threat the land might be broken up and developed. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy President John C. Sawhill, announcing the buy, said: "Few intact 
natural systems of this caliber exist in the world today. The . . . effort also 
represents the future trend for the Nature Conservancy and its partners. To 
truly ensure our natural world for future generations, we are developing 
creative ways to safeguard much larger landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, such an effort would have been only a dream, but 
conservationists are becoming sophisticated advocates -- scientists, business 
graduates, experts in law and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Inch by precious inch they are preserving farmland, wilderness and open spaces 
against development, more effectively than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy is a sort of symbol for individuals and other land 
trusts. Before the New Mexico deal, it was taking an average of 1,000 acres a 
day out of commercial play. 
</P>
<P>
Says Mike Dennis, general counsel of the conservancy: "For every scientist we 
have around here, we probably have an MBA, a tax lawyer and a real estate 
attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have sharpened their skills in the private sector, recycling 
many of the same dollars each time to buy new land. They have discovered 
revolving funds, a war fund that doesn't have to stay invested. They can plunk 
down several million dollars until, by prior arrangement, a government agency 
can repay them, assuming custodial care of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Or they can buy a piece of property, deprive it of the potential for commercial 
development, and resell the land for a somewhat lesser cost to what they think 
is an appropriate buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Who is that buyer? A farmer who will farm without being tempted by high 
developer prices, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which wants to protect 
the land, or a trust that is able to preserve the land as open space, a vista, 
a place apart. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the conservationists send the resale dollars back into their 
revolving funds to be used again. 
</P>
<P>
None of these organizations or individuals could succeed without local support. 
When a developer wanted to take a 147-acre scenic hay meadow in Jackson Hole, 
Wyo., to put in 70 to 80 houses, the local land trust negotiated an option on 
the land priced at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The county came up with one-third and the land trust raised the rest from 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jean Hocker, director of the Land Trust Alliance, an umbrella organization 
in Washington for hundreds of local land trusts: "The community heard about it 
and came to the rescue." The deal took three months. Speed is important. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 800 local land trusts established in states, counties and 
communities -- almost half of them formed in the past 10 years. They protect 
about 2 million acres and they own 300,000. Some of them have million-dollar 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes conservationists act in concert. 
</P>
<P>
The McQuerry Ranch, 3,500 acres at the foot of the 11,000-foot peaks of 
Nevada's Ruby Mountains, was in financial trouble, the family in danger of 
losing the land they had farmed for generations. 
</P>
<P>
A third of the ranch is a unique desert wetland area around Franklin Lake, the 
kind of terrain that attracts resort development. It is also a nesting area for 
migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
The American Farmland Trust suggested to the Nature Conservancy that the best 
way to preserve the land was to enhance the way in which the farm was operated 
by the family. 
</P>
<P>
The migratory birds and the wetland fit the conservancy's charter. With 
$300,000 from its revolving fund, the conservationists bought the ranch and 
leased it back to the McQuerry family with certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The family would have to change certain farming operations. For instance, they 
would not be permitted to graze the wetland area from fall to the following 
summer when the birds use the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
When the family was able, they would buy the ranch back, but those covenants 
would remain. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't stepped in, certainly the family was going into bankruptcy," says 
Ralph Grossi, president of the American Farmland Trust. "They would have lost 
the farm." 
</P>
<P>
The farmland trust felt there was a real danger of development to the land and 
to the natural ecosystem around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The United States covers some 3.6 million square miles, or 2.3 trillion acres. 
Of those, 78,000 square miles, or almost 50 million acres, are inland 
waterways. There are also more than 88,000 miles of tidal shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationist groups can't protect it all, nor, they say, should they. Often 
they seek to cooperate with developers, allowing residential uses, but 
sequestering other areas. In some cases, developers pay mitigation fees for the 
damage their developments might cause. Those funds are used to enhance the 
protected land. 
</P>
<P>
Says the Nature Conservancy's Dennis: "When you're talking about an ecosystem, 
you could be talking about anything from 5,000 acres to 500 square miles." 
</P>
<P>
So he outlines a compromise, a core that the conservationists want to own and 
manage. Around that they would establish a larger area where timbering and 
mining are banned. "Then you may want an additional buffer where development is 
OK, but it's got to be limited. You may allow a cluster of homes here on 2- to 
5-acre tracts and preserve farmland over there." 
</P>
<P>
Even individuals are taking a page from their book and designing small local 
operations to save such properties as a farm in Virginia or 400 acres of 
rolling countryside in Connecticut. The farm remained a farm, and the 
Connecticut tract is now home to an organically safe golf course. 
</P>
<P>
In the array of people in the conservation army, there is also an array of 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy's 542,000 members, dedicated to preserving habitats, 
have financed a $600-million organization that has saved almost 4 million 
sensitive acres since it was founded in 1953. It has 1,000 employees and 
probably 10,000 volunteers and covers every state. 
</P>
<P>
Considerably younger (10 years old) and smaller (a staff of 30 nationwide) is 
the American Farmland Trust, dedicated to saving the nation's farms and 
improving farming techniques. Yet, it churns accounts of more than $2 million 
to get more acres for the buck. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the debt burden in agriculture," says the trust's 
president, Ralph Grossi. "Many farmers are going out of business and their land 
isn't being cared for adequately." 
</P>
<P>
Organizations from the National Wildlife Federation to the Audubon Society, 
from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Ducks Unlimited, a hunter's group, 
often find themselves working in concert. 
</P>
<P>
They all have one thing in common. They can move more quickly than local or 
state governments can and, using charitable tax benefits, they can bring in a 
deal cheaper than developers can. 
</P>
<P>
By stripping a piece of land of development rights, it is not only protected 
regardless of who owns it, but income tax benefits can either bring the owner a 
sizable tax deduction or provide instant cash for a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
It also reduces the value of the land and hence its tax assessment, which 
deprives the county or state of some tax revenue. But counties and states 
usually are willing to forgo taxes on some property to enhance the value of 
land around it. 
</P>
<P>
Witness New York's Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has asked for $1.9 billion to set 
aside areas of the Empire State for scenic and recreation purposes. California 
has provided more than $700 million for similar purposes, and Florida has an 
active land acquisition program. 
</P>
<P>
But the smallest of communities can be stirred to action. Michigan's west coast 
is a beautiful blend of dunes, orchards and sandy beaches on Lake Michigan. It 
is a magnet for those wanting second homes, and unlike the coast of California, 
which it mimics in miniature, it has no coastal commission to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
Local land trusts, with the help of the Farmland Trust, moved in to buy a 
507-acre farm on the Old Mission Peninsula, blocking any further residential 
development. It will remain an orchard in an area that prides itself as being 
the "Cherry Capital of the World." 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that some crops will be grown in any quantity in the United 
States 30 to 40 years from now," says Grossi of the Farmland Trust. "The 
growing areas that are required, the climate, the soil, the weather, those 
unique values are essentially the same as those that attract people."

   International pressure is mounting
on Brazil to preserve its fast-disappearing Amazon rain forest, but
the debt-ridden South American nation continues to resist what it
considers to be foreign meddling.
   There is growing concern worldwide that destruction of the 2
million-square-mile rain forest, the world's largest and
fastest-disappearing, could change global weather with potentially
disastrous consequences.
   Satellite photos of the Amazon show that in the past 10 years, an
area the size of Belgium has been slashed, burned and mined away.
About 9 percent of the region is irreparably damaged, said
researcher Philip M. Fearnside.
   But ecologists charge that the government has done little to
discourage uncontrolled destruction.
   In January, a U.S. congressional delegation led by Sen. Timothy
Wirth, D-Colo., met with President Jose Sarney to discuss swapping
part of Brazil's $115 billion debt for preserving Amazon land.
France and the Netherlands have made similar proposals, involving
creating an international commission to oversee the forest that
covers two-thirds of Brazil and is home to 15 million people.
   All received the same answer _ Brazil won't be told what to do.
   ``We can't turn the Amazon into a sort of national park for
humanity. Our priority is economic development. We're open to
international suggestions but not those that interfere in Brazilian
sovereignty,'' Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreu Sodre said recently.
   ``We can't be condemned to having a large part of our territory
prevented from being developed, particularly when the developed
world is responsible for the world's greatest ecological
disasters,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima.
   Over the past two decades, the government has given cattle
ranchers tax breaks and other indirect subsidies totaling about $2
billion, even though studies show most of the Amazon is unsuited to
ranching or farming.
   The tropical soil is extremely fragile. When the protective
forest canopy is burned, nutrients wash away in the heavy rains.
   ``A typical field won't stand more than two crops, and a cattle
pasture lasts not more than a decade,'' said Fearnside, a professor
at the Amazonia Research Institute in Manaus, the principal Amazon
city. ``Only about 15 percent of the Amazon soil is suitable for
conventional farming.''
   In addition, much of the land has been cleared and burned by
farmers and by land speculators hoping for a better price for
homesteaded property, he said.
   Satellite photos of thousands of fires set by farmers and
developers drew world attention last year, as did the December
slaying of internationally known ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
Mendes.
   The leader of a local rubber tappers union, Mendes fought to keep
ranchers from cutting down the jungle for pasture. He had called for
more harvesting of Amazon resources such as nuts, latex and plants,
while preserving the trees.
   Four people, including the son of a rancher, have been arrested.
   In a nation where 60 percent of the people survive on less than
$90 a month, ecologists and politicians argue that the Amazon has
not created enough jobs to justify the destruction and its future
consequences.
   ``The idea that you tear down the rain forest to create jobs is
not sound,'' Wirth said. ``To send a lot of people out there to
settle the Amazon just doesn't work.''
   In the 1920s, auto magnate Henry Ford failed in a scheme to
cultivate rubber trees in a vast area now known as ``Fordlandia.''
Decades later, in the 1960s and '70s, shipping magnate Daniel Ludwig
lost a reported $1 billion in an ambitious plan to produce wood pulp
and rice on the Amazon's Jari River.
   ``Vast areas of the Amazon have been devastated and the poverty
is no less,'' said Artur Virgilio, mayor of Manaus. ``Only the
wealthy have so far benefited from the destruction.''
   Foreign groups have said they would pressure international
financial institutions not to release new funding for Amazon-related
projects. The World Bank, which has loaned Brazil $15 billion since
1949 for energy-related and development projects, is a principal
target.
   For example, environmental groups have urged the World Bank to
reject a $500 million loan that would help Brazil refinance some
debt from construction of dams and power plants. They say Brazil
would use some of the money for new projects instead of for
balancing payments on other loans.
   But this month, Brazil and the World Bank announced a proposed $1
billion loan for electric power development. Details of the proposed
loan, to be spread out over 18 months, were not disclosed pending
further negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
The sprawling, air-conditioned hotel at the edge of the Amazon forest teemed 
with ideas for saving the world's biggest tropical wilderness. It was a 
flourishing ecosystem of ideas, with the exuberance of a triple-canopy jungle, 
some ideas like towering trees, others like dense undergrowth and entwining 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
They sprouted from the mouths of conservationists, researchers, government 
technicians and officials; they blossomed from photocopied treatises, slide 
projectors and posters; they germinated on note pads and paper napkins. The 
lush proliferation of ideas left no doubt that an international conference 
called "Forest 90" was a fertile theoretical environment. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
Dirigibles will float over the wilderness, lowering in loggers to cut mature 
hardwood trees with as little damage to the forest as possible. New trees will 
be planted to replace the harvested ones, which will be hoisted into the sky 
and carried to nearby rivers, then floated to distant sawmills. No more logging 
roads slicing destructively through the fragile flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Forest dwellers will not only tap rubber and gather Brazil nuts, as they do 
today, but also will collect foods, medicinal plants, gums, fibers, dyes, oils 
and other products for marketing in Brazil and abroad. Useful species will be 
reseeded. In riverside settlements, processing plants and cottage industries 
will turn forest products into finished goods, providing needed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural extension workers will help farmers cultivate combinations of 
trees that yield profitable crops on small plots, protecting the land from the 
erosion and hardening that can occur when the forest is removed. This sustained 
"agroforestry" will render unnecessary the slash-and-burn farming methods that 
have already destroyed so much native forest. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners will raise big, fast-growing Amazon fish in ponds covering a few 
acres, earning much more than they could by raising cattle on large tracts of 
cleared land. Waste from chicken coops at the edge of the water will feed the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Two million Amazon colonos, pioneer farmers from other parts of Brazil, have 
shown how the imperative of economic survival can devour virgin forest. Most 
colonos begin by planting traditional subsistence crops such as beans, corn and 
an abundant root crop called manioc on cleared forest land. When the soil wears 
out in two or three years, they clear more land. More rain forest disappears. 
</P>
<P>
Saving the forest, it was clear here, is not only a matter of curbing rapacious 
ranchers, but also of offering small farmers economic alternatives to 
destructive methods. 
</P>
<P>
Like the vast rain forest itself, the ideas for weaning farmers from the 
slash-and-burn cycle seemed to have no end. 
</P>
<P>
Plant manioc in combination with nitrogen-fixing legumes that will replenish 
and protect weak soils. Exploit unwooded river flood plains with intensive 
cultivation of rice or super-grasses to feed livestock. Grow shade-seeking 
perennial crops, such as pepper and cacao, under otherwise useless secondary 
forest growth, capoeira, on the deforested land. Develop more productive 
agroforestry "consortiums" of different crop trees that thrive together. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to "fix the man on the land" with a sustainable system of 
production. "For every year this person doesn't have to move, it means 'X' 
number of acres that aren't cleared," said John Butler, a consultant with the 
World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
But Forest 90's 1,200 participants -- environmentalists and government 
officials -- well knew that as deforestation chews away at Brazil's Amazon 
region, ideas alone will not save the unmatched diversity of its myriad plants 
and animals. 
</P>
<P>
While the impressive flood of ideas offered hope for the Amazon, it also 
underlined a difficult challenge: A monumental effort is needed to sort out the 
various forest-saving possibilities and to put them into widespread practice. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the goal, new techniques must be taught, and other assistance 
delivered, to a rural population of 5 million in an area nearly three times as 
large as Alaska. That could require an army of agricultural extension agents. 
Currently, few results of Amazon agricultural research reach farmers in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Luiz Carlos Molion, a Brazilian climatologist and forest hydrologist, served 
himself a few chunks of river fish from the hotel's luncheon buffet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tambaqui, but it's undersized," said Molion, 43, a stout man with a 
ruddy face and scraggly russet beard. "They're taking small fish from the 
rivers because the big ones are being fished out." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for tambaqui and other Amazon fish is high: A kilogram of tambaqui costs 
more than a kilogram of beef in Manaus, a city of more than a million people. 
Molion and others who know the Amazon say fish-raising in ponds could become a 
major source of food and income for the region's people, with a low ecological 
cost. But so far, little has been done to implement the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Leonir Naumann is an exception rather than the rule. He operates a farm near 
the village of Bela Vista, 40 miles west of Manaus on the Upper Amazon River. 
And on his farm he has a fishpond, full of maturing tambaqui, tucunare and 
pirarucu. 
</P>
<P>
Naumann, 33, walked along the shore and pointed to fish breaking the pond's 
surface. He said he soon will take his first catch to market and his farm will 
begin to turn a profit for the first time in the 10 years he has owned it. He 
also has 135 head of dairy cattle, but he said poor Amazon soil makes pasture 
maintenance too expensive to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
He wore sandals and blue shorts, and his tanned shoulders shone like copper 
under the midday sun as he stopped to make a simple calculation: Each cow 
requires 2.5 acres of grazing land, but 2.5 acres of fishpond will produce more 
than 150,000 pounds of tambaqui in three years. He feeds the fish dried cow 
manure and manioc -- a crop he also fertilizes with manure. 
</P>
<P>
About 740 acres of forest has been cleared from Naumann's 4,300 acres of land, 
and he said he will cut no more. "I am against deforestation," he said. "There 
is a lot of deforested land and it isn't being used." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 square miles of Brazil's Amazon forest has been razed for 
pasture, an area larger than Oregon. An estimated two-thirds of that has 
degenerated into brush and the secondary forest growth, capoeira. 
</P>
<P>
Agroforestry has proved to be one of the most productive uses of cleared Amazon 
land. Over the years, Sebastiao Silva Martins, 65, has planted a small jungle 
on his plot outside Bela Vista. His trees produce rubber, cacao, oranges, 
passion fruit, mangoes, palm peaches and cupuacu. Some thrive in the shade; 
others grow high, seeking sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The trees protect the fragile soil from hardening and erosion. They produce 
year after year. The tree farm doesn't require much work, and Martins doesn't 
have to spend money on such things as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fertilizer is just the leaves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Naumann, Martins gets no help from agricultural extension workers or 
ecologists. He has learned which combinations of trees work best from talking 
with his neighbors and experimenting. In his small way, he has demonstrated 
that farming in the Amazon need not destroy the forest. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest controversy at the conference was about "extractive reserves" -- 
forest areas set aside for residents to exploit without destroying them. The 
government has created four extractive reserves with a total of 5.4 million 
acres and others are being planned. But debate goes on over whether they will 
be economically sustainable in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said prices for forest products such as natural latex, nuts and herbs 
cannot adequately compensate for the time it takes to gather them. They 
contended that when demand increases for a forest product, it will be depleted 
-- or domesticated for more economical production on farms. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the concept argued that markets for new products must be 
developed. They predicted that the forest's hundreds of thousands of plant 
species, many of them yet to be studied, will be a cornucopia of marketable new 
material. And they said forest areas can be "enriched" by planting. 
</P>
<P>
Americans interested in rain-forest conservation already have begun buying ice 
cream and other products made with Amazon ingredients. Some conference 
participants envisioned a boom in demand for "rain-forest chic" products. 
</P>
<P>
"Either we find ways to preserve the forest and improve the lives of the people 
there, or 20 or 30 years from now there won't be any more researchers 
researching the forest, because there won't be any forest," said Julio Barbosa, 
a rubber-tappers union leader. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and government officials at Forest 90 agreed that the Amazon 
should be zoned for forest preservation and controlled development. Jose 
Goldemberg, the national secretary of science and technology, said a regional 
zoning plan is being prepared and will be finished by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Alcir Meira, superintendent of the official Amazon development agency, said the 
agency is drafting its sixth plan for the region. The agency, known by the 
acronym SUDAM, dedicated much of its efforts in the past to fostering big 
cattle ranching projects in the Amazon, granting tax concessions and other 
incentives. But Meira said the new plan will emphasize ecological balance. 
</P>
<P>
"What it will not permit anymore is to give incentives for cutting down forest 
for ranching," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Molion, the forest hydrologist, is creating a new Amazon agency called Unitrop 
that will distribute donated funds for research on ecologically compatible 
development and for extension work. He said one of the first projects to be 
sponsored by Unitrop will distribute minnows and teach farmers to operate 
commercial fishponds. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to cut the forest to plant and harvest it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That, in essence, is the gospel according to Forest 90. The future of the 
Amazon may rest largely on whether its message is heard.

<HEAD>Brazil Says It Needs $2.2 Billion a Year to Save the Amazon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it needs
$2.2 billion a year in aid from industrialized countries to stop
the destruction of the Amazon, the world's largest wilderness.
   Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg said the money
would be used to replant deforested areas, relocate settlers and
patrol the Amazon to stop slash-and-burn devastation of the vast
jungle.
   Scientists say slash-and-burn destruction of Amazon rain forest
by ranchers and farmers releases carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
and adds to the greenhouse effect, which increases the Earth's
temperature.
   ``This wouldn't be charity,'' Goldemberg told The Associated
Press. ``The developed countries would be defending their own
interests by stopping the global warming.''
   An average of 8,700 square miles of rain forest has been cut and
burned each year since 1978, or about 8 percent of the
2-million-square-mile wilderness, Goldemberg said.
   He said the data was obtained from Brazil's Space Research
Institute, based on 222 Landsat satellite photos of the rain forest.
   Earlier estimates of Amazon destruction had ranged from 5 to 20
percent.

Environmentalist Hysteria May Hasten Amazon's Destruction

    International criticism
of the Brazilian government's efforts to continue opening up
this tropical-forest region for migrant settlers is at a
fever pitch. Environmental groups, the U.S. government and
even "60 Minutes" have weighed in to condemn, usually without
qualification, the large-scale tropical-forest destruction
accompanying the huge Polonoroeste development project in
Rondonia and the ongoing 300-mile extension of the paved road
from Porto Velho to Rio Branco in Acre.
   Bowing to this pressure, both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have formally protested the Brazilian government's failure to adhere to environmental-protection policies. 
During World Bank meetings two weeks ago, environmental lobbyists demanded a cutoff of multimillion-dollar loans to development projects in this vast Amazonian region. 
So far, there have been minor steps in this direction, but no long-term, permanent action. 

   This organized international campaign has highlighted issues of critical importance for the future of the world's greatest tropical rain forest. 
However, continued sweeping condemnations of the development programs that lead to forest clearing is a dangerous tactic. 
It actually could contribute to greater long-term forest and environmental destruction in the Amazon and threaten the economic well-being of hundreds of thousands of settlers who have migrated here in the past decade. 

   Clearly, the development that has taken place has made a mess of things. 
Landsat photos show that about 20% of the state of Rondonia -- an area almost as large as West Virginia -- was deforested between 1980 and 1987. 
This resulted primarily from land clearing associated with Polonoroeste settlement efforts or spontaneous settlements facilitated by the opening of Route 364 between Cuiaba, Mato Grosso and Porto Velho, Rondonia. 
Wanton forest destruction, land degradation and soil erosion have been well documented, even by the government. 
Provisions for environmental protection have been largely ignored in construction along Route 364. 
Even where they exist, forest reserves, national parks and Indian reserve boundaries are routinely violated for timber and mineral exploitation. 

   Despite this abysmal record, what is needed to slow the wave of forest destruction in parts of Rondonia and Acre not suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching is more -- not less -- investment capital for agriculture and more road improvement within already established project areas and along existing transportation arteries. 
Providing these investments to ensure the availability of adequate farm inputs, technical assistance and transportation to markets is critical for stabilizing and intensifying agriculture in the areas already shorn of their forest cover. 

   The original conception of Polonoroeste envisioned creation of a large, decentralized community of relatively self-sufficient pioneer farmers along a central corridor through Rondonia. 
In reality, the community has turned out much differently. 
Urban dwellers and peasant farmers who migrated here in recent years from the south of Brazil burned the forest, planted a crop of manioc, which can be planted and harvested quickly, unlike coffee trees, which take years; they followed subsequently with the requisite rice, beans and squash. 
But they have seen their harvests decrease each year as soil fertility has declined. 
Environmentalists correctly point out that many of these colonists are on the move again, seeking new lands to subject to the same debilitating cycle, especially in new areas being opened up in distant Acre. 

   Many Brazilian agricultural-development experts now realize that the type of farming likely to be economically and ecologically sustainable in the cleared areas of Rondonia does not revolve solely around subsistence crops, but also must include intensive cultivation of perennial bush and tree crops (such as coffee, nuts, cocoa and rubber). 
This type of agriculture requires more capital inputs and better transportation for marketing, but it is more likely to protect soil fertility and produce a surplus for small farmers in the long term. 

   Polonoroeste officials say that those areas closest to Route 364 have moved into this second phase of agricultural development. 
Also, the average lot size maintained by each family in these areas is considerably smaller than was originally given to settlers. 
That is, rural population density is increasing, and farmers are making a living on smaller plots of land because they are using the land more intensively. (This contrasts with the trend in areas where land is being exhausted; here holdings are being consolidated into large and unproductive cattle ranches.) 

   Over time, this more intensive land-use pattern, if it can be sustained, will decrease the unit costs of providing public services, stimulate a more active rural trading system, encourage closer economic ties between rural areas and rapidly expanding urban areas and reduce the strain on the remaining forested areas. 

   To send the nearly one million settlers who have migrated here in recent years back to the poverty and landlessness they faced in the south and the northeast of Brazil would be virtually impossible. 
Thus, conservation of undeveloped areas requires greatly increased investment and technical assistance to turn the settlers into better and more intensive farmers and conscious stewards of the land. 
To attain their goal of protecting the remaining tropical forests of Rondonia and Acre, Brazilian and international conservationists must develop much stronger lobbying for policies that promote investment in sustainable agriculture and forestry development. 

   International pressure to halt or slow the paving of Route 364 or to terminate agricultural investment in areas where soils can support crops could have serious repercussions for the environment and for the poor farmers who now consider this region their home.

<TEXT>
   In a quiet, though dramatic,
reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help
to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction.
   The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations
proposal to swap some of its $112-billion foreign debt for
investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and
West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by
burning, to the huge rain forest.
   In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local
authorities to police the jungle. Then it said yes to a project
backed by the United Nations and by private American companies to
establish a 1.1 million-acre protected forest area to produce rubber
and nuts.
   The moves represent a sharp reversal in President Jose Sarney's
Amazon policy, which in the past considered offers by foreigners as
attempts to take control of the rain forest from Brazil.
   ``We cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to
create here,'' Sarney told reporters in March, after France, the
Netherlands and two U.S. congressional delegations suggested trading
some Brazilian foreign debt, the Third World's largest, for Amazon
preservation.
   But analysts say subtle shifts in political, social and economic
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind.
   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,
opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicist
Jose Goldemberg in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper recently.
   There is belief here that Sarney, widely discredited for his
inability to check 1,004 percent annual inflation, talked tough in
the past to placate right-wing supporters.
   But with his center-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party in
splinters and the country's first popular presidential election
since 1960 set for Nov. 15, Sarney might now be resigned to accept
foreign aid, the analysts say.
   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks the
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through
Congress,'' Rene Dreifuss, a political scientist at the Fluminense
University in Rio, told The Associated Press. ``It has no choice but
to accept help from abroad.''
   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has undermined
Brazil's trade links abroad.
   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the Amazon,'' Sen.
Leopoldo Peres, a member of the Democratic Movement and president of
a Senate committee on Amazon deforestation, said in an interview.
``American and European banks and lending organizations started
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''
   Environmentalists pressured the European Economic Community to
ban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, a
huge metallurgy project in Para, a state in the Amazon region.
   Recently, trade officials from Belgium, West Germany and Britain
visited the 200 million-acre, $70 billion project, where thousands
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the Amazon River
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.
   A Rio de Janeiro city councilman, Alfredo Sirkis of Brazil's
Green Party, contends Sarney first stiffened on the Amazon issue
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
Mendes.
   Mendes, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the
forest for pasture, was killed last December outside his modest home
in a backwoods Amazon town.
   ``All of a sudden Chico was all over the front pages, and U.S.
senators were showing up to talk about saving the Amazon,'' Sirkis
said. ``It irritated the military, and Sarney reacted by turning it
into a sovereignty issue.''
   But the British rock star Sting met with Sarney in January and
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for
an Indian reservation.
   In February, Indian tribes of the eastern Amazon Basin organized
the first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking World
Bank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the Amazon
region.
   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that
uncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million square-mile Amazon forest
_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changing
global weather patterns.
   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the Amazon also is
destroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, and
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the Earth's atmosphere.
   Satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of Brazil's rain
forest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbon
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as
the greenhouse effect.
   By April, the first visible sign of change came when Sarney
announced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.
   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of tax
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight
the burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservations
and an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled the
sale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-area
rivers by freelance gold prospectors.
   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, the
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' Flavio Feldmann
of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, a vocal ecology defender,
told a reporter.
   On July 5, Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu de Sodre signed a
memorandum of understanding with Britain to tackle ``urban and
industrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, and
forestry management.''
   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states
to administer their natural heritage,'' said Abreu de Sodre.
   In August, Brazil accepted $65.5 million in grants and loans from
West Germany for conservation projects in the Amazon over three
years.
   After this, the Inter-American Development Bank said it would
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more
to foreign technological and financial help, although some seemingly
remain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''
   But Christopher Patten, Britain's minister of overseas
development, a recent visitor to Brazil, said, ``Environmental
problems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved by
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''

<HEAD>Rubber Tapper Says Plotters of Chico Mendes Killing Still at Large
^By PETER MUELLO
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A successor to slain Amazon
environmentalist Chico Mendes says the men who planned that killing
continue to threaten witnesses and rubber tappers.
   Osmarino Amancio Rodrigues, 33, said Tuesday that rubber tappers
believe a group of businessmen and ranchers masterminded the Mendes
shooting but were never called to testify in the case.
   ``The head of the snake was not hit,'' Rodrigues told a group of
foreign journalists. ``Those who planned it are still at large.''
   Mendes, a rubber tapper who led a movement to stop destruction
of the rain forest, was shot to death on Dec. 22, 1988, at his home
in the western Amazon town of Xapuri.
   A cattle rancher and his sons were arrested for the shooting.
They have not yet been brought to trial.
   Rodrigues said four rubber tappers have been shot to death in
the region since Mendes was slain. One victim, Jose Brito, had been
slated to testify in the trial.
   ``He was going to testify how Chico Mendes' death was planned,''
Rodrigues said. ``But two guys on a motorcycle shot him down right
on the street.''
   Those who oppose the ranchers get frequent anonymous death
threats, he said: ``They call up and say, `Is Chico Mendes OK?
How'd you like to be ``OK'' like Chico?'''
   A prime target is Rodrigues himself, he said. As president of
the rubber tappers union in Brasileia, near Xapuri, he has emerged
as a leader of conservationist movement, carrying on Mendes'
struggle to save the Amazon jungle from destruction.
   Rodrigues is constantly accompanied by four union bodyguards
plus a police escort but said he still doesn't feel safe.
   He sharply criticized the Amazon policy of President Fernando
Collor de Mello, who took office in March.
   Collor got high marks from conservationists for nominating
renowned ecologist Jose Lutzenberger as Environment Secretary and
ordering the expulsion of gold miners from Indian reservations.
   But Rodrigues said there have been few practical results.
   Rodrigues said the government must learn that the rain forest
can be profitably developed without destroying it. Slash-and-burn
clearing by ranchers and farmers has destroyed an estimated 8
percent of the 2 million-square-mile Amazon wilderness.
   Rubber, Brazil nuts, cocoa and tropical fruits are abundant in
the Amazon but often rot for lack of processing or transportation,
he said.
   Rodrigues has toured Europe and the United States to raise money
for the conservation movement. Despite many pledges of funds, not a
cent has reached Brazil yet, he said.
   Foreign aid will help environmentalists stand up to ranchers,
mining interests and loggers who buy the votes of the poor and
control local politics, Rodrigues said.

EXPERTS MAP STRATEGY TO CONTROL DEVELOPMENT IN AMAZON RAIN FOREST 
</P>

<P>
The chaotic development that is gobbling up the Amazon rain forest could 
finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of Amazon countries 
and leading scientists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain forest in 
recent years," said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist at the Smithsonian 
Institution and an Amazon specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about 
conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil, except bad news," Lovejoy 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest, lies in 
Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight surrounding countries. 
</P>
<P>
Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in mid-January in 
Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people in the heart of the 
Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's once-thriving rubber trade. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which brought together all the governments and scientists with 
interests in the rain forest, culminated with a plan to regulate development in 
up to 80% of the Amazon region. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon had met to 
pool their knowledge and agree on conservation priorities, the meeting's 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has broad 
government support and is likely to serve as a guide for national conservation 
programs, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called multiple-use 
development, which preserves the forest while allowing tourism and the 
commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by developers and 
peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle ranching or farming, has been 
ambivalent about the need to conserve the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the setting of 
priorities was "all done with the blessing of Brazil," Lovejoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands of plant and 
animal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30% of the world's plant and animal 
species. 
</P>
<P>
One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken from the deep 
shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants representing 50 species. 
</P>
<P>
Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor are home to 
countless birds and insects that live their lives without ever setting foot on 
the ground. One group of orchid species grows only near the top of the canopy; 
an entirely different collection of orchids grows at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small groups to assess 
conservation priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the stinging ant that 
defends acacia trees against predators. Mammalogists took inventory of the 
Amazon's screeching monkeys. Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the 
fish that eats fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it 
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the Amazon. When they 
were done, the areas determined to be worth saving covered 70% to 80% of the 
Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no way of getting 
around that," said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International 
and an authority on endangered monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic goals for the 
establishment of national parks and reserves, along with multiple-use areas 
where some development could occur. 
</P>
<P>
It is not realistic to build a fence around 70% to 80% of the Amazon, he said. 
Only the most critical areas should be placed off limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten (percent) to 20% of the entire Amazon should be in protected parks or 
preserves, ideally," he said. At present, 2% of the Amazon is protected. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards the work that has 
got to be done," said Stanley Malone, director of the Suriname Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978 to develop a 
unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone said. What the officials 
lacked, however, was a guide to which areas most need protection. 
</P>
<P>
That determination has now been made, based on the number of different species 
a given area contains, and on how many of those species are unique to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll have to see what develops from this," Mittermeier said. A new 
Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, was inaugurated this month, and 
with him comes a new Brazilian environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is uncertain. "As 
always, everything depends on key individuals," Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically always optimistic," he said. "I feel sure that we can develop 
appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of work."

<TEXT>
   This year's mild winter could come back to
haunt Americans in the form of a drought, the National Weather
Service said Thursday.
   The March hydrological outlook, usually an annual report on
potential for spring flooding from snowmelt, this year is more a
chronicle of missing snow and dry soil conditions.
   Unless heavy precipitation occurs, the return of drought to
major areas of the nation is imminent, the report said.
   Drought plagued much of the nation in the hot summer of 1988,
easing somewhat last year. Pockets of dryness have persisted,
however.
   Serious water-supply problems are a distinct possibility for
much of California as well as in the Great Basin, lower Colorado,
parts of the Rio Grande and in western and southern Texas, the
weather service reported.
   Low stream flow, low soil moisture and low spring flood
potential also cover a large area of the north central states, the
report said.
   Parts of many central and western states have experienced
abnormally dry conditions for two to four years, resulting on dry
conditions deep in the soil.
   The threat of snowmelt flooding, meanwhile, is limited to small
areas of the country.
   Flood threat is above normal in a strip of northwestern Montana
and northeastern Idaho.
   But snow cover in the eastern two-thirds of the country is
minimal and where there is snow it is below average, except in
northern Maine and northern Michigan. Some portions of the central
states have reported high streamflows.
   A notable exception to the dry conditions is in south-central
Alaska, which has had a record snowfall. The melt there is still
weeks away, but that is a region where ice jams have created flood
danger in the past.

SLAIN BRAZILIAN BECOMES SYMBOL; 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE FOR HUGE AMAZON FOREST IS TURNING DEADLY 
</P>

XAPURI, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Francisco Mendes, 44, grew up in the forest and spent most of his life plying 
its shaded paths, gathering natural latex and Brazil nuts to earn a meager 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other rubber tappers in the Amazon basin, Mendes loved the 
peace and tranquillity of forest life. His conservation efforts earned him an 
international reputation -- and perhaps caused his death. 
</P>
<P>
When a 20-gauge shotgun blast killed Mendes last Dec. 22, Xapuri rubber tappers 
lost their leader -- and the Amazon conservation movement lost one of its most 
effective spokesmen. But here in Mendes' native state of Acre, rubber tappers 
and conservationists have much cause for hope. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what is happening in some other parts of the Amazon, where the 
forest is being slashed and burned at an alarming rate, those who want to save 
Acre's forest seem to be winning. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3,000 square miles of Xapuri township, for example, only 133 acres of 
forest were destroyed last year. In some cases, demonstrations organized by 
Mendes' Rural Workers Union stopped chain-saw crews before they could start 
cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the rate of deforestation has declined sharply in recent years, and 
the state government has adopted a policy that strongly discourages the 
conversion of forest into ranchland. Some officials in Rio Branco, the state 
capital, say that increasingly successful conservation efforts in Acre could 
serve as a model for the rest of the Amazon basin. 
</P>
<P>
The basin is drained by the biggest river system in the world and is blanketed 
by the Earth's largest tropical rain forest. Scientists say the forest plays a 
vital role in atmospheric and climatic conditions around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, the Amazon basin covers 2 million square miles, a region 12 times as 
large as California. According to rough estimates based on satellite surveys, 
as much as 30,000 square miles of virgin Amazon forest are being destroyed in 
Brazil every year as roadways, cattle ranching, farming, logging, mining and 
hydroelectric projects spread through the region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Isolated Area 
</P>
<P>
Acre, remote and isolated in Brazil's far west, has lost only 6% of its forest, 
which once virtually covered the state's 59,000 square miles. Most of Acre's 
deforestation has been on the eastern wing-tip of the butterfly-shaped state, 
around Rio Branco and along the road to Xapuri and Brasileia near the Bolivian 
border. A road network that was planned to lace the rest of Acre has not been 
built because of lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the state's territory is privately owned, and pressure is strong 
for spreading pastureland into the wilderness. It was this kind of pressure 
that Francisco Mendes was resisting. 
</P>
<P>
Known by the nickname Chico, Mendes was the son of a rubber tapper and began 
tapping rubber trees himself at age 9. He never went beyond fourth grade in 
school but received an informal education from a Communist and one-time army 
lieutenant who had participated in a ragtag rebel army's long march through 
Brazil's hinterlands in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a very good ideological base from that guy," said Gumersindo Rodrigues, 
29, who worked closely with Mendes in the union. Mendes helped found the union 
and served on the Xapuri municipal council in the late 1970s. He also founded a 
local branch of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party. For Mendes, the causes of 
socialism, unionism and ecology all placed him in direct opposition to the big 
landowners and ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rural Workers Union heard that a landowner had sent a crew to clear a 
piece of forest, the union would muster its members and their families to 
create an empate, or standoff. Dozens, even hundreds, of men, women and 
children would gather around the cutting crew and prevent it from starting the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killing Threatened 
</P>
<P>
In one such action last year, the union prevented brothers Alvarino and Darly 
Alves da Silva from starting work on a road into their isolated ranch outside 
the town of Xapuri. The ranchers had threatened to kill the union leader, 
Xapuri residents say. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes did not take it as an idle threat. He and Rodrigues, his friend and 
union associate, had learned of an outstanding warrant in the southern state of 
Parana charging the Alves da Silva brothers with ordering the killing of two 
rural workers there. Mendes and Rodrigues had the warrant transferred to 
Xapuri, and the brothers went into hiding. Mendes was put under police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Two police guards were eating a fish dinner in Mendes' rustic Xapuri home Dec. 
22 when Mendes opened the door on his way to take a shower in an outbuilding. 
Mendes was shot in the chest; he staggered back into the house and died. 
</P>
<P>
The police began looking for members of the Alves da Silva family. Darly and 
two of his sons turned themselves in. One of them, Darcy, confessed to pulling 
the trigger. The police are still searching the jungle for Alvarino Alves da 
Silva and three hired pistoleiros said to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brazil Nut Trees Survive 
</P>
<P>
Xapuri is about 50 miles from the border by the BR-317, a rutted, red-dirt road 
that becomes impassable after heavy rains. Most of the road from Xapuri to Rio 
Branco, a stretch of about 110 miles, is paved. It is flanked by ranches on 
rolling land, grassy pastures dotted with stumps and, occasionally, a 
green-topped castanheira, a Brazil nut tree. 
</P>
<P>
The castanheiras were left standing because government regulations prohibit 
their being cut down. But in isolation from the forest they are usually sterile 
-- towering but useless reminders of an ineffectual official gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Xapuri (pronounced shah-poo-REE) was once the capital of Acre, long before the 
territory became a state. Its brick and asphalt streets are lined with wood 
houses, many of them on stilts. One of the biggest buildings in town has been 
preserved as a landmark. It was the headquarters of the Bolivian provincial 
government before Brazil bought Acre in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rubber Barons 
</P>
<P>
That was at the time of the rubber boom, when Amazon latex fed burgeoning tire 
industries in the United States and Europe. Rubber barons made huge fortunes 
from the sticky sap that jungle workers painstakingly tapped from the trees, 
cutting groove after groove in a slanting pattern down the stout trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Tappers made their rounds on forest paths just as they do today. During the 
rainy season, they gather pods of Brazil nuts, and between seasons they 
cultivate corn, beans and cassava in small jungle clearings. Most tappers still 
live in thatch-roofed shacks deep in the forest, far from civilization. 
</P>
<P>
After the BR-317 came to Xapuri and cattle ranches began spreading out from the 
road, hundreds of rubber tappers were forced to abandon their source of 
livelihood, the forest. Others sold their tapping rights, discouraged by 
depressed rubber prices. Today, many former tappers live in the slums of Rio 
Branco, trying to make a living as unskilled laborers, but an estimated 120,000 
of the state's 380,000 people are still rubber tappers and their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resisting Ranchers 
</P>
<P>
The Rural Workers Union of Xapuri was formed to resist the encroachment of 
cattle ranching and to improve the lot of rubber tappers as well as ranch 
hands. Many of the tappers have little opportunity to participate in union 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The most distant ones stay out years and years without coming into town," 
Rodrigues said. But he said 600 of the estimated 3,000 rubber tappers in Xapuri 
township are active union members, dedicated to preserving the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"Between death from hunger in the city and death from fighting for the forest, 
we will die fighting for the forest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues and others who lived and worked with Mendes are clear about who their 
enemies are: the ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
"They meant to finish off the forest, and Chico defended it," said Mendes' 
widow, Ilzamar. "They didn't accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Gilson Pescador, a Xapuri labor organizer and former priest, said that Mendes' 
killing was planned as an attack on the conservation movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tree in the Cause 
</P>
<P>
"That was the motive, to end the movement, to end the resistance," Pescador 
told a visitor in the offices of the Workers' Party. 
</P>
<P>
Pescador wore a new T-shirt that said, "They cut down one of the leafiest trees 
in the Amazon cause and the union movement. Chico Mendes, from your example 
other bold plants will spring, until the entire Earth is green." 
</P>
<P>
In Rio Branco, landowner Sergio Figueiredo argued that there can be forest 
conservation in Acre along with the development of ranching and farming. 
</P>
<P>
"There is room for everyone here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The law limits landowners to clearing the forest from no more than 50% of their 
property, but Figueiredo said that an average of only about 20% of large 
ranches have been deforested. 
</P>
<P>
Figueiredo, 36, said that most Acre residents want new roads and increased food 
production, which would reduce the remote state's high cost of living and 
provide new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People 'Need to Be Fed' 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Acre, one of the most fertile parts of Brazil, cannot be kept 
just to be admired when there are residents who need to be fed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Figueiredo, the slaying of Mendes was the result of a "strictly 
personal" dispute between Mendes and the Alves da Silva family. Mendes' friends 
and associates say it was part of a violent conflict between rubber tappers and 
others who want to preserve the forest and ranchers who want to destroy it. The 
struggle has cost several other lives in Acre, they say. 
</P>
<P>
But Figueiredo said that when a rubber tapper is killed in a personal quarrel, 
"ranchers are always seen as the guilty ones. . . . There is a political 
interest in throwing the working class up against the landowner class." 
</P>
<P>
The ranchers' point of view was supported by the Acre state government until 
1986, when Flaviano Melo was elected governor. Melo, a member of the centrist 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, is the first governor in the Amazon region 
to adopt a clearly conservationist policy. His main adviser on economic 
development, Gilberto Siqueira, heads the Acre State Technological Foundation, 
which has drawn up a plan for exploiting the forest while preserving it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
22 Research Projects 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is conducting 22 research projects on forest management, use of 
forest products and technology for extraction. In addition to latex and Brazil 
nuts, Siqueira said, Acre's forests abound with valuable woods, oils, resins, 
fruits and medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ranchers' contention that Acre's soil is fertile, Siqueira said 
studies have shown that it is weak and not suitable for agriculture. He said 
much pastureland cleared in the 1970s will no longer support grass and is being 
taken over by weeds. 
</P>
<P>
The key to preserving the forest, according to Siqueira, is to make it 
economically productive. The state has recently created four "extractive 
reserves" totaling more than 700,000 acres that cannot be deforested. More 
reserves will be set aside, he said. At the same time, Siqueira's foundation is 
trying to bring about the creation of industries in Rio Branco that will use 
rubber, selected hardwoods and other forest products for manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in any ecological proposal that doesn't translate into an 
economic answer," he said in an interview. "You cannot preserve the forest and 
let it sit static."

RAINS STALL EFFORT TO MOVE PROSPECTORS OFF INDIAN LAND; 
</P>
<P>
BRAZIL: GOLD RUSH HAS BROUGHT HUNGER, DISEASE AND DEATH TO AN AMAZON BASIN 
TRIBE.

<P>
Heavy tropical rains are stalling a government effort to relocate thousands of 
gold prospectors who have illegally invaded tribal lands of Brazil's Yanomami 
Indians and endangered their pristine society, a Justice Ministry spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A gold rush that began in 1987 has lured the prospectors to large areas of 
Yanomami land, exposing the previously isolated Indians to diseases and 
disrupting their traditional means of livelihood. Sickness and hunger have 
spread, and pro-Indian organizations estimate deaths in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of the Yanomami has drawn international attention as an example of 
the harm that is befalling Brazil's 220,000 Indians with settlement of the 
Amazon wilderness. The search for gold on Yanomami lands, said to have yielded 
up to $1 billion, is part of a widespread rush that has drawn hundreds of 
thousands of prospectors into the Amazon River basin over the past several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Justice Minister Saul Ramos reached an agreement with prospectors' 
representatives for the voluntary evacuation of outsiders from areas designated 
as Yanomami tribal lands. In return, Ramos promised to push for the designation 
of areas where gold prospecting would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, the onset of seasonal downpours has all but stopped evacuation 
of prospectors from the Indian areas by light plane and helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"It is raining all day," said Ovidio Martins de Araujo, a Justice Ministry 
spokesman. "So we don't have any way of getting the prospectors out." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, 900 prospectors were ready and waiting for evacuation 
from a camp called Bahiano Formiga but aircraft were unable to land because of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
De Araujo said by telephone from Brasilia, the capital, that 18,000 to 20,000 
prospectors will be evacuated, but he gave no estimate of how long this will 
take. "It's going to depend a lot on the weather," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rainy season could continue into June in that part of the Amazon basin. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the Yanomami were believed to be the largest South American 
tribal group still isolated from outside society. Brazilian authorities 
currently estimate the number of Yanomamis in this country at 4,000, but 
unofficial estimates put the number as high as 10,000. Yanomamis are spread 
over a wilderness area of 36,000 square miles in the Brazilian states of 
Amazonas and Roraima, and also in southern Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Indian advocates have long claimed that the 36,000 square miles belong by 
tradition and law to the Yanomami. The area was once recognized as "Yanomami 
indigenous lands" by the government Indian agency, but in 1988 President Jose 
Sarney issued executive orders to create two national forests on nearly half of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Sarney administration designated 19 smaller areas with a total of 10,000 
square miles as traditional Yanomami tribal lands. Pro-Indian groups argue that 
the 19 areas and the two parks are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, federal police acting on a court order began operations aimed 
at removing gold prospectors from the 36,000-square-mile area. Last week, 
prospectors demonstrated in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, demanding access 
to at least part of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Ramos and other officials met with officials of the Amazon 
Prospectors Union, who promised that the prospectors would leave the 19 new 
Indian areas if they are permitted to extract gold from other parts of the 
36,000 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos promised government efforts to create two previously proposed prospecting 
areas with a total of 1,500 square miles within one of the newly created 
national forests. Ministry spokesman De Araujo emphasized that the prospectors 
must leave Indian areas first, but he acknowledged that the government is doing 
nothing to stop them from entering the two areas proposed for prospecting. 
</P>
<P>
Aldo Mongiano, the Catholic bishop of Boa Vista, predicted that the two 
proposed prospecting areas will not solve the problem. "The presence of the 
prospectors in those areas next to Indian villages should not be permitted, 
because it will be impossible to monitor them and prevent the prospectors from 
invading the Indian reserves again," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Abel de Barros Lima, legal representative of the Committee for the Creation of 
Yanomami Park, said the agreement with the prospectors is illegal because only 
an act of the Brazilian Congress can reclassify land within the 
36,000-square-mile area claimed for the Yanomamis. 
</P>
<P>
Lima said by telephone from Sao Paulo, where the committee is headquartered, 
that the Sarney administration is stalling for time so that it can pass the 
problem on to the administration of President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello, 
who takes office March 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that there is no will within the government to carry out the 
evacuation of the prospectors," Lima said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that to save the Yanomami Indians, the entire 36,000 square miles must 
be evacuated, not just the 19 newly designated Indian areas, which he called 
"islands." While the Indians live in the 19 areas, they need to move freely 
among them,to maintain their traditional customs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, malaria and other diseases spread by prospectors are 
rapidly undermining Indian health. Sickness decreases their ability to hunt and 
gather food, while contact with the outsiders increases their dependence on 
scarce commercial supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds and hundreds of Indians dying because of that invasion of 
prospectors," said Lima. "It is impossible to prevent the malaria and stop the 
genocide of the Yanomami if the prospectors are not removed."

<HEAD>Rubber Tappers, Environmentalists Celebrate Conviction in Mendes
Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>XAPURI, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The convictions and 19-year prison
sentences handed down for the murder of environmentalist Chico
Mendes are an important victory in the fight to preserve the
dwindling Amazon forest, rubber tappers say.
   ``This conviction is a landmark'' for environmentalists,
prosecutor Sueli Bellato said over the weekend.
   A seven-member jury determined late Saturday that rancher Darly
Alves da Silva planned the Dec. 22, 1988, slaying and that his son,
Darci Alves Pereira, fired the shotgun that killed the Amazon union
leader and rain forest defender.
   Prosecutors had said the ranchers had ``stained the forest''
with Mendes' blood and urged the maximum 30-year sentence. Brazil
has no death penalty.
   ``Now (landowners) know that every brother rubber tapper or
environmentalist who dies will be avenged,'' said Francisco Barbosa
de Aquino, president of the Rural Workers Union in this remote
town.
   Defense attorney Ruben Torres said his clients would appeal.
   Mendes, leader of the rubber tappers' union, became
internationally known in his fight against ranchers, who sought to
expand their pastures by cutting down the rain forest. The rubber
tappers gather latex from forest trees.
   He was gunned down on the back porch of his humble wooden house
in this backwoods Amazon river town 2,650 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   The four-day trial also drew world attention to a centuries-old
battle over land in Brazil that has left thousands of people dead.
Only too often, the perpetrators have gone unpunished.
   ``(The convictions) are an important victory not only for the
rubber tappers, but for all the rural workers' movements in
Brazil,'' Aquino said.
   The Amazon is the world's largest rain forest and the only
habitat for many plant and animal species. Rubber tappers depend on
the forest for their livelihood.
   Once the jungle is cleared it becomes barren of most vegetation
within a few years. The race for development and quick profits
wiped out vast swaths of the 2-million-square mile wilderness.
   Land reform is a deeply divisive issue in this nation of 150
million people, larger in area than the 48 continental United
States. Four percent of the population controls 60 percent of the
arable land, government surveys show.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15 as
Brazil's first freely elected leader since l960, promised to give
500,000 families land by 1994. But he has not moved to fulfill the
promise.
   As Brazil's economy crumbles, urban poor are flocking to the
Amazon to try to forge a new life on the frontier.
   Ranchers with little fear of reprisal from a corrupt justice
system hire ``pistol men'' for as little as $25 to kill peasants,
or the Roman Catholic priests and other leaders who organize them.
   Since 1980, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land
disputes in Brazil, according to surveys by the Pastoral Commission
for land.
   In the first 11 months of this year, 60 people died - most of
them poor farm hands - and 403 were injured in battles over land,
the commission says.
   Convictions were achieved in only two cases, the international
human rights organization Amensty International says.
   Satellite surveys show ranchers annually destroy an area the
size of Louisiana in the Amazon, which constitutes one-third third
of the world's remaining rain forest.

<HEAD>Study: Loss of Amazon Rain Forest Would Change Regional Climate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Removing the tropical rain forest from the
Amazon River basin of South America would change forever the
climate of that region and could affect the global weather, a new
study says.
   Once the trees are felled, said Jagadish Shukla, a professor of
meteorology at the University of Maryland, the famed dense jungle
forest along the Amazon River will be gone forever.
   ``You will never be able to regenerate the forests once you have
cut them,'' said Shukla, the co-author of a study appearing today
in the journal Science.
   Shukla said wiping out the Amazon River forest probably also
would affect the worldwide climate because it would change the
temperature of waters near the mouth of the river and perhaps
disrupt weather patterns affected by those waters.
   The scientist said a computer model of the effects of
deforestation along the Amazon River shows that rainfall would
decline by more than 26 percent, the average area temperature would
rise and evaporated moisture in the Amazon basin atmosphere would
decline by 30 percent.
   Loss of the trees would not turn the area into a desert,
although Shukla noted in an interview, ``We were tempted to say
that, but we didn't go that far.''
   The Amazon basin gets about 97 inches of rainfall a year.
Killing the tropical forest, he said, would reduce the annual
rainfall by about 25 inches.
   Once this new, drier pattern is established, the loss of the
Amazon basin forest would be irreversible, Shukla said.
   Global climate also could be affected, he said.
   The Amazon River dumps huge amounts of fresh water into the
Atlantic Ocean, which affects the delicate distribution of heat in
the ocean and in the atmosphere.
   By reducing the amount of rainfall over the Amazon Basin, Shukla
said, the amount of water carried to the Atlantic also would be
reduced.
   ``There would be tremendous changes in the chemistry and ecology
of the oceans,'' he said. ``It is very likely that there will be
very significant global effects on the climate.''
   It is not known precisely how the world's weather might change,
however, he said.
   Shukla and two colleagues at Maryland's Center for
Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions created a computer program that
tests the effects of Amazon deforestation. The computer model
enables the scientists to make the complex calculations necessary
to predict what would happen if the Amazon's trees were gone.
   The Amazon rain forest is the largest forest in the world and is
being destroyed at what Shukla called ``a devastatingly fast rate.''
   About 14,000 square miles of forest are cleared annually and
about 12 percent of the forest already is gone. Most of the
clearing is by slash-and-burn farmers who replace the trees with
crops and pasture.
   ``If deforestation were to continue at this rate, most of the
Amazonian tropical forests would disappear in 50 to 100 years,''
Shukla wrote.
   He said clearing the forest affects the regional climate in
three ways: removing the trees causes sunlight to heat up the soil
surface; loss of the trees significantly lowers the rate at which
water is evaporated into the atmosphere; and loss of the trees
disrupts the wind patterns that carry moist air over South America
from the oceans.
   About half of the Amazon basin rainfall comes from water that
has evaporated from the vegetation of the forest. Once the forest
is gone, Shukla said, it would close off this source of water vapor
for the rain clouds.
   Shukla said there weren't enough weather records in the area to
determine if the climate has already been changed by the 12 percent
of the trees that have been removed. However, studies have shown
that soil temperatures increased in the cleared areas and that
forest fires are more intense in periods of reduced rainfall.
   ``What is the critical size beyond which the climate changes and
we can't recover the forest? We simply don't know,'' Shukla said.
``Our study is limited to the total deforestation.''
   The study was co-authored by Carlos Nobre and Piers Sellers,
also of the University of Maryland at College Park.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

<TEXT>
   Marcos da Costa Pereira, a physicist with the space institute,
says, ``The burning of the Amazon is not only poisoning the
atmosphere and affecting the earth's ozone layer, it is also
reducing the rain forest's capacity to produce oxygen.''
   He says that although it is an exaggeration to call the Amazon
the ``lungs of the world,'' a phrase often found in press accounts,
the Brazilian jungle is a ``major contributor of the oxygen
breathed by mankind.''
   Along BR364, the 900-mile asphalt highway that slices through
the jungle to connect Porto Velho to Cuiaba, capital of the state
of Mato Grosso, the charred and still smoldering remains of once
majestic Brazil nut, rubber and brazilwood trees stand in mute
testimony to man's destructiveness.
   Along the highway, homesteaders, their faces blackened by trees
turned to charcoal, struggle to clear their land and plant crops
such as rice, corn and cassava before the rains come.
   Raimundo Nonato de Souza, 50, owns 123 acres of land about 60
miles outside Porto Velho. He burned about 50 acres to plant
cassava, a tropical root that yields a coarse flour and serves as
``bread'' for impoverished peasants.
   During a break from work, he wipes perspiration from his brow
with his forearm and says, ``This is the second time I have burned
this plot. Next year, nothing will grow on it, and I will have to
burn some more of my land.''
   Neither Souza, his 38-year-old wife, Raimunda, nor their two
young children have any idea what the greenhouse effect is all
about. But, expressing a kind of instinctive concern, the Brazilian
says, ``I know it's wrong to burn the jungle, but I have no other
choice. I have no money to buy a tractor, which would let me clear
the land without burning it.''
   Souza, like thousands of other homesteaders, received his plot
free of charge from the government. ``But before I could receive
title to my land, I was told I had to clear it off, and the best,
cheapest and fastest way to do so was to slash and burn.''
   Another peasant farmer, Oscar Fernandes, 48, asks, ``Where am I
supposed to grow the food to feed my family? On top of the trees?
If I don't cut down the forest and burn it, I will starve.''
   Catanhede, of the Brazilian Forest Service, says the worst
offenders are the owners of large cattle ranches who ``burn more
and more land each year to create pastureland to feed their growing
herds.
   ``After two or three burnings the land is completely depleted of
all its nutrients. Nothing will grow on it. The farmer then slashes
and burns some more virgin forest to continue growing crops, and
the cattle raiser does the same to get more pastureland.''
   The Forest Service tries to control the burnings by issuing
special licenses and setting limits on how much can be burned on a
given property.
   Penalties for burning without a license are fines equivalent to
$725 dollars per acre affected and prison sentences of up to one
year.
   But the law is widely flouted. Debt-ridden Brazil doesn't have
enough forest rangers or policemen to make the rules stick, and,
besides, most of the jungle burners couldn't afford the fines
anyway.
   ``What we would really like is to be able to enforce the law
that says a property owner must reforest the area he has
destroyed,'' Catanhede says. ``But with only 15 forest guards to
keep an eye over more than 90,000 rural properties in the entire
state and with no funds to increase our manpower, controlling the
burnings becomes an impossible task.''
   Francisco de Assis Araujo, head of Rondonia's Environmental
Protection Agency, says his office has been trying to educate
farmers to plant perennial crops such as coffee, cacao, and rubber,
mango and orange trees.
   ``The land would have to be slashed and burned only once to grow
such crops and thus repeated burnings and further destruction would
be avoided,'' he says.
   But homesteaders like Souza and Fernandes, who have little or no
education and who emigrated from other parts of Brazil where their
lives were even more wretched than in Rondonia, say they never
received any instructions or guidance from the government.
   Araujo says the Rondonia state government was about to implement
an ``agro-ecological zoning plan'' to specify which areas were
ecologically suitable for different agricultural activities and
cattle raising, thereby protecting, theoretically, the jungle from
unnecessary destruction.
   But he says Brazil's federal government, facing political
opposition because of a record 800 percent annual inflation rate,
views efforts to educate farmers about the proper use of the soil
as ``superfluous expenditures which just increase the public
deficit.''

<HEAD>Man Who Confessed in Ecologist's Death To Get Lie Detector Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who said he killed Amazon
ecologist Francisco Mendes will undergo a lie detector test to clear
up contradictions in his statements about the shooting, the Justice
Ministry said Monday.
   Deputy Justice Minister Luis Fernando Eichenberg told The
Associated Press that investigators have questions about the events
that preceded the Dec. 22 shooting. Mendes was shot as he stepped
from his home in the Amazon jungle city of Xapuri, 2,660 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Darcy Alves Pereira da Silva, 21, the son of a local cattle
rancher, said last Tuesday he killed Mendes, the president of the
local Rubber Tappers Union. Mendes challenged local ranchers, who
wanted to clear Amazon land for cattle grazing.
   But Eichenberg said, ``If he (Pereira da Silva) did shoot Mendes,
he didn't act alone. The lie detector test can help us eliminate
doubts.''
   Police said earlier that Pereira da Silva might be acting as a
cover for his father, Darly Alves da Silva, who Mendes had said
threatened to kill him.
   Pereira da Silva and his brother Oloci, 22, are being held in
police custody, but their father and their uncle, Alvarino Alves da
Silva, are in hiding, possibly in Bolivia, according to press
reports.
   ``That the Alves brothers may be hiding in Bolivia is a
hypothesis we are examining. If confirmed, we will begin extradition
procedings,'' Eichenberg said.
   Mendes received the United Nations Global 500 award for his
ecological work to preserve the Amazon forest. Ecologists say an
area the size of Belgium is burned and chopped down each year in the
jungle region that covers more than two-thirds of Brazilian
territory.
   Ecologists say the reduction in tropical forest lands has
contributed to the elevation of the Earth's temperature, which may
have been a factor in the devastating drought in the U.S. Midwest
this past summer.
   Mendes' death has drawn world attention to the old problem of
land conflicts between landless peasant farmers and right-wing
cattle ranchers.
   Since 1980, more than 1,000 peasants, ecologists and church
leaders, who defend the peasants, have been killed in battles over
land ownership in Brazil.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos MacArthur: "DPF Beats Records in Drug </F>
Seizures"] 
  [Text] For the Federal Police Department [DPF], 1993 was 
the year of drugs. The volume of drugs seized between January 
and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the 
big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine 
seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by 
the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the 
drug out of circulation. 
  According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase 
in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become 
the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and 
Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide 
range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports 
pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug 
in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many 
ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats 
or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be 
sold on the U.S. or European market. 
  Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest 
producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and 
Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack 
of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon 
Region, to transport the coca base. 
  In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with 
international organizations and foreign governments for the 
purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany, 
Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have 
been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign 
experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the 
results are visible in the considerable number of 
"mules"--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they 
boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro 
and Sao Paulo. 
<H5>  Operations Cover Entire Country </H5>
  Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not 
restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted 
in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two 
metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato 
Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in 
Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia. 
  And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu 
(Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice 
of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the 
region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which 
makes access and policing difficult. 
  The various operations taking place in 1993 included the 
destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco 
Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a 
little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known 
as "Monte Santo," "Ouricuri," and "Independence," took place 
with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate 
the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region. 
<H5>  Amphetamines Gaining Ground </H5>
  A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the 
appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market. 
Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the 
country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of 
laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more 
than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two 
illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the 
other in Florianopolis. 
  The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA, 
whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured 
on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the 
laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang 
with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande 
do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new 
escalation of drugs in our country. 
<H5>  Battle Against Illegal Prospecting </H5>
  The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action 
in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug 
traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation "Catrimani" 
arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a 
survey for the purpose of beginning Operation "Free Forest," 
which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations 
beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three 
aircraft and a large quantity of fuel. 
  The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency 
stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara 
Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the 
protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and 
cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were 
seized. 
  In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the 
year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the 
drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving 
underage girls forced into prostitution.

<H5>  Amphetamines Gaining Ground </H5>
  A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the 
appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market. 
Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the 
country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of 
laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more 
than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two 
illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the 
other in Florianopolis. 
  The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA, 
whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured 
on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the 
laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang 
with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande 
do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new 
escalation of drugs in our country. 
<H5>  Battle Against Illegal Prospecting </H5>
  The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action 
in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug 
traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation "Catrimani" 
arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a 
survey for the purpose of beginning Operation "Free Forest," 
which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations 
beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three 
aircraft and a large quantity of fuel. 
  The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency 
stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara 
Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the 
protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and 
cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were 
seized. 
  In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the 
year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the 
drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving 
underage girls forced into prostitution.

<TEXT>
   In the scarred, denuded hills northwest
of Hanoi, Vietnam is waging another war, one scientists say may
prove as crucial to its survival as those against the French and
Americans.
   Over large tracts of Vinh Phu, experimental efforts are under way
to regenerate forests that once covered most of the hilly province
and to persuade farmers to mix cash crops with trees that bind and
fertilize the soil.
   The lessons learned may help attain a national objective:
increase tree cover in the next few decades from the current 20
percent to 50 percent. Vo Quy, the country's leading
conservationist, says while the plan may be over-ambitious, not
succeeding could spell disaster.
   According to Quy, a biologist who helped develop Vietnam strategy
for national conservation, forces threatening the underpinnings of
Vietnam are at work.
   About 40 percent of the country is being raked by erosion, with
water rushing off denuded hills and carrying away tons of vital
topsoil. Agricultural land is already scarce, and Vietnam's
population, now 60 million, is growing at 2.4 percent a year.
   ``This task of restoring our environment is the biggest and most
important challenge facing Vietnam today,'' Quy said upon accepting
an award last year from the Switzerland-based World Wildlife Fund.
   Forced for decades to worry about falling bombs and empty rice
bowls, the Vietnamese and their neighbors in Cambodia and Laos
largely ignored the mounting ecological mayhem around them.
   Vast forests became firewood, and the land was turned into rice
paddies; wildlife was slaughtered by foraging armies and hungry
civilians. In Vietnam, the United States unleashed a new form of
warfare: chemical defoliation to deny communist guerrillas vital
forest sanctuaries.
   The wars have ended in all but Cambodia, but peace and a recent
opening to the outside world pose new dangers. Eager for rapid
economic growth but unable to pay for it, the three countries find
that among their most saleable commodities are the remaining forests.
   Japanese loggers _ widely criticized for despoiling Southeast
Asia's tropical forests _ have already gained a foothold in
Cambodia. Thailand, which banned domestic logging this year after
ravaging its own forests, is hungry for its neighbors' timber.
   Indochinese officials say controls will be placed to prevent
exploitation by outsiders, but their statements sound optimistic in
light of experiences elsewhere in the Third World.
   Western environmentalists contend that Japanese and Thai loggers
will try to buy off anyone who tries to stop them from cutting down
the forests.
   ``We are destroying our environmental balance,'' said Chea Kong
of Cambodia's Agricultural Ministry, estimating forest cover has
shrunk from 73 to 50 percent in his country over the past decade.
   Eradication of ``flooded forests'' adjacent Cambodia's Tonle Sap
lake has wiped out many fish breeding grounds and, in part, accounts
for the dramatic drop in catch in recent years.
   In an unprecedented speech last month, Prime Minister Kaysone
Phomvihane of Laos said deforestation had reached a ``dangerous
level'' and called for a ban on logging for export. He blamed
drought and floods on the forest felling, which he described as a
``crime against the next generation.''
   In all three countries, the large herds of wild animals
remembered by older residents have vanished. Tiger, elephant, gaur
and gibbon are among the endangered species; the Sumatran rhinoceros
and tapir are extinct.
   Vietnam probably faces the greatest problems. Since World War II,
when about half the country was under tree cover, the forests have
dwindled steadily. According to the Vietnamese, about 4.9 million
acres of forest were destroyed by herbicides and other U.S. military
actions.
   But since the war ended in 1975, even more woodland has been
destroyed by human encroachment.
   Some of Vietnam's countermeasures appear impressive, given the
shattered economy and little foreign aid for conservation.
   Quy said more than half a billion trees are being planted each
year with every student in the country obliged to take part. About
90 parks and conservation areas have been established, and a search
has begun to capture and breed the kouprey, an endangered species of
wild cattle that has become a symbol to conservationists in
Southeast Asia.
   But across Indochina, the ax and the gun are hard to stop.
Tribespeople in Laos strip entire mountainsides through their
migratory slash-and-burn farming, a tactic that wreaks environmental
havoc worldwide.
   ``It was easier to mobilize and sacrifice during the war,'' said
To Thinh, a district chief in Vinh Phu. ``It is harder to mobilize
people to save the environment.''

<TEXT>
   A team of visiting U.S. legislators has
proposed that Brazil convert portions of its foreign debt payments
to protect the Amazon jungle from deforestation, a foreign ministry
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Ruy Nogueira, said the American commission made
its proposals Friday to Brazilian President Jose Sarney during a
private session at his official residence in Brasilia.
   The team, composed of Sens. Timothy Wirth, Richard Shelby, John
Heinz and Reps. Gerry Sikorsky and John Bryant, is in Brazil on a
fact-finding mission that will include visits to the western states
of Amazonas, Rondonia and Acre.
   The proposals show an increased willingness on the part of
creditor nations to link new credit proposals with environmental
protection packages.
   Nogueira said the American delegation made no official
declarations, but sketched several proposals in which Brazil would
use portions of its foreign debt payments to create environmental
preservation projects in the western Amazon.
   Brazil is the Third World's leading debtor nation, with a foreign
debt of $115 billion.
   But in a meeting Friday at the foreign ministry, one government
representative told reporters it was ``unreasonable to insist that
Brazil pull back its development programs in the name of protecting
the environment.
   ``A developing country that has to create 1.7 million new jobs
per year and service debt cannot forgo the occupation of its
territory,'' said the sub-secretary of foreign relations, Paulo
Tarso Flecha de Lima.
   He said Brazil is studying how best to commercially develop the
Amazon without causing widespread ecological damage.
   But without debt relief from industrialized countries, occupying
the Amazon in a ``rational manner'' would be difficult.
   ``The international community must assist us with debt relief,
technical assistance and financial support,'' said Flecha de Lima.
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse of
tropical forest about two-thirds the size of continental United
States, has taken on international significance.
   Satellite inspection shows cattle ranchers and miners each year
chop or burn down an area the size of Belgium from the jungle, which
extends across 60 percent of Brazil's territory and contains 30
percent of the world's rainforest.
   Conservationists are worried about the ``greenhouse effect'' on
global climate from uncontrolled burning in the Amazon basin.
   The removal of oxygen-producing trees and release of noxious
gases into the atmosphere, some experts say, raises the earth's
temperature and could have been a factor in the summer 1988 drought
in the Midwest.

<HEAD>Drought Shifts East, Little Relief in Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The focus of the drought plaguing much of the
nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most
areas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
   The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,
dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
   Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts
along the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered
showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expected
to diminish.
   Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great
Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's
Climate Analysis Center reported.
   In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the
northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.
   A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope for
improvement. And a separate climate assessment added that many
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
   At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation was
undergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
   On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department announced sharp
reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the
water shortage _ and those projections were based on the assumption
of normal weather from here on, according to department officials.
   The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloud
over that assumption.
   The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and
includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and
Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. On the other
hand, western portions of the Mississippi Valley have received some
relief due to recent rains.
   The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal
temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western
Great Lakes region.
   The national picture shows the current drought to be about
equivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in
several years in the 1930s or 1956. However, in the Midwest, the
weather service reported that large areas have experienced the
driest April-June period on record since 1895.
   Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, but
nationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas are
expected to fall back to below average levels. Flows in many major
rivers remain low and continue to restrict navigation.
   Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,
however, the weather service noted.
   In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range
outlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain
hotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lower
Midwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies and
Great Basin. The only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the
nation's northwestern and northeastern corners and the
Louisiana-Texas-New Mexico area.
   Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,
although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward from
Texas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defenders of nature say the
appointment of Jose Lutzenberger, a noted ecologist, as Brazil's
environment minister could signal an end to wanton destruction of
the Amazon rain forest.
   The choice of Lutzenberger, 63, was seen as a victory for
conservationists, who claim the government has done little to stop
slash-and-burn devastation of the Amazon. He was named by President
Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15.
   By 1988, ranchers and farmers had destroyed about 8 percent of
the rain forest in the 2 million square miles of Amazon wilderness,
said U.S. researcher Philip Fearnside of the National Institute of
Research in the Amazon.
   Carbon dioxide produced by the burning is believed to add to the
``greenhouse effect'' warming the Earth's surface.
   ``Lutzenberger is the right man in the right place; nobody else
has his credibility,'' Johan Dalgas Frisch, head of the Wildlife
Preservation Association in Sao Paulo, said in an interview.
   Antonio Carlos de Oliveira of the ecology group Oikos said: ``He
is superimportant, a legend. We all have the greatest respect and
admiration for him.''
   Lutzenberger seeks radical changes in Brazil's environmental
policy. He favors solar, wind and other natural forms of energy
over the huge hydroelectric complexes of recent decades.
   A Rio newspaper made the wry comment that Lutzenberger was so
radical about protecting nature that he even opposed lawn mowers.
   The new environment minister told The Associated Press: ``We
have to question the fundamental doctrines of modern industrial
society, which is geared to the needs of the powerful. We're not
saying give up technology, but go a different way.''
   In his first week on the job, Lutzenberger spoke out against the
controversial Northern Rim project, which would create army posts
to guard Brazil's vast jungle border.
   He also promised to review a decision that allowed gold miners
to settle on land claimed by the primitive Yanomami Indians.
   Prospectors have invaded Yanomami land in the remote western
Amazon state of Roraima, devastating the forest and bringing
disease and death to the Indians.
   After consulting with Lutzenberger and visiting the area, Collor
ordered the dynamiting of clandestine air strips on tribal land and
said the Northern Rim project would be redirected toward protecting
the environment.
   ``We must remove the prospectors, but we also must give them
decent living conditions,'' Lutzenberger said. ``They are not there
because they're bad or want to destroy.''
   Lutzenberger, a descendant of German immigrants, is an
agronomist with a degree from the University of Louisiana. In the
1970s, he resigned as a chemical company executive to join the
ecology movement and helped found Brazil's first environmental
protection group.
   Later, Lutzenberger established an environmental consulting firm.
   He pushed for tougher laws on pesticide control and for
installation of anti-pollution filters at a cellulose plant in his
native Rio Grande do Sul state, in southern Brazil.
   Lutzenberger was among the first to sound the alarm about the
Amazon.
   ``This problem concerns all of humanity,'' he told reporters
shortly after becoming environment secretary.
   ``It concerns the continuation of life on this planet. This
requires not just plans for preservation, protection or parks. It
requires fundamentally rethinking our economic programs.''
   He appealed for help from industrialized countries.
   ``We must establish now an intensive and continuing dialogue
between the governments of the First World and the Third World on
how we can collaborate to save the last jungles,'' Lutzenberger
told the journalists.
   One way, he said, is to write off part of Brazil's $114 billion
foreign debt against programs to preserve the Amazon.
   Brazil has rejected such ``debt for nature'' swaps on grounds
they violate national sovereignty. Of that, Lutzenberger said:
   ``The idea is to find ways to reduce the debt in exchange for
the preservation of Amazonia by our government. There is not the
slightest intention to `internationalize' the Amazon.''
   A key test of his strength is likely to be a proposed highway
from the western Amazon through Peru to the Pacific.
   Lutzenberger opposes the highway, but Peru and governors of
Brazil's Amazonian states say it is vital to economic development
in the region. Most of the governors supported Collor for president.
   ``The important thing to watch is how much power he has. Let's
see what happens when he conflicts with the highway lobby,''
Fearnside, the U.S. researcher, said in a telephone interview from
Manaus, in the Amazon jungle 3,000 miles northwest of Rio.
   Some fear Lutzenberger's well-known temper and firm convictions
could work against him.
   ``If he's very radical, Collor will be pressured to get rid of
him,'' Frisch said.

<HEAD>Scientists Studying Antarctic Ice Cap Holes For Climate Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mysterious holes that periodically form in the
ice covering Antarctic seas may serve as vents for excess heat and
trapped gas, helping to shape the Earth's climate and influencing
the ``greenhouse effect.''
   These ice-free regions, some as large as France, weren't
discovered until 1974 when scientists began examining new satellite
images of Antarctica and the frozen ocean encircling it. Scientists
don't know if the holes called polynyas existed before then or even
how frequently they develop in the vast ice cover.
   Teams of scientists from the Soviet Union, the United States and
West Germany have worked since 1981 to figure out how the holes
form, what role they play in ocean circulation and how they affect
the climate.
   Polynya (pronounced ``pa-lean-yah''') is a Russian word used to
identify an area in an ice field that is persistently free of ice,
said Arnold Gordon, a professor of physical oceanography at Columbia
University in New York.
   Some oceanographers believe the Antarctic polynyas might play a
role in the greenhouse effect that could have dire consequences in
the coming century.
   As the world's largest oceans converge in an area unofficially
named the Southern Ocean they expel heat from the tropical sun and
probably some carbon dioxide from decaying fish and plants into the
atmosphere, oceanographers say.
   ``This Antarctic zone region is very important to the global
climate because this is where the ocean loses heat to the
atmosphere,'' said Gordon, an authority on polynyas. Scientists
believe that during the winter the polynyas act like vents to
eliminate excess heat, and provide outlets for excess carbon dioxide
that could kill marine life.
   Some scientists believe the greenhouse effect is caused by excess
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from tropical deforestation and
burning fossil fuels.
   Polynyas, by venting carbon dioxide, also may be ``acting like
our burning of fossil fuels and putting more CO2 in the atmosphere
and contributing to the greenhouse effect warming of the climate,''
Gordon said.
   ``That's why it's most critical that we know in the future what
causes the polynya, what effect the heat and CO2 flux has on the
greenhouse effect and how might that be changed in the future as the
earth's atmosphere warms up.''
   In a search for those answers, Gordon has visited Antarctica
twice during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. He went in 1981 with
Soviet scientists from the Arctic-Antarctic Research Institute in
Leningrad, and in 1986 with a West German team from the Alfred
Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven.
U.S., Soviet and West German scientists plan this summer to sample
ice and water at varying depths near a large underwater ridge called
Maud Rise.
   Scientists believe this ridge and others in the ocean floor may
help create polynyas by pushing warmer water from the bottom up to
the ice cover, where it melts the ice or prevents it from forming,
Gordon said.
   Polynyas also may develop because of the Antarctic region's role
in global ocean circulation, Gordon and Josefino C. Comiso, a
physical scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, reported in Scientific American.
   ``The exchanges of energy, water and gases between the ocean and
the atmosphere around Antarctica have a major role in determining
the large-scale motion, temperature and chemical composition of the
ocean and atmosphere throughout the globe,'' Gordon and Comiso said
in their June report.
   When the sun warms the oceans in the tropics and sub-tropics,
``the warm water mixes downward by vertical turbulence _ the heat
from the upper layers is carried down by turbulence to the deep
ocean,'' Gordon says. The warm water is drawn to Antartica by a
complex process called wind-induced vertical upwelling: as the wind
blows the upper 300 feet of water northward from Antarctica, it is
replaced by the warmer, deeper water, ``like a giant conveyer belt.''
   Scientists have identified two types of polynyas in the ice
blanket that can cover an area up to twice the size of the
continental United States.
   Coastal polynyas ``are essentially sea-ice factories,'' Gordon
and Comiso wrote. They develop when strong local winds blow ice away
from the shoreline and remain unfrozen as warm water surges up from
the bottom. ``This exposes an area of open ocean on which more ice
can form, continuing the process.''
   Open-ocean polynyas form in the middle of the vast ice cover on
the ocean around Antarctica and could ``have a great effect on the
chemistry and climate of the atmosphere and the deep ocean
worldwide,'' Gordon and Comiso wrote. But they ``occur irregularly
and at this point are unpredictable,'' Gordon said.
   Scientists believe small polynyas _ about 40 square miles _
probably form for several weeks during the Antarctic winter and then
inexplicably disappear, but they've also discovered much larger
holes in the ice.
   ``They are so big that you cannot really think they do not have
any impact at all'' on the Earth's climate, Comiso said in a
telephone interview.
   In 1974, oceanographers found a polynya about the size of France
in the Weddell Sea's ice cover. During the summer, the ice melted,
as it usually does, but in the winter of 1975 the giant polynya
mysteriously reformed in just about the same area. It disappeared
again during the summer and reappeared in 1976. In 1977, it didn't
return. Smaller polynyas have developed for several weeks since then
in the same area, but the mammoth one hasn't returned.
   Another large polynya _ 36,000 square kilometers _ has been
observed since in the Cosmonaut Sea, also in an area of a large
undersea ridge, Gordon said.
   ``The real question,'' he said, ``is what causes these really big
ones, because those are the ones that will have a major impact on
the climate.''

<TEXT>
   Castigating those who make ``cruel''
charges that Brazil is destroying its vast jungle, President Jose
Sarney has announced a $350 million plan to protect its Amazon rain
forest.
   ``Our priority is the conservation of our ecological heritage,''
Sarney said Thursday in announcing a program called ``Our Nature,''
which creates forest preserves and additional Indian reservations
and bans timber exports.
   Sarney criticized the ``alarmist tone of the international
campaign'' and said satellite photos showed only 5 percent of
Brazil's rain forest had been destroyed, compared with estimates of
up to 12 percent.
   Describing the 2 million square miles of rain forest as
``Brazil's sovereign patrimony,'' he said Brazilians are ``accused
of something we cannot accept, of destroying our own territory.''
   Such charges of environmental destruction are ``cruel and unfair
.. . full of scientific falsehoods that misinform the world,''
Sarney said. Politicians, scientists and ambassadors from
neighboring South American countries attended the ceremony at the
presidential palace.
   Ecologists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the
``greenhouse effect,'' a warming trend that is warming the planet
and affecting its weather, but Brazil has rebuffed proposals for
foreign participation in conservation.
   ``Our Nature,'' which also establishes an Environmental Fund,
includes 17 presidential decrees and seven bills to be sent to
Congress.
   Among the measures are:
   _Ending financial incentives for cattle ranching in the Amazon,
seen as the single greatest factor in destruction of the rain
forest. World Bank figures say the 1975-86 investment in ranching
exceeded $1 billion.
   _Government control of mercury, which is used by gold miners in
the Amazon and has become a major source of water pollution. The
government also would rehabilitate areas damaged by mining.
   _Creation of a special forest police force to control fires set
by ranchers and farmers to clear jungle land, to be aided by the
armed forces and satellite photos.
   _Mapping ``agro-ecological zones'' to determine which parts of
the Amazon can be developed without environmental damage, aided by
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
   Sarney said the goal is ``a permanent and economically viable
development program, ecologically adequate, politically balanced
and socially just.''
   Brazil has set aside 124,000 square miles of land in the past
four years for its 220,000 native Indians, he said, and reserving
another 160,000 is under study.
   The president said ``Our Nature'' would cost Brazil $350 million
in the first two years and the government would welcome help from
abroad, ``but we will not accept tutelage,'' he said.
   ``Our doors are open to cooperation from the world, but without
conditions,'' he declared.
   As he has before, Sarney rejected proposals to trade part of
Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt for investment in conservation
projects, which he called ``an attempt to convert ecology into
business.''

BRAZIL TRIES TO RID YANOMAMI INDIAN LANDS OF GOLD PROSPECTORS; 
</P>
<P>
AMAZON: THE INTRUDERS BRING THE THREAT OF DISEASE AND RAVAGE HUNTING GROUNDS.

Delays in government help for Brazil's beleaguered Yanomami Indians have 
permitted thousands of invading gold prospectors to remain on Indian homelands, 
exposing the Yanomamis to disease and ravaging their traditional hunting 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 5, armed prospectors entered a Yanomami village and killed two 
Indians, including a chieftain known as Lourenco. Indians killed two 
prospectors in the clash, which reflected the deadly nature of the struggle 
over Yanomami lands. 
</P>
<P>
Indian rights advocates in Brazil say that since 1987, 1,000 to 2,000 of 
Brazil's 9,000 Yanomamis have died from disease or malnutrition as a result of 
the prospector invasion. Because they are the largest group among the dwindling 
native peoples of the Brazilian Amazon region, the struggle of the Yanomamis 
has drawn international attention. 
</P>
<P>
In January, police acting on a court order began removing about 20,000 
prospectors from the Yanomami lands, which extend along the Venezuelan border 
of Roraima state in far northwestern Brazil. But last week, officials in the 
independent attorney general's office in Brasilia said that between 2,000 and 
3,000 prospectors remain in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds, heavy seasonal rains and political maneuvering are some of the 
reasons given for delays in evicting prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials now say they are preparing a final push that will remove 
all unwelcome outsiders from the area of 36,000 square miles. A health program 
for the Indians is to be carried out at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Most of about $2 million in funding for the project, called Operation Yanomami, 
has been tied up for weeks in bureaucratic red tape at the Economics Ministry. 
The operation is being planned by the National Indian Foundation, a government 
agency known as Funai. 
</P>
<P>
Cantidio Guerreiro Guimaraes, a retired air force sergeant who was appointed 
president of the agency in August, said the money will soon be released and 
that the operation will begin this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the rains to cease for us to (complete) the removal of the 
prospectors," Guimaraes said. "They are going to be removed by helicopter and 
left outside the area." He said equipment used by prospecting groups, including 
airplanes and dredges, will be confiscated if found in the Yanomami area. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Guimaraes said, "We want to finish the operation, leave the 
area free (of prospectors), by the 28th of December." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that it may take 20 years for Yanomami hunting grounds to recover 
from depredation by the prospectors, who have deforested large areas, polluted 
rivers with mercury and torn up river beds in their search for gold. Mining 
activity and environmental damage have severely reduced the availability of 
vital fish and game. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, those areas are going to be of very little use to the Yanomami Indians, 
because they are practically destroyed," Guimaraes said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Carlos Libanio, executive secretary of a liberal lobbying group called 
Nucleus for Indian Rights, said President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took 
office in March, has not taken strong action against the invading prospectors 
for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors and gold traders are powerful interest groups in Roraima state 
politics. According to Libanio, Collor wants them to support his allies in Oct. 
3 elections for state offices and the national Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernardo Cabral, Collor's justice minister, said the president is 
firmly on the side of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"President Collor's objective is to treat Indian reservations as a kind of 
sanctuary," Cabral said. "The Collor government is not going to permit 
prospectors to continue invading Indian territory, carrying diseases into the 
Indian territory."

<HEAD>Fewer Fires in Amazon This Year But Damage Still Extensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of fires set in the
Amazon rain forest has dropped from last year but the region is
still suffering extensive damage, government scientists said
Wednesday.
   They say the burning increases the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect, which causes a
global warming.
   Marcos Pereira, a researcher at the Space Studies Institute, said
experts in the past two months detected 59,000 fires that devastated
12,700 square miles of forest _ an area larger than Maryland.
   That represents roughly 1.5 percent of the so-called legal
Amazon, a 2 million-square-mile region.
   ``We're certainly going to have fewer fires and less destruction
in 1989 than in 1988, primarily because we've had unusually heavy
rains this year,'' Pereira told The Associated Press by telephone
from Sao Jose dos Campos, 210 miles southwest of Rio.
   In 1988, about 45,600 square miles were destroyed by 205,000
fires, Pereira said.
   The institute monitors fires in the Amazon by using satellites
that detect smoke and heat.
   Pereira said the government helped reduce the number of fires,
mainly by suspending incentives for large-scale agricultural and
ranching projects.
   It also began a plan this month to monitor part of the region by
helicopter and fine those found guilty of clearing the forest
illegally.
   Officials handed out $9 million in fines in the first 15 days.
   ``There's a greater awareness of the problem, on the part of the
government and individuals, and that will make it easier to protect
the Amazon,'' Pereira said.
   Ranchers and farmers burn off large tracts of the rain forest to
clear land for planting and grazing.

<HEAD>New Amazon Nature Reserve Expected To Draw `Ecotourists'</HEAD>

   An Amazonian nature reserve the size of
Connecticut could become an important tourist attraction, helping
to show Third World countries they can make more money saving
forests than logging them, conservationists say.
   The Tambo Pata-Candamo Reserve in a remote, nearly uninhabited
Amazon valley has among the highest numbers of rare and exotic
birds and animals of any area in the world, said Charles Munn, an
ornithologist with Wildlife Conservation International in New York.
   Set aside as a reserve, the park could help promote
``ecotourism'' as a means for Third World nations to profit from
their wilderness areas without destroying them, Munn said.
   Before being declared a park Feb. 17, the area covered by the
3.7-million-acre reserve had been drawing about 9,000 tourists a
year, generating $2 million annually for Peru.
   ``This area can be self-sustaining immediately if they enact a
gate fee of even $5 a day per visitor,'' Munn said. ``This is
unusual. It could simply live off of gate receipts.''
   About one out of every eight species of birds in the world is
found in Tambo Pata, Munn said in an interview Tuesday.
   ``In three square miles of southeastern Peru, you can see 560
species, which is a world record,'' he said. ``You can see 330 in
one day. Which is not bad.''
   All of Canada and the United States have only about 830 species.
   Among the Peruvian birds are eight species of brightly colored
macaws, the world's largest and most endangered parrots. They
congregate in great wildlife spectacles around ``macaw licks,''
where they eat clay to help digest their food.
   The reserve is also home to the endangered, 6-foot-long giant
otter, which travels in family packs and eats anacondas, among
other delicacies. The park has ``white-water rafting that will
knock your socks off,'' Munn said.
   Peru announced last month the establishment of a 1-million-acre
reserve, Kugapakori-Nahua Indian Reserve, to protect the Kugapakori
and Nahua Indians, who remain out of contact with civilization,
Munn said.
   ``If you go in there, they kill you,'' said Munn. ``So you don't
go in there.''
   The two new reserves are near the Manu Biosphere Reserve, an
even larger park roughly the size of Massachusetts.
   This area of Peru is not among those affected by guerrilla and
cocaine trafficking violence, Munn said. ``I take my family down
with me, including two young children,'' he said.
   ``Peru has a fantastic system of parks and reserves on paper,''
said Adrian Forsyth, a tropical ecologist with Conservation
International in Washington, D.C. ``If they can just get the
support needed to have them operate, I think conservation in Peru
will be in pretty good shape.''
   The Tambo Pata-Candamo Reserve, located north of the city of
Puerto Maldonado, about 500 miles southeast of Lima, covers a
varied landscape in the Andes foothills ranging from lowland
tropical rain forest to mist-shrouded cloud forest at elevations up
to 10,000 feet.
   Besides its spectacular bird population, it contains half again
as many trees as any other region in the Amazon, Munn said. And it
is virtually untouched.
   ``The important thing here is there are basically no people
living in this entire area,'' said Munn. ``It is the last big
valley in entire western Amazon that has no people living in it.''
   Peru is also considering setting aside several million
additional acres of rubber and brazil-nut forest in the area
adjacent to the part of Brazil where Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, an
environmental activist and rubber tapper, was murdered in December
1988, Munn said.

   Peter Allen opened the second act of ``Legs
Diamond'' by rising from a coffin and declaring, ``Not even critics
can kill me,'' but his musical was on its last legs.
   The curtain closed on the final performance of the $5.3 million
Broadway bomb Sunday, less than two months after the show about a
big-time New York mobster opened.
   ``Legs'' opened at the end of December to dismal reviews after an
unusually long run of 72 preview performances. There were 64 regular
performances.
   The last show drew two standing ovations: one at the end and one
for the death-defying stunt by Allen, who also wrote the music and
lyrics. The book was by Harvey Fierstein and Charles Suppon.
   The historic Mark Hellinger Theater will close and be turned over
to the Times Square Church, which has rented the building for five
years at $1 million a year, according to the Nederlander theater
organization, which helped produce the show.

   British rock star Sting, meeting with
President Jose Sarney, proposed a worldwide campaign to raise funds
to save the Amazon jungle and create a massive Indian reservation.
   ``We would like to help Brazil create South America's largest
Indian reservation, and I am sure we could make lots of money in the
United States, Japan and Europe for this project,'' Sting told
journalists outside the presidential palace after his two-hour
meeting with Sarney on Sunday.
   ``We need the permission of the Brazilian people for this,'' the
singer-songwriter said. ``We want to help Brazil save the Amazon.''
The Brazilian government has made it clear it won't accept what it
sees as recent foreign meddling in Amazon affairs.
   Sting said he would travel to France, Italy, West Germany, Spain,
England, the United States, Japan and China to raise funds for the
proposed 129,000-square-mile reservation and other Amazonian
ecological projects.
   Sting is in Brazil for a weeklong meeting with Indians from 28
Brazilian tribes and international ecologists, who fear that
destruction of the world's largest tropical rain forest could
contribute to global warming through the greenhouse effect.

   Former Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox has
agreed to advise Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on ethics issues, but
declined to head the state's ethics panel because of time
constraints.
   ``I have had some discussions with the governor's office about
some ethical questions _ long-range, looking-ahead stuff,'' Cox said.
   Cox, 77, is said to be reviewing disclosure requirements for
those seeking state and local approval for development projects and
rules governing outside income for public employees.
   However, the Harvard Law School professor and chairman of the
citizens group Common Cause said he turned down the top post at the
State Ethics Commission.
   Cox is best known as the special prosecutor in the Watergate
scandal who was fired in the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in 1973.

   Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife,
Yelena Bonner, are visiting relatives in the Boston area for the
first time together.
   The couple declined to comment when they arrived at Logan
International Airport on Saturday, with Bonner saying they wanted
``private time.''
   The Sakharovs came here to visit their grandchildren in suburban
Newton before returning to Moscow, said Efrem Yankelevich, who is
married to Bonner's daughter, Tatiana.
   ``As far as I know he does not intend to make any public
appearances. He will be here I don't know how long but probably just
for a few days, and then he goes back to Moscow,'' Yankelevich said.
   The couple had been in Canada for a week. Sakharov received a
$20,000 humanitarian award Friday from the St. Boniface Hospital
Research Foundation in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities, visited the United States for four weeks last fall on
his first visit to the West. Bonner did not accompany her husband
then but has made previous visits alone to the United States.

   Bobby Hull returned to the city he put
on the hockey map as the Winnipeg Jets retired his number a decade
after he left the team.
   ``I don't know how you expect me to talk after that,'' a
choked-up Hull said Sunday night after receiving a series of
tributes and gifts, including a Jets' No. 9 jersey presented by team
captain Dale Hawerchuk.
   ``I was 50 years old in January,'' Hull said. ``I've played in
Stanley Cup-final seventh games, represented my country _ but I've
never had this kind of feeling before.
   ``I've never cried before, either.''
   The star left winger with the 100 mph slap shot, nicknamed the
Golden Jet, stunned the hockey world in 1972 by accepting a
$2.75-million deal to jump to Winnipeg from the National Hockey
League's Chicago Blackhawks.
   Among those honoring Hull before the Jets' game against the
Hartford Whalers was Gordie Howe, the NHL's all-time scoring leader,
who was a teammate of Hull's in Hartford in 1980.
   ``The strength of the man, the beautiful stride ... his
particular style captured the imagination of everybody,'' said Howe,
the only other player to have his number retired by two teams.
Howe's sweaters hang in Hartford and Detroit, and Hull's number also
has been retired in Chicago.

   Global crop watchers say there are some
disturbing similarities in some of the major breadbasket areas of
the United States and Soviet Union.
   The government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said
Tuesday that dry soil conditions and lack of snow cover in parts of
the Great Plains continue to threaten the winter wheat crop.
   The same goes for parts of the Soviet winter wheat area.
   ``Portions of the southern Great Plains received some moisture
but more was needed,'' the report said. ``Most of the central and
northern Great Plains remained dry, but above normal temperatures
helped to maintain crop condition.''
   In its international section, the report said January brought
above normal precipitation in the Baltic states, Belorussia,
Central Region, Volga Vyatsk, western Black Soils Region, the
eastern Ukraine and parts of the North Caucasus.
   ``In contrast, there was below normal precipitation in the
western and southern Ukraine, the eastern Black Soils region and
the Volga,'' the report said. ``Unusually mild weather covered the
entire region during most of January.''
   Although the warm weather ``provided generally favorable
conditions for winter grain,'' it left crop areas over a wide
expanse of the Soviet Union ``without a protective snow cover and
caused winter grains to lose hardiness, making them more
susceptible to potential winterkill.''
   In assessing the U.S. situation, the report noted ``lack of snow
cover has left the (winter wheat) crop vulnerable to freeze
damage.''
   The facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and
commerce. The weekly reports cover soil and crop conditions but do
not project yields.
   Looking at some other crops, the report said the sugarcane
harvest continued in Florida, but ``unseasonably hot, dry weather
forced citrus producers to continue irrigating.''
   The warm weather also continued over the major Florida vegetable
areas where spring plantings were under way.
   In Georgia, tobacco plant beds were reported in ``good to
excellent'' condition and that North Carolina farmers continued to
seed their beds.
   ``Rain and wet field conditions again limited field work in the
Delta,'' the report said. ``Land preparation for the 1990 cotton
crop continued in Arizona and California.''
   Livestock pastures were helped by rain and mild temperatures in
the Delta and Southeast, the report said.
   ``In the Great Plains and Corn Belt, mild temperatures and the
lack of snow cover reduced the amount of supplemental feeding
necessary (for livestock),'' the report said. ``Mild weather
provided ideal conditions for calving, which was under way in many
areas.''

   China and the United States lead the world in
grain production, but their mix of crops is significantly
different, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Total U.S. grain output in the 1989-90 season is estimated at
281.8 million metric tons, second only to China's 307.6 million
tons, according to the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equivalent to 36.7
bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   China's wheat production of 91 million tons leads the world,
edging the Soviet Union's 90.5 million tons, while U.S. output was
55.4 million tons. India was close behind the United States with 54
million tons.
   It is in the category of ``coarse grains,'' however, that U.S.
muscle pulls ahead. Those include corn, oats, barley, sorghum and
rye. Total U.S. production was 221.4 million tons, more than double
the Soviet Union's 107 million tons, which ranked second.
   China's coarse grain output was 91.3 million tons. But China led
in rice, with 125.3 million tons, milled equivalent, against 4.9
million tons for the United States and 1.8 million for the Soviet
Union.

   Italians are hooked on American walnuts, even
as their own production rises, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   ``Although Italy produces walnuts, they are a smaller variety
than the large California variety the United States exports,'' the
report said. ``An increase in Italy's production this year is not
expected to affect the import level, since consumers prefer the
larger-sized imports.''
   The United States provides about 92 percent of the walnuts
imported by Italy, said the report, which was written by Frank J.
Piason, U.S. agricultural counselor in Rome.
   Walnuts are eaten by Italians at the end of meals, particularly
during the Christmas season, and are ``increasingly consumed as a
snack food and used in confectionery products,'' he said.

In the rain forest of the western Amazon, the threat of violent death hangs in 
the air like mist after a tropical rain. It is simply a part of the ecosystem, 
just like the scorpions and snakes cached in the leafy canopy that floats over 
the forest floor like a seamless green circus tent. 
</P>
<P>
People from the Amazon say that the trouble always starts during the burning 
season, a period of two months or so between the two natural climatic seasons 
of the region -- the dry and the wet. By then, the equatorial sun has baked the 
last moisture out of the brush, grass and felled trees, and the people of the 
Amazon -- sometimes Indians and rubber tappers, but most often wealthy ranchers 
and small farmers -- set their world on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The fires clear the clogged fields or freshly deforested land and, in 
disintegrating vegetation, put a few of the nutrients essential for plant 
growth back in the impoverished soil. The burning season is the time before the 
return of the daily downpours that give the rain forest its name. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble arises when one man's fires threaten another man's livelihood. Most 
often, that happens when one of the hundreds of ranchers or speculators who 
have been drawn to the region's cheap land acquires the title to property that 
already is the home of people who have squatted there legally -- sometimes for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Often the new titles are acquired through fraud or coercion. And because the 
most efficient way to reinforce a claim to land in the Amazon is to cut down 
the forest and burn it, the new landlords do just that. Or they loose their 
cattle, which make quick work of the settlers' crops. If that does not work, 
they send out their pistoleiros to burn the families out of their shacks or, if 
they resist, shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that has prevented the Amazon river basin and its peoples from 
being totally overrun is its sheer size and daunting character. It is a shallow 
bowl covering 3.6 million square miles, twice the expanse of India. An average 
of eight feet of rain falls here each year, inundating great stretches of 
forest, turning roads into bogs, and providing vast breeding grounds for 
malaria mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
The water drains eastward through a fanlike network of streams and rivers that 
together disgorge 170 billion gallons of water each hour into the Atlantic -- 
eleven times the flow of the Mississippi. Besides producing this riverine sea, 
the deluge also nourishes the largest stretch of rain forest left on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tens of thousands of plant species in the forest is a tree with a 
smooth trunk that produces a white fluid in a reticulation of tubules beneath 
its bark. Its local name is seringueira; botanists call it Hevea brasiliensis. 
Its common name is the rubber tree. The fluid is thought to protect the tree 
from invasions of boring pests by gumming up the insects' mouth parts. 
</P>
<P>
This same fluid, congealed and properly processed, has remarkable qualities of 
resilience, water resistance and insulation to the flow of electricity -- all 
of which made it one of the most sought after raw materials of the Industrial 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
It was this substance, called latex, that lured the grandfather of Chico Mendes 
and tens of thousands of other men to the Amazon rain forest in two waves over 
the past 120 years. Called seringueiros, these men settled in the forests 
around ports like Xapuri and worked in solitude, fighting to make a life from 
the living forest -- and fighting to free themselves from bosses who saw to it 
that they remained enslaved by their debts. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, as outsiders intent on destroying the forest began to invade the 
Amazon, the seringueiros had to fight once again. This time, they were fighting 
to save their homes, their livelihood and the rain forest around them. 
</P>
<P>
In leading this struggle to preserve the Amazon, Chico Mendes had made a lot of 
trouble for a lot of powerful people. He was to the ranchers of the Amazon what 
Cesar Chavez was to the citrus kings of California, what Lech Walesa was to the 
shipyard managers of Gdansk. The Xapuri Rural Workers Union, which Mendes 
helped found in 1977, regularly sent swarms of demonstrators to thwart the 
ranchers' chain-saw crews. 
</P>
<P>
With his aggressive tactics and fable, plain-talking style, Mendes had then 
attracted the attention of American environmentalists, who invited him to 
Washington and Miami to help them convince the international development banks 
to suspend loans that were allowing Brazil to pave the roads leading into the 
Amazon. Mendes made friends abroad, but he made more enemies at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Amazon was one of the last places where might still made right. In that 
sense, it differed little from the American West of the 19th Century as 
described in 1872 by Mark Twain in "Roughing It": "The very paradise of outlaws 
and desperadoes." 
</P>
<P>
In the Amazon, when you ask people about justica (justice), they simply chuckle 
in a sad kind of way; most of the men in the prison cells are sleeping off a 
drunk, having had several too many slugs of the blazing, strong sugar-cane rum 
called cachaca, which is sold for pennies a glass. In fact, more than 1,000 
people have been murdered in land disputes in rural Brazil since 1980, and 
Amnesty International estimates that fewer than 10 of the killers have been 
convicted and sent to jail. And not one mandante (mastermind) of a murder has 
ever been tried. 
</P>
<P>
In this anarchic atmosphere, the pistoleiros often assume the look of their 
imagined Wild West predecessors, strutting through town with a revolver stuck 
in the waist of tight jeans, boot heels raising red dust. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was that in the latter half of December, the threats against Mendes had 
been replaced with death pronouncements. "Threat" implies that death is only a 
possibility; in Mendes' case, imminent death was a near inevitability. He was 
shot at close range with a .20 gauge shotgun when he stepped out his backdoor. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral of Mendes was held on Christmas Day. Through what the tappers call 
radio cipo -- vine radio, the rain forest version of the grapevine -- word of 
the murder spread quickly. Hundreds of rubber tappers hiked for many hours 
through the forest to attend the wake and funeral. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas morning, more than a thousand people had crowded around the 
church. The rains had returned in force, drenching the mourners who followed 
the casket to the cemetery on the road leading out of town. Along with the 
hundreds of rubber tappers and small farmers in the procession were dozens of 
Mendes's friends from the other Brazil -- celebrities, politicians and labor 
leaders. Surrounding the crowd were dozens of journalists, many from overseas. 
An international version of vine radio had efficiently disseminated the news of 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of Mendes might well have been an unremarkable event. He was the 
fifth rural union president murdered in Brazil that year, But over the previous 
three years, Mendes' closer relationships with environmentalists, labor 
organizers, and human-rights advocates from Brazil, the United States and 
Europe had focused increased attention on the struggle of the rubber tappers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this murder deep in the Amazon rain forest -- where it once took 
three weeks for news to travel down the river -- instantly became an 
international story, making the front page of newspapers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of his murder was further amplified by the disturbing 
environmental anomalies of 1988. The scorching summer in the United States that 
year had motivated politicians and the media for the first time to pay serious 
attention to the greenhouse effect, the theory that billions of tons of gases 
released each year by the burning of fossil fuels and forests are trapping 
solar energy in the atmosphere and disastrously warming the planet. 
</P>
<P>
And just as the heat was breaking records and fires were ravaging Yellowstone 
National Park, the television networks got detailed satellite photographs of 
the Amazon burning season -- thousands of fires burning simultaneously. It 
almost felt as if the heat and smoke generated in the forests were being 
inhaled on the baking streets of Los Angeles, Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the slaying of Mendes. In the months that followed, dozens of 
television crews, photographers and reporters from around the world would take 
the six-hour, four-stop flight from Sao Paulo to Rio Branco, the capital of the 
state of Acre, then bounce for four more hours along the rutted, dusty, partly 
paved road to Xapuri, the river town where Mendes lived. Visitors who stayed 
long enough to walk for a time in the surrounding forest discovered the bounty 
of the ecosystem that Mendes had died defending. It was a place of spectacular 
diversity and vitality. Turn over a log and find 50 species of beetle. Survey 
an acre and find 100 species of butterfly. In the Amazon, one type of rubber 
tree has exploding fruit that flings seeds 20 yards; three-toed sloths harbor 
dozens of species of insects and algae in their matted fur; river porpoises are 
cotton-candy pink. 
</P>
<P>
It was a living pharmacy that scientists had only just begun to explore. A 
fourth of all prescription drugs contain ingredients derived from tropical 
plants -- malaria drugs and anesthetics and antibiotics and more -- and less 
than 1% of the Amazon's plants had been studied. 
</P>
<P>
It became clear to outsiders that the murder was a microcosm of the larger 
crime: the unbridled destruction of the last great reservoir of biological 
diversity on Earth. Just a few centuries ago, the planet had 15 million square 
miles of rain forest, an area five times that of the contiguous United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now three Americas' worth of forest were gone, with just 6.2 million square 
miles left. One-third of the remaining rain forest was in the Amazon basin, and 
over the past decade alone, chain saws and fires had consumed about 10% of it, 
an area twice the size of California. 
</P>
<P>
The aggression against the forest was therefore a many-layered tragedy, causing 
human deaths, killing millions of trees and other organisms and resulting in 
the extinction of several species of plant and animal life each day -- most of 
which had not even been noticed, let alone catalogued or studied. In some ways, 
Mendes and the rubber tappers were simply another endangered species, as much a 
part of the ecosystem as the trees they tapped, the birds in the branches, or 
the ants underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
But the tappers were a species that was fighting back.

<HEAD>Wildlife Experts Draft Conservation Blueprint For the 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask Russ Mittermeier about his work, and he'll
talk about marketing, the hard sell, tough choices and money _ just
what you might expect from a sales executive or investment
counselor.
   Mittermeier, however, is a wildlife biologist and vice president
for science of the World Wildlife Fund. He's talking about
marketing conservation in countries where people struggle to find
their next meal. He's deciding how to get the most from a limited
pool of conservation dollars.
   His approach is a sign of a new discipline among
conservationists as they try to sharpen the conservation blueprint
for the 1990s.
   ``I think we've got the potential to find the resources to make
conservation work,'' he said. ``We really have to make good
conservation an element of good development.''
   Other conservationists are thinking along similar lines. In
January, the World Resources Institute issued a report titled,
``The Crucial Decade: The 1990s and The Global Environmental
Challenge.''
   ``If efforts to save species and biological diversity are to
succeed, a more coordinated, systematic and aggressive
international effort is needed,'' the report said. ``The 1990s will
be the crucial decade for action on these pressing concerns.''
   Without a major effort, it said, ``irreparable damage will be
done to the world's environment, and the problems will prove
increasingly intractable, expensive and dominated by crises.''
   Mittermeier is trying to save endangered animals. Saving animals
means saving habitat. The most carefully protected animals cannot
survive if they have no place to live.
   So much has been said about the loss of habitat that the mere
recitation of statistics has lost its force. Each year, about
42,000 square miles of tropical forest are lost _ almost enough to
cover the state of New York.
   It's anybody's guess how many plant and animal species are
disappearing.
   In a report titled ``Biodiversity,'' Harvard biologist E.O.
Wilson tweaked the numbers and came up with this: Species are being
lost 1,000 to 10,000 times as fast as they were before human beings
arrived on the scene.
   ``By the turn of the century, much of the remaining tropical
forest is going to be in isolated parks surrounded by
development,'' said Mittermeier. ``There will be very few places
where natural evolutionary processes continue, where traditional
people continue to live traditional lifestyles.''
   Mittermeier and his colleagues have established three lines of
attack to try to limit the damage:
   _They've identified 10 ``threatened hot spots,'' small forested
regions in immediate danger. The hot spots cover two-tenths of 1
percent of the Earth's surface but harbor 27 percent of all
tropical forest plant species.
   _They've targeted 13 countries as ``megadiversity countries,''
for their unusually rich animal and plant life. These countries
contain at least 60 percent of the world's plant and animal species.
   _And they've identified what they call major wilderness areas,
the few places still mostly undisturbed where, if steps are taken
soon, evolution can continue and traditional people can survive.
   The ``threatened hot spots'' idea came from Norman Myers, a
senior fellow at the World Wildlife Fund.
   Without emergency aid, the 10 ``hot spots'' are likely to lose
90 percent of their forest cover within the next decade. That would
mean losing almost 7 percent of the Earth's 5 million to 30 million
plant and animal species.
   Apart from Madagascar and New Caledonia, the threatened hot
spots are in South American and Asia. South America's are in the
Choco region of Colombia, western Ecuador, the uplands of western
Amazonia and the Atlantic coast of Brazil.
   Asia's are in the Philippines, northern Borneo, Malaysia and the
eastern Himalayas.
   Many of the species in these areas have already been lost or
will soon be lost, even if the areas are left untouched from now
on, Myers said. The rule of thumb is that for half of the species
to survive, the remaining forest must cover at least 10 percent of
its original range.
   Myers says that is hardly ever the case.
   Mittermeier developed the concept of megadiversity countries.
``As a marketing device, it's tremendously valuable,'' he said. It
can be used in the megadiversity countries to excite the public
about conservation.
   ``It's a source of national pride,'' he said. ``It tells them,
in terms of natural resources, `we're pretty special.' It's an
effective way of selling conservation to them _ and to
foundations.''
   Because these countries contain at least 60 percent and perhaps
even 80 percent of the world's species, they ought to get 60
percent or 70 percent of conservation funds, Mittermeier has
proposed.
   The countries are Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Brazil, Zaire, Madagascar, Indonesia, Australia, India, China and
Malaysia.
   Mittermeier, whose research specialty is primates, said Brazil,
Zaire, Indonesia and Madagascar contain two-thirds of the world's
primate species. ``If we aren't successful in saving primate
species in these countries, we're going to lose a major portion of
the species,'' he said.
   ``We're not writing off the rest of the world. We're saying do
something in every country on Earth. But strategically, when we do
our planning, these countries should get a major chunk of the
interest, a major chunk of the investment.''
   There is some good news in this story: Mittermeier and company
have identified five major wilderness areas that have a good chance
of survival.
   ``These areas are not under immediate threat,'' he said. It
won't require a large investment to save them. ``You just have to
point out to the countries that this is something you should invest
in for the future,'' he said.
   They are in New Guinea, central Zaire, Venezuela south of the
Orinoco River, parts of upper Amazonia, and in a region that cuts
across southern Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana.
   The other bit of good news is that the World Bank, where
Mittermeier has served as manager of a task force on biodiversity,
takes conservation seriously.
   The bank's mission traditionally has been to foster development
in poor countries, which often put it in conflict with
environmentalists. It made an important change in 1986 with the
adoption of a wildlands policy.
   ``Wildlands can often contribute significantly to economic
development,'' the bank said. ``The Bank's policy is therefore to
seek a balance between preserving the environmental values of the
world's more important remaining wildlands and converting some of
them to more intensive, shorter term use.''
   Mittermeier said conservationists should do two things to try to
save remaining forests. The first is to expand the number and size
of protected areas. But that has its limitations.
   ``They are expensive and will compose, at best, only five to 10
percent of the world's land area,'' Mittermeier said.
   The second tactic is to encourage profitable use of the forests
that doesn't destroy them. Researchers recently found, for example,
that harvesting latex, fruit and wood from a managed forest was
three times as profitable as cutting it down to produce pulpwood or
raise crops or cattle, Mittermeier said.
   ``Development inevitably comes back to depending on natural
resources,'' he said, ``and if you don't use natural resources
wisely, your development efforts and your global economy are
eventually going to go down the tube.''

<HEAD>Lack Of Resources Hampers Drug War In Bolivia</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHIMORE, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trucks and jeeps stand idle for lack of
fuel. Specially trained Bolivian police complain of too little food.
   It hasn't been a good week at this key base of operations for the
national war on drug trafficking.
   Indeed, U.S. and Bolivian officials say that despite improved
cooperation between their countries, the battle is being lost
because troops don't get enough logistic and economic support.
   ``Our biggest problem is the lack of resources,'' said Travis
Kuykendall, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's attache in
Bolivia.
   ``If Congress does not send checks to back us, they should send
us home,'' he said in an interview.
   U.S. aid for drug interdiction in Bolivia was cut from $15
million in 1988 to $10 million.
   ``We are doing everything we can to fight the cocaine trade, but
we are fighting a losing war if consumer nations do not increase
their support,'' Information Minister Herman Antelo told The
Associated Press.
   An elite U.S.-trained anti-drug police squad of 200 men, known as
the Leopards, and about 30 U.S. Drug Enforcement and Border Patrol
agents are based in Chimore, a tropical town in the heart of the
Chapare. It's a region east of Cochabamba city known for its
cultivation of coca, the plant whose dried leaves are the source of
cocaine.
   From Chimore, the men stage raids on cocaine paste processing
pits that lie hidden under the jungle canopy.
   During a weekend visit, however, police said they halted
operations because they did not have fuel for the vehicles or enough
food for the Bolivian forces.
   The United States has donated eight rebuilt Huey helicopters to
cover an area the size of Texas. Five were operational during the
weekend, but were being deployed in another region of the country,
the Beni plains.
   So coca leaf buying and selling was brisk along the main Chapare
highway.
   On better weeks, Bolivian police helped by the American agents
raid hundreds of crude cocaine processing pits.
   But the increased police presence has led many processors to set
up camp outside range of the base's ground vehicles and even
choppers, according to Drug Enforcement agents who asked not to be
identified.
   Gov. Bob Martinez of Flordia visited the Chapare region Tuesday
under tight security because of reports an assassination squad of
Colombian drug dealers was in the area.
   ``We had some information that was not confirmed that there was a
Colombian hit team in the area,'' said U.S. Drug Enforcement agent
Gene Castillo. He accompanied Martinez, who arrived in Bolivia
Monday, and U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard on their tour of the
district. A dozen DEA agents and Bolivian police provided security
for the group.
   Martinez, commenting on the importance of the coca plant to the
area farmers, said, ``We can't win the war here, we are going to
have to win it in the U.S.''
   Authorities of both countries say cooperation has increased, and
they are confiscating more chemicals used to process cocaine.
According to the State Department, last year they seized 5,549
gallons of ether, 11,158 gallons of sulfuric acid, 927 tons of lime,
10,304 gallons of acetone and 1.5 million gallons of gasoline and
diesel fuel.
   ``Our main purpose in the Chapare is to stop the ability to get
precursor chemicals in and cocaine paste out,'' Kuykendall said.
``Then they can't sell paste and farmers will not have a market for
their leaves.''
   Raids on pits where the leaf is mashed and mixed with chemicals
are on the rise. Last year 3,542 pits were raided, compared with
1,112 in 1987, according to the State Department. Also last year,
authorities raided 24 laboratories where the paste is converted into
hydrochloric cocaine, the refined powder sniffed by drug users. In
1987, just eight were raided, the records show.
   But, in almost all cases, the processors manage to flee before
the raids. And the number of pits raided is believed to represent
only a small portion of Bolivia's cocaine industry, whose annual
profits are estimated at $300 million. Little if any real decline in
trafficking has been noted.
   According to U.S. officials, neither Bolivia nor the U.S.
government has a single plane capable of intercepting drug flights
out of the country. Large areas bordering Argentina, Peru and Brazil
have no police presence and drugs also move freely on the rivers.
   The United States bought eight powerful motorboats, and a crew
last week confiscated 950 pounds of cocaine paste on one river. But
they had to stop because they, too, ran out of fuel.

<TEXT>
   For 500 years, Brazil's northeast has
been potentially rich and chronically poor.
   Today, as Brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation,
the Northeast holds it back _ not wholly of its own accord.
   The nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles of
land where Brazil bulges out into the Atlantic. In the area, 2{
times the size of Texas, live 45 million of the nation's 143
million people.
   But while the prosperous South, with its airplane and computer
factories, has made Brazil the world's eighth-largest economy, the
northeast remains poor, neglected, diseased and assailed by
devastating cyclical droughts.
   Statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast:
   _ Infant mortality is higher than in sub-Saharan Africa at 124
deaths per 1,000 births, compared to 67 per 1,000 in the South.
   _ Life expectancy is 51 years, compared with 67 in the South.
   _ A full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their own
names; 26 percent can't elsewhere in Brazil.
   _ Diseases long-eradicated elsewhere _ leprosy, chagas disease,
polio, tuberculosis, even the plague _ still kill and deform in the
northeast.
   ``We're creating a race of undersized subhumans who think only
of survival,'' said Carlos Hollanda Labor, health secretary for the
northeast's Ceara state.
   In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy recognized the
parched region, considered one of the world's poorest, as a
possible source of social unrest. Shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution in Cuba, Kennedy launched the U.S. Alliance for
Progress, which promised billions of dollars and poured millions
into development of Brazil's northeast _ until a 1964 Brazilian
right-wing military coup eased fears of a communist or left-wing
uprising.
   Droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape even
before Portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400
years ago.
   A drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated
250,000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slums
in search of food, water and jobs.
   This year, an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide a
respite for the characteristically small-statured northeasterners,
but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive.
   ``The essential problem here is not whether it rains or not,''
said Ari Guimaraes, head of the political science department of the
University of Bahia, another northeastern state. ``The problem is
that the government hasn't built reservoirs, explored underground
water supplies, irrigated peasant properties or distributed land
among those who have no means to survive.''
   From the 1500s well into the 19th century, the northeast was a
productive area, but the wealth stayed with a few.
   Agriculture led the economic activity, and the vast open spaces
lent themselves to production of Brazil's most precious commodities
at the time: cattle, cotton, sugar, tobacco and much later, coffee.
   The Portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land to
nobles and deserving soldiers. But far from central government
control in the South, northeast landowners set ``wild-west'' laws
for peasant ``subjects'' and used private armies to chase
individual farmers from modest-sized lands.
   Such scenes have been pointedly described by Brazil's leading
novelist, Jorge Amado, in ``Gabriela Clove and Cinnamon,''
``Bahia'' and most recently ``Showdown.''
   Successive governments have made promises to wrench the inland
population from medieval-like poverty, but gun battles over land
and vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common.
   The military government that governed from 1964 through 1985
built dams for hydroelectric power, roads, soccer stadiums and
stretched electricty lines across the dry, cracked land. One tough
military president, the late Gen. Emilio Medici, who is said to
have condoned the torture of political opponents, was on the verge
of tears when he saw the northeast's poverty first hand.
   But the grandiose projects of the military government did little
to ease the average northeasterner's lack of food, jobs, water and
land.
   A common belief among Northesterns is that the few direct
investments in their social concerns, such as food and water
distributions during droughts and emergency work-relief jobs, were
turned to political advantage by local land-owning politicians who
pass along favors to those who vote for them.
   ``It is in the interests of the landowners to maintain the
region in utter poverty,'' claimed Maria Luiza Fontenelle, mayor of
Fortaleza, capital of Ceara and the northeast's largest city, with
a population of 1.6 million.
   ``When people are poor they depend upon favors to survive.''
   According to Bishop Jose Rodrigues of the Roman Catholic Church
in the hinterlands of Bahia, mayors control local unions and decide
who gets access to government health care, jobs and other benefits.
   When the military stepped down and civilian government returned
to Brazil in 1985, hopes for widespread social reforms ran high.
But many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been a
hollow triumph.
   Last year, the region sold $4.4 billion worth of fruit, nuts,
cocoa, sugar, tobacco and petroleum to southern Brazil and foreign
countries but received only $1 billion in government investments.
   Promises of a land reform, irrigation of 2.5 million acres of
land and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of President
Jose Sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit, control
runaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meet
payments on a $121 billion foreign debt.
   Most significantly, Brazil's proposed new constitution makes
virtually impossible a long-promised land reform to distribute the
46 percent of rural properties owned by just 1.2 percent of the
population. The Catholic church has accused the government of
bowing to powerful landowners on the issue.
   But political scientists say the northeast's problems are fast
becoming problems for the rest of the country, most particularly
the more affluent South.
   northeasterners, for example, now occupied whole shanty towns in
the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, pressing already
precarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates.
   ``Brazil will never be a stable democracy ... nor a developed
country without resolving its vast inequalities,'' said one
political scientist, Helio Jaguaribe.
   But the political balance also may be shifting.
   In the 1986 gubernatorial elections, northeasterners chose four
governors who are considered politically progressive and more
likely to contest landowner power.
   Mayor Fontenelle of Fortaleza, for example, is a member of the
Radical Worker's Party.
   At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church presses on its own
for change.
   Bishop Rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11
doceses take control of local labor unions, often resulting in gun
and stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors and
local farmers.
   In Jucas, a town of 8,000 people 300 miles west of Fortaleza,
the Rev. Hans Stecker, a German priest who arrived 28 years ago,
wages a relentless battle with Mayor Jose Fagundes, also the town's
largest landowner.
   The priest has built a hospital, 39 schools and pre-schools and
started health and education programs. Stecker said that in
response to his projects the three-term mayor cut church's
telephone lines and prohibited the teaching of religion in town
schools.
   ``In some towns,'' said political scientist Guimaraes, ``the
local priest can't leave home without a gun.''

<HEAD>Supercomputer Foresees End of Amazon Rain Forest in 50-100 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study by the Brazilian Space
Research Institute shows the entire Amazon rain forest could be
wiped out in 50 to 100 years if deforestation continues at the
present rate.
   Carlos Nobre, an engineer and meteorologist with the institute,
said Wednesday the findings were the result of a year-long study at
the University of Maryland using a supercomputer belonging to NASA.
   Nobre said he used mathematical formulas to project the effects
of deforestation, which he estimates destroys 14,000 square miles
of rain forest a year.
   The computer predicted the huge wilderness could dry up and turn
into a vast, scrub-covered savanna, he said.
   ``The advance of pasture land would profoundly change the
landscape and the way of life in the region,'' the scientist said
at the institute in Sao Jose dos Campos, 200 miles southwest of Rio.
   Nobre said the destruction of trees to clear land for planting
and grazing reduces the forest's capacity to retain water.
   As a result, temperatures will rise, rainfall will diminish and
the soil will become poorer, he said. Even the water level in
rivers will fall, reducing the hydroelectric potential.
   When that happens, Nobre said, the rain forest would succumb to
a long dry season and turn into a savanna, covered with scrub trees
and grass.
   The 2 million-square-mile Brazilian Amazon is the world's
largest wilderness. Independent studies show 12 percent of it has
been destroyed, mostly by small farmers and cattle ranchers using
slash-and-burn techniques. The government claims the correct figure
is 5 percent.
   Scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the
greenhouse effect, which traps the sun's rays and causes global
warming.
   The Brazilian government, under fire from environmentalists,
recently announced that burnings in the Amazon were far less than
in previous years.

   For 500 years, Brazil's northeast has
been potentially rich and chronically poor.
   Today, as Brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation,
the Northeast holds it back _ not wholly of its own accord.
   The nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles of land
where Brazil bulges out into the Atlantic. In the area, 2{ times the
size of Texas, live 45 million of the nation's 143 million people.
   But while the prosperous South, with its airplane and computer
factories, has made Brazil the world's eighth-largest economy, the
northeast remains poor, neglected, diseased and assailed by
devastating cyclical droughts.
   Statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast:
   _Infant mortality is higher than in sub-Saharan Africa at 124
deaths per 1,000 births, compared to 67 per 1,000 in the South.
   _Life expectancy is 51 years, compared with 67 in the South.
   _A full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their own
names; 26 percent can't elsewhere in Brazil.
   _Diseases long-eradicated elsewhere _ leprosy, chagas disease,
polio, tuberculosis, even the plague _ still kill and deform in the
northeast.
   ``We're creating a race of undersized subhumans who think only of
survival,'' said Carlos Hollanda Labor, health secretary for the
northeast's Ceara state.
   In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy recognized the
parched region, considered one of the world's poorest, as a possible
source of social unrest. Shortly after Fidel Castro's revolution in
Cuba, Kennedy launched the U.S. Alliance for Progress, which
promised billions of dollars and poured millions into development of
Brazil's northeast _ until a 1964 Brazilian right-wing military coup
eased fears of a communist or left-wing uprising.
   Droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape even
before Portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400
years ago.
   A drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated
250,000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slums
in search of food, water and jobs.
   This year, an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide a
respite for the characteristically small-statured northeasterners,
but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive.
   ``The essential problem here is not whether it rains or not,''
said Ari Guimaraes, head of the political science department of the
University of Bahia, another northeastern state. ``The problem is
that the government hasn't built reservoirs, explored underground
water supplies, irrigated peasant properties or distributed land
among those who have no means to survive.''
   From the 1500s well into the 19th century, the northeast was a
productive area, but the wealth stayed with a few.
   Agriculture led the economic activity, and the vast open spaces
lent themselves to production of Brazil's most precious commodities
at the time: cattle, cotton, sugar, tobacco and much later, coffee.
   The Portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land to nobles
and deserving soldiers. But far from central government control in
the South, northeast landowners set ``wild-west'' laws for peasant
``subjects'' and used private armies to chase individual farmers
from modest-sized lands.
   Such scenes have been pointedly described by Brazil's leading
novelist, Jorge Amado, in ``Gabriela Clove and Cinnamon,'' ``Bahia''
and most recently ``Showdown.''
   Successive governments have made promises to wrench the inland
population from medieval-like poverty, but gun battles over land and
vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common.
   The military government that governed from 1964 through 1985
built dams for hydroelectric power, roads, soccer stadiums and
stretched electricty lines across the dry, cracked land. One tough
military president, the late Gen. Emilio Medici, who is said to have
condoned the torture of political opponents, was on the verge of
tears when he saw the northeast's poverty first hand.
   But the grandiose projects of the military government did little
to ease the average northeasterner's lack of food, jobs, water and
land.
   A common belief among Northesterns is that the few direct
investments in their social concerns, such as food and water
distributions during droughts and emergency work-relief jobs, were
turned to political advantage by local land-owning politicians who
pass along favors to those who vote for them.
   ``It is in the interests of the landowners to maintain the region
in utter poverty,'' claimed Maria Luiza Fontenelle, mayor of
Fortaleza, capital of Ceara and the northeast's largest city, with a
population of 1.6 million.
   ``When people are poor they depend upon favors to survive.''
   According to Bishop Jose Rodrigues of the Roman Catholic Church
in the hinterlands of Bahia, mayors control local unions and decide
who gets access to government health care, jobs and other benefits.
   When the military stepped down and civilian government returned
to Brazil in 1985, hopes for widespread social reforms ran high. But
many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been a hollow
triumph.
   Last year, the region sold $4.4 billion worth of fruit, nuts,
cocoa, sugar, tobacco and petroleum to southern Brazil and foreign
countries but received only $1 billion in government investments.
   Promises of a land reform, irrigation of 2.5 million acres of
land and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of President
Jose Sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit, control
runaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meet
payments on a $121 billion foreign debt.
   Most significantly, Brazil's proposed new constitution makes
virtually impossible a long-promised land reform to distribute the
46 percent of rural properties owned by just 1.2 percent of the
population. The Catholic church has accused the government of bowing
to powerful landowners on the issue.
   But political scientists say the northeast's problems are fast
becoming problems for the rest of the country, most particularly the
more affluent South.
   northeasterners, for example, now occupied whole shanty towns in
the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, pressing already
precarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates.
   ``Brazil will never be a stable democracy ... nor a developed
country without resolving its vast inequalities,'' said one
political scientist, Helio Jaguaribe.
   But the political balance also may be shifting.
   In the 1986 gubernatorial elections, northeasterners chose four
governors who are considered politically progressive and more likely
to contest landowner power.
   Mayor Fontenelle of Fortaleza, for example, is a member of the
Radical Worker's Party.
   At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church presses on its own
for change.
   Bishop Rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11
doceses take control of local labor unions, often resulting in gun
and stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors and
local farmers.
   In Jucas, a town of 8,000 people 300 miles west of Fortaleza, the
Rev. Hans Stecker, a German priest who arrived 28 years ago, wages a
relentless battle with Mayor Jose Fagundes, also the town's largest
landowner.
   The priest has built a hospital, 39 schools and pre-schools and
started health and education programs. Stecker said that in response
to his projects the three-term mayor cut church's telephone lines
and prohibited the teaching of religion in town schools.
   ``In some towns,'' said political scientist Guimaraes, ``the
local priest can't leave home without a gun.''

   The chaotic development that is gobbling up the
Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan
developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists
from around the world.
   ``That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain
forest in recent years,'' said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist
at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist.
   ``It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing
to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil,
except bad news,'' Lovejoy said in a recent interview.
   Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain
forest, lies in Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight
surrounding countries.
   Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in
mid-January in Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people
in the heart of the Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's
once-thriving rubber trade.
   The workshop, which brought together all the governments and
scientists with interests in the rain forest, culminated with a
plan to regulate development in up to 80 percent of the Amazon
region.
   It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation
priorities, the meeting's participants said.
   The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for
national conservation programs, participants said.
   Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called
multiple-use development, which preserves the forest while allowing
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and
medicinal plants.
   Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle
ranching or farming, has been ambivalent about the need to conserve
the Amazon.
   Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the
setting of priorities was ``all done with the blessing of Brazil,''
Lovejoy said.
   Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands
of plant andanimal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30 percent
of the world's plant and animal species.
   One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken
from the deep shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants
representing 50 species.
   Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives
without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid
species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom.
   At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small
groups to assess conservation priorities.
   Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators.
Mammologists took inventory of the Amazon's screeching monkeys.
Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats
fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same.
   Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the
Amazon. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the Amazon.
   ``The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no
way of getting around that,'' said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International and an authority on endangered
monkeys.
   Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along
with multiple-use areas where some development could occur.
   It is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80
percent of the Amazon, he said. Only the most critical areas should
be placed off limits to development.
   ``Ten to 20 percent of the entire Amazon should be in protected
parks or preserves, ideally,'' he said. At present, 2 percent of
the Amazon is protected.
   Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan.
   ``The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards
the work that has got to be done,'' said Stanley Malone, director
of the Suriname Forest Service.
   Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978
to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone
said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which
areas most needed protection.
   That determination has now been made, based on the number of
different species a given area contained, and on how many of those
species were endemic, or unique, to the area.
   ``Now we'll have to see what develops from this,'' Mittermeier
said. A new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, will be
inaugurated March 15, and with him will come a new Brazilian
environmental policy.
   Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is
uncertain. ``As always, everything depends on key individuals,''
Mittermeier said.
   ``I'm basically always optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel sure that
we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of
work.''
