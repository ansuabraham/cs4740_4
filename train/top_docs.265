   Voyager 2 brushed by Neptune's north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked Triton, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' NASA said Friday.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m PDT Friday.
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told hundreds of scientists
and dignitaries Friday at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedingly
delighted to be here on this very historic day for America and
America's space program.''
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons in
addition to Nereid and frost-covered Triton, which were first
observed from Earth.
   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around
the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will
also prove to be a complete ring.
   Voyager's closest photos of Triton were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this weekend, but those returned Friday astounded
scientists. Soderblom said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone.
   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been
seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some other moons, ``it's the first
time we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one of
the huge craters on Triton. ``This is a real volcano.''
   But Stone noted that Triton's volcanoes are ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''
   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across.
   Other Triton photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying
cliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier
terrain,'' JPL scientist Torrence Johnson said. ``They're like
things you see in polar caps on Mars.''
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' Soderblom said, adding that the faults suggest
``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.
   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``erupted
plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys
or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is
``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''
Soderblom said.
   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices
and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.
   Earth and Jupiter's moon Io are the only objects in the solar
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active.
   Voyager also revealed Triton has an atmosphere, as predicted.
It's content wasn't immediately determined, but NASA said the haze
might be like photochemical smog.
   Stone said the discovery that Triton's surface once was
geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting
moon _ about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon _ once was a
comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around Neptune.
   Under that theory, Triton initially would have orbited Neptune in
a long ellipse, but Neptune's gravity slowly pulled it into a
circular orbit, making Triton a semi-molten, geologically active
ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Saturday, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from
Earth and 1.385 million miles from Neptune, speeding away from the
giant planet at 37,847 mph.
   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in Neptune's bluish
atmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands of
miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone
called the Great Dark Spot.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its trip to Neptune followed a
4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75
billion miles from Earth.
   Voyager 1 also was launched in 1977, exploring Jupiter in 1979
and Saturn in 1980 before speeding out of the plane of the planets.
   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends Oct. 2, Voyager
2 will look back over its shoulder at Neptune. Then it, like Voyager
1, will head toward interstellar space.
   ``Voyager 2 is now past Neptune and is continuing to press
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''
NASA administrator Richard Truly said. ``The Voyagers are destined
to wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they will
encounter.''
   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of NASA, called the
climax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time
we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the
reconnaissance of the planets, except Pluto.''

   Voyager 1, which joined its twin
exploring the outer solar system, will snap pictures this week to
make an unprecedented family portrait of most of the planets and
the vast empty space between them.
   ``It will speak more to the mind than to the eye because of the
tremendous distances. What will be impressive will be the
distances,'' said Jurrie van der Woude, a spokesman at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The complete portrait will be too large to be published, but
NASA may assemble the 64 eight-by-10-inch photos into a mosaic
stretching 100 to 150 feet along a wall at the laboratory.
   Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth and Venus will
appear as tiny dots against a background of dark space and the
constellation Eridanus.
   Mercury will be hidden by the sun's glare. Pluto is too distant
to appear in any images.
   While the solar system portrait won't have scientific value, its
purpose is ``really historical,'' said Bob MacMillin, a spokesman
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``This is not just the first time, but perhaps the only time for
decades that we'll be able to take a picture of the planets from
outside the solar system,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward
Stone.
   Voyager 1, which is about 3.7 billion miles from Earth, will use
its two cameras to photograph the planets and the sun between 5:15
p.m. and 9:20 p.m. PST Tuesday night.
   Because of other demands on NASA Deep Space Network tracking
antennas, the photos won't be sent back to Earth until late March,
and it will be late April until they are processed and can be
assembled into a mosaic, MacMillin said.
   The twin Voyager spacecraft were launched from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 2 explored
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and Neptune last August. Voyager 1
explored Saturn in 1980, then flew above the plane in which the
planets orbit the sun, known as the ecliptic plane.
   Photographing the sun for the solar system portrait may warp the
shutter blades on Voyager 1's wide-angle camera, but there are no
plans to use the camera again anyway, NASA said.
   Voyager 1 will take the photos for the solar system portrait by
looking down from a position 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane.
Stone said no future missions are planned that would send a
spacecraft so high above the ecliptic plane.
   Voyager 1 was chosen to make the photograph because it is in
better position that Voyager 2.
   Both spacecraft are now studying electrically charged particles
and magnetic fields as they fly toward interstellar space. They are
expected to return at least limited measurements for another 25 to
30 years.

<HEAD>NASA Experiment Gets Galileo to Send Venus Photos Early</HEAD>

   NASA engineers were unwilling to wait
until October to see the Galileo spacecraft's photographs of Venus,
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures
sent to Earth early.
   One of the photos released Wednesday shows clouds as small as 25
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere.
It was taken Monday night when the Jupiter-bound Galileo was about
1 million miles past Venus, the second planet from the sun.
   ``You can see clouds, and you can see some very interesting
detail in the cloud patterns,'' said Neal Ausman, Galileo mission
director at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``The engineers and scientists are
exceptionally pleased.''
   Galileo is scheduled to go into orbit around Jupiter in December
1995 in a $1.35 billion mission to study the solar system's largest
planet. Just before 10 p.m. PST last Friday, the spacecraft swooped
about 10,025 miles over Venus so that planet could act as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to Jupiter.
   Most of the photographs and other data collected during and
after the flyby won't be sent back until October, when the
spacecraft is closer to Earth. Galileo's main antenna now is furled
to protect it from the heat of the sun. A smaller antenna, which
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate, is
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft.
   But NASA engineers were able to get Galileo to send the three
photos back to Earth on Monday and Tuesday by transferring separate
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio
transmission, Ausman said.
   NASA spokesman Jim Wilson called the technique ``experimental
and difficult.''
   Ausman said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study Venus'
lower atmosphere, as well as ultraviolet light measurements and
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in
space around Venus.
   By the time Galileo's fly-by of Venus formally ends Friday
night, the spacecraft's television camera will have taken about 80
pictures of cloud-shrouded Venus.
   Many other spacecraft have photographed Venus, some from much
closer than Galileo. But the new photos still should have
scientific value, Ausman said.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18 on a looping 2.4 billion, six-year route that requires Venus and
Earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to
Jupiter. It will fly past Earth on Dec. 8, then again on Dec. 8,
1992.
   Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, the Voyager
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the
solar system, according to JPL spokeswoman Mary Hardin.
   Voyager 1, which photographed Jupiter in 1980 and Saturn in
1981, was ordered to shoot the pictures Tuesday evening. But it
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs
to travel the 3.7 billion miles to Earth, Hardin said Wednesday.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward Neptune, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from Earth.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone, referring to
Voyager's previous exploration of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the next week,'' Stone
said during a late morning news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for Thursday's close encounter with Neptune and
Friday's flight past its largest moon, Triton. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means Voyager will fly closest to Neptune about 8:55 p.m. PDT
Thursday.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at 8:15 a.m. PDT today indicating the thrusters
started firing at 4:09 a.m. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with Neptune has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' says Jurrie van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around Neptune's north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of Triton and another moon,
Nereid. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to Neptune, cable television stations will
carry live NASA broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which had been discovered from Earth,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting Neptune.
   Voyager also discovered Neptune has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like Earth's jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   NASA listed Voyager's position as of 9 a.m. today as 2.743
billion miles from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   Neptune, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   Thursday night, Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus
in 1986.
   Sunday was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
Florida on Aug. 20, 1977. The Neptune encounter is the climax of the
$865 million, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the Neptune encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will conduct daily news conferences through Aug. 29.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling Saturn and Uranus.
   They also say Neptune's magnetic field may create auroras like
Earth's northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind Neptune.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
Neptune's atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside Neptune.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

   From 3.8 billion miles, the Earth is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said Wednesday as NASA released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in February and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded Feb. 13-14 but were not played back to Earth until
late March because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Earth and Venus.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, Mercury was too close to the sun
to be photographed and Pluto was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, Earth was within a band of sunlight but
Sagan said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
August and September 1977 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years 2000 and 2010. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in 1975.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
Jupiter, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in 1962.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except Pluto,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on June 22 when it was
57.2 million miles from Neptune. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released Wednesday by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which called it ``the
best color photo of Neptune taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its Aug. 24 close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from Earth, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of Neptune. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot or Earth's
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on Jupiter, Saturn and apparently on Neptune are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe Earth's jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said Hansen and Caltech planetary
scientist Andrew Ingersoll.
   Jupiter's 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on Neptune,
Stone said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on Saturn, he added.
   Stone said that on Jupiter, and possibly Neptune, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. Jupiter's
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from Neptune to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
Neptune's atmosphere, said Rich Terrile, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying Neptune's atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' Terrile said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., in 1977.
   They explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in 1980
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and will fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's north pole cloudtops at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   Five hours later it will encounter Neptune's backward-orbiting
moon, Triton, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
Pluto's elongated orbit Neptune will be the ninth and outermost
until 2007.

   Voyager 2 plunged over Neptune's north
pole and today took its closest look at the moon Triton, discovering
dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults
and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic
exploration of four planets.
   ``This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory
astronomer Rich Terrile said after the 12-year-old spaceship made
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. Neptune ``is not
a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real
place.''
   The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above Neptune's icy
north pole cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. PDT Thursday _ the closest of its
planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by Neptune's gravity
to a speed of 61,148 mph.
   Its photos of Triton revealed that Neptune's major moon has
large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said
Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.
   ``It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a
moon of Uranus, Stone said. ``This is a real volcano.''
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said today in a speech to
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Reiterating President Bush's July statement in support of an
eventual permanent base on the Earth's moon and a manned trip to
Mars, Quayle declared: ``We Americans have been opening new
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so.
Today, space is America's frontier.''
   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, called the climax of the
Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time we're seeing a
planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the
planets, except Pluto.''
   Five hours after the rendezvous with Neptune, the spaceship made
its closest pass by the moon Triton at 2:10 a.m., a flyby that was
confirmed when signals reached Earth at 6:16 a.m. PDT.
   The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's
radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to Earth.
   The array of information on Neptune's largest moon had
scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about Neptune
itself.
   ``Triton will upstage Neptune. It's filled with hummocky,
rippling terrain,'' Terrile said.
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' said Laurence Soderblom, of the U.S. Geological Survey. The
faults suggest that ``Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time
on the moon.
   Later, Joseph Boyce, a NASA geologist, said there was ``abundant
evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like
substance rather than molten rock.
   Voyager's newest photos of Triton received this morning showed a
smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that Boyce said
measured several hundred miles across.
   ``It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,''
Boyce said. ``It looks like some sort of feature flooded by
material, and the material is probably volcanic material.''
   The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows
on Uranus' moon Ariel in 1986, and earlier found active
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of Jupiter.
   Boyce emphasized there is no evidence yet that Triton's icy
volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the
crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so.
   Earlier, Bradford Smith, head of Voyager's photographic imaging
team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had described Triton's
surface in photos taken Thursday as ``extremely strange and
puzzling.''
   The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and
``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist
Torrence Johnson said.
   While difficult to interpret, the early photos of Triton gave
``the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and
alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white
topography that is ``closer to flat than big mountains,'' said
Smith, who called the pictures ``Just short of spectacular.''
   At 11:59 p.m. PDT, signals were received showing that Voyager had
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it
passed through the plane containing Neptune's rings, said Donald
Gurnett. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the
spacecraft, Gurnett said.
   Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the
spaceship's near encounter with Neptune, Smith said.
   ``There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. ``We are all very
excited.''
   Scientists announced Thursday that Voyager discovered two more
tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a
60-mile-wide moon designated 1989 N5, and the even smaller 1989 N6,
which is a mere 30 miles wide.
   That brought the number of Neptune's moons discovered before the
close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from
Earth _ Triton and Nereid _ and four found earlier by Voyager.
   Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling Neptune,
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc.
Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from
Neptune almost certainly also is a complete ring.
   During its flight past Neptune and Triton, Voyager was programmed
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study
their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the
rings and search for others; and take its best but still
2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid.
   Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of
Neptune's atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds,
high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other
cyclones.
   NASA calculated Voyager's position during the Neptune flyby as
nearly 2.75 billion miles from Earth. But the ship had traveled a
curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in
1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   Champagne flowed at the laboratory Thursday when Voyager crossed
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets Neptune's
magnetic field.
   Earlier pictures of Triton suggested the backward-orbiting moon
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural
gas on its pink-and-blue surface.
   Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry
to aim a space probe built with 1960s technology, NASA engineers
said Thursday they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was
supposed to be after the long journey.
   ``Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer.
   Voyager 1 visited Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and now is
speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after
it stops studying Neptune on Oct. 2.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but Pluto's
elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making Neptune temporarily
the solar system's outmost planet.
   ``Someday there ought to be a Pluto flyby,'' Fisk said. ``But
there are no active plans to do that.''

   The Galileo spaceship swooped past Venus
early Saturday, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at 12:59 a.m. EST, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said Bill O'Neil, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting Galileo to Jupiter has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
Earth confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered Galileo's infrared
light sensor to start observing Venus. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, O'Neil said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier Friday, Galileo studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said Galileo project scientist Torrence Johnson. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
Jupiter.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director Neal Ausman.
   The $1.35 billion mission will let Galileo examine Earth, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995, they
arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mercury,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on Earth. Venus is about 95
percent as wide as Earth. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give Galileo a boost for
its trip to Jupiter by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the Earth as a slingshot next Dec. 8 and again
on Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward Jupiter,
Ausman said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having Galileo's camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting Thursday night and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
Galileo's four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to Earth
until October, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past Earth.
   Galileo was programmed to photograph Venus and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with Venus'
atmosphere. At the same time, NASA arranged for the Pioneer Venus
Orbiter, circling Venus since 1978, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, Johnson said.
   While nearly 20 other U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited
Venus, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have Galileo send back a small
amount of data, Johnson added.
   Studies from Earth and previous spacecraft indicate Venus has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing Mount Everest and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least 70 percent of Venus'
surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally
planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching
it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. NASA decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So Galileo was launched with a much weaker Inertial Upper Stage
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required NASA to redesign Galileo's route so the craft could
utilize gravity from Venus and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to Jupiter.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop NASA from having a
shuttle carry Galileo into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate Florida with plutonium in Galileo's
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. NASA said the
risk was minimal.
   Galileo is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered Jupiter's major moons.

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of Venus and the
evolution of our own Earth.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday, and six hours later,
Atlantis' five astronauts are to release Magellan on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in 1978, and Magellan will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches Venus in August 1990, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and Venus, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the 1978 Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   Magellan is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from Atlantis this year. The Galileo probe to Jupiter is
to set forth in October.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in 1986. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in January 1986, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Saunders said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
Russia's Venera 1, which scouted Venus in 1961. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The United States has successfully sent five probes to Venus,
six to Mars, four to Jupiter, three to Saturn, and one each to
Mercury and Uranus. And in August, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at Neptune.
   The Soviet Union has sent 19 successful spacecraft to Venus and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 last September while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of Jupiter; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of Saturn; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, NASA is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet Earth, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of Earth when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that Venus may represent what
might happen to Earth if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 is converging on
Neptune, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager
at the National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on Neptune that may be
a giant storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, Voyager will swoop within 3,000 miles of
Neptune's north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, Voyager will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, Triton. The other known
moon is Nereid.
   Voyager 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and an array of sensors,
were launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977. They visited Jupiter in
1979 and Saturn in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 2 reached
Uranus in 1986. Voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space.
   Voyager 1 and 2 returned 65,000 photographs of Jupiter, Saturn
and their moons and rings. Voyager 2 sent back 8,000 pictures of
Uranus and its moons, and will take another 8,000 of Neptune.
   At a cost Haynes pegged at $865 million through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.
   Neptune, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times Earth's size and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit
Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting Neptune, said
physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from Earth, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
Earth's hurricanes or Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving Neptune's storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
Neptune _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, Stone said.
   Despite any internal heat, Neptune receives 900 times less
sunlight than Earth, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on Triton,
Stone said.
   Scientists believe Triton _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of Earth's moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to four more active ice volcanoes on
Neptune's moon Triton were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager
2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the
fastest yet seen in the solar system.
   Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly
five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of
Triton, ``chances are that there are a dozen of these things going
off globally'' at any time, said Torrence Johnson, a planetary
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2
after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug.
24-25 flight past Neptune and Triton.
   Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced Tuesday
during a news conference at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Triton is only the third world in the solar system known to have
active volcanism. The others are Earth and Jupiter's moon Io, which
has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are
volcanoes on cloud-shrouded Venus.
   Neptune's jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas
past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like
Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in
Neptune's atmosphere.
   ``These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the
previous record winds of 1,100 mph in Saturn's jet stream, Stone
said. ``These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is
Mach 1.''
   The speed of sound on Earth is about 700 mph, depending on
temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in Earth's air.
   The clouds racing in Neptune's winds could be seen in a movie
made by computer from still photographs taken by Voyager. Also
shown at Tuesday's news conference was another computer movie
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on Triton,
Neptune's largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar
system.
   The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts
back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud
also is visible.
   The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three
more plumes, Johnson said.
   When Voyager swept past Triton early Aug. 25, scientists saw
streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what
they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced it
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic
analysis of the photos.
   But the images were so fuzzy ``you had to take our word for
it,'' Johnson said.
   So NASA used a computer to overlap still photos taken from
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes.
   The causes of Triton's nitrogen ice volcanoes and Neptune's high
winds are mysterious.
   Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material
settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent
nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker
material beneath. But the heat cannot escape through the ice, so
some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build
until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark
material with it.
   Neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than Earth. Scientists are
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from Neptune's
formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot,
not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15
and 20 degrees south latitude, Stone said.
   Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in
the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is
needed to power high winds, he said.
   Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission
in which it flew past Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The spacecraft
discovered six moons at Neptune, bringing the total to eight, and
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30
times farther from the sun than Earth.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 is converging on
Neptune, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager
at the National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on Nep
a giant storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, Voyager will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
Neptune's north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, Voyager will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, Triton. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.
   Neptune, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times Earth's size and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit
Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting Neptune, said
physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from Earth, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
Earth's hurricanes or Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving Neptune's storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
Neptune _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, Stone said.
   Despite any internal heat, Neptune receives 900 times less
sunlight than Earth, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on Triton,
Stone said.
   Scientists believe Triton _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of Earth's moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Voyager's pictures of Neptune's moon
Triton _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have
been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the
spacecraft's cameras, NASA says.
   ``It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said Rich Terrile,
an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``It would have been an incredible
disappointment.''
   ``They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone said Monday.
   Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that Triton is
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that Neptune
has something in common with Los Angeles: smog.
   Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to Neptune
last Thursday and zipped past Triton on Friday, scientists
recognized that the frosty surface of Neptune's largest moon
reflected much more light than originally expected, said Mary Beth
Murrill, a JPL spokeswoman.
   Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68
seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of Triton, Murrill
said.
   Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas,
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square
miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen
particles 20 miles skyward.
   During its Neptune encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six
moons in addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from
Earth. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad
rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   NASA engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said Lanny Miller, manager of the flight
engineering office.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 4.55 million miles behind Neptune, speeding toward the
edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph.
   Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined Triton's surface
temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon
``the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said Roger
Yelle of the University of Arizona.
   Scientists believe Pluto and its moon Charon are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   Voyager also found smog on Neptune.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's
atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of
photochemical smog at the bottom of Neptune's stratosphere, said Jim
Pollock, an imaging team member from NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif.
   ``Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an
atmosphere,'' imaging team leader Bradford Smith said of other
planets and moons.
   ``In Los Angeles, the problem is it's happening way down low
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen
except on Titan,'' he said, referring to Saturn's smoggy moon.
   In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon
1989 N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its
lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1,
one of the six moons discovered by Voyager since June, Smith said.
   Voyager found earlier that 1989 N1 really is Neptune's
second-largest moon after Triton. Scientists previously thought
Nereid was No. 2.
   Instruments aboard Voyager discovered Neptune is encircled by
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape,
called a torus.
   The torus is created by gases coming off of Triton, said Ralph
McNutt, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jupiter is
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur
volcanoes on the Jovian moon Io.
   The space probe also found Neptune and Triton have auroras
vaguely like Earth's northern and southern lights. They glow in
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however,
unlike Earth's visible auroras.
   Voyager's close encounter with Neptune last week capped its epic
tour of the four outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus. The probe was launched in 1977 along with its twin, Voyager
1, which explored only Jupiter and Saturn.

   The Galileo spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with Earth next week so it can reach Jupiter in
1995, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said Thursday.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the Dec. 8 flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at Earth as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' Bill O'Neil, Galileo project
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989, starting its $1.4 billion, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in December 1995, the Galileo orbiter will spend two
years exploring Jupiter and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in Jupiter's atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   Galileo's route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and Earth as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach Jupiter. It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992. It used Venus as a
gravity slingshot last February.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and Earth. Data collected
at Venus was stored on Galileo's tape recorder and sent to Earth
last week.
   Galileo's optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of Venus' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But Galileo's infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in Venus' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, NASA scientist Robert Carlson
said.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.
   Galileo also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from Venus, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said University of Iowa physicist Louis
Frank.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around Venus. Scientists played the tape Thursday.
   Galileo will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest Atlantic
Ocean at 3:35 p.m. EST Dec. 8. Galileo was 4.46 million miles from
Earth on Thursday.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy Earth's protective ozone
layer, Johnson said.
   Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from Earth, he added.

   The Galileo space probe, heading for Jupiter
on a six-year roundabout journey, will fly past the planet Venus
late Friday and early Saturday and gain momentum for the second leg
of the trip _ back toward Earth.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said
Galileo will be 10,028 miles above Venus' cloud tops when it makes
its closest approach at 9:59 p.m. Pacific time, Friday.
   Although the space probe's instruments will be recording
information about Venus _ Earth's closest planetary neighbor _ the
data won't be played back for scientists until October.
   Galileo was launched last October 18 from the cargo bay of the
space shuttle Atlantis. After passing Venus and gaining slingshot
momentum from that flyby, the $1.5 billion probe loops back and
will come within 620 miles of Earth in December.
   With that added second push, Galileo once more will head out
into deep space and return in 1992, coming as close as 200 miles of
Earth before it starts out for Jupiter where it will arrive in
December 1995.
   There, a robot will separate from the main spacecraft and plunge
through the gaseous atmosphere of the solar system's largest
planet. Galileo itself will orbit the planet for two years taking
scientific measurements.
   Galileo carries a 49-pound nuclear generator to provide
electricity to power the craft's instruments. Similar generators
have been used on other deep space probes, including Voyager, which
last year sent back photographs as it passed Neptune, at that point
the planet farthest from the Earth.

   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past Neptune this week for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at JPL,'' joked Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, Sunday was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from Florida on Aug. 20, 1977.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' said Jurrie van der Woude, a JPL spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday, when Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   As of 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction Monday morning, NASA engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the Neptune flyby.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct
daily news conferences starting Monday and continuing through Aug.
29.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of Neptune's
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were discovered from Earth. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on Earth, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle Saturn and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting Neptune.
   _A magnetic field surrounding Neptune, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like Earth's northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   The Neptune encounter is the climax of the $865 million,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Haynes said Monday's course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind
Neptune.
   Ellis Miner, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine Neptune's atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside Neptune.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to Earth
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, Miner said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to Earth, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with Neptune, Voyager will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, Voyager will start a 49-minute trip through
Neptune's shadow. Instead of photographing Neptune during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

   Voyager 2 cruised away from Neptune and
toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $865 million trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from Earth and 4.2 million
miles beyond Neptune, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from Earth in 1977, past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in
1981 and Uranus in 1986, and now past Neptune in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980.
   For $865 million _ 20 cents per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like Jupiter's moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
Voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At Neptune, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to Nereid
and Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish Triton. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than a half billion years ago, said U.S. Geological Survey
geologist Laurence Soderblom.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on Triton's surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune's
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the Earth.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of Magellan,'' said
Planetary Society vice president Bruce Murray, former director of
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of Earth, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
Sagan said.
   He said Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned of
depletion of Earth's ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help NASA understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.
   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on Venus, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   Sagan said Voyager also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until 2020.

   Discovery of a magnetic field around
Neptune suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but
NASA hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies
past the planet.
   ``Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said Norm
Haynes, Voyager project manager at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Similar radiation belts at Jupiter disrupted Voyager's internal
clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the
wrong time.
   Today, Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from Earth and 5.01 million
miles from Neptune, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251
mph.
   The ship will make its closest approach to Neptune at 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of
the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was
launched in 1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and
Uranus in 1986.
   NASA announced Friday that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike
radio signals coming from Neptune _ strong evidence the planet has a
magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed
electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere
along magnetic field lines.
   Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have magnetic fields.
Venus and Mars do not. Whether Pluto has one is unknown, NASA said.
   Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a
planet's core. Molten iron in Earth's core, for example, creates a
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the Van Allen belts.
   Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a
nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft
electronics.
   So far at Neptune, ``there's nothing to indicate it (the
radiation) is anything worse than we expected,'' said Haynes. ``But
time will tell.''
   Existence of Neptune's magnetic field suggests the planet has an
aurora like Earth's northern and southern lights, created when
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a
planet's poles.
   Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists
determine the exact length of a day on Neptune _ now believed to be
between 17 and 18 Earth hours _ and gain better understanding of
Neptune's internal structure, said Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spokeswoman Mary Beth Murrill.
   Voyager project scientist Edward Stone has said he believes
Neptune's hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center.
   That would mean that Neptune, like neighboring Uranus, probably
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in
color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause similar radiation
darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, NASA said.
   NASA on Friday also released new photographs taken by Voyager.
Blurry black-and-white images show markings on Triton, Neptune's
largest moon, but ``it is still too early to tell if the features
are clouds or features on Triton's surface,'' NASA said.
   A color photo of Neptune shows complex, frequently changing
weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy
clouds, a small cloud dubbed ``the scooter'' because it rotates
quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks.
   In recent weeks, Voyager also has discovered four Neptunian moons
besides two observed from Earth; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of
debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet
streams on Earth.

   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched since 1978, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around Venus today on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said George Alexander, chief spokesman for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
NASA and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the Hubble Space Telescope, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   Magellan dived over Venus' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at 9:32 a.m., slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed Magellan to be captured by Venus' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
Steve Wall.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
Venus, out of radio contact with engineers on Earth. Magellan
emerged at 9:53 a.m., but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time Magellan's radio
signal takes to reach Earth.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said David Okerson, a Magellan project
engineer.
   In the Magellan project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary Sharon Kyle.
   Magellan encountered Venus 144 million miles from Earth after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The $413 million Magellan, the heart of a $744 million mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by Sept. 1.
   NASA plans to release the first pictures in September, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   Magellan has raised NASA's hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Wesley T. Huntress Jr., NASA director of solar system exploration,
said Thursday. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot Magellan, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since 1978,
when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
Venus.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' Huntress said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
between 1979 and last year, but they were launched in 1977.
Galileo, launched in October, is headed toward a 1995 rendezvous
with Jupiter.
   During the coming decade or so, NASA also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, Saturn, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   NASA has said Magellan would return more data than all previous
NASA missions combined.
   Venus is similar to Earth in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   NASA wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to Earth's. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   Magellan was named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by Martin Marietta Corp. and its radar
was built by Hughes Aircraft Co.

   The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus,
relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with
Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was
working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to
sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August.
   Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because,
unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north
and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that
Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center.
Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an
ancient collision with another celestial object.
   Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About
5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some
6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an
Earth-size molten core of heavier materials.
   The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's
previously recorded five satellites. Uranus was thought to have
nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which
are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are
made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.
   The Voyagers also discovered a ring around Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons.
   During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier
Pioneers 10 and 11, found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid
hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly
hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for
centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous
atmospheric storm similar to Earth's hurricanes.
   The space probes detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like Earth's northern
lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying
pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes
the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the sun.
   Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by Saturn, astronomers
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six
rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet
at various speeds.
   The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the
total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an
atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to
form Titan's surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval Earth between three and
four billion years ago.
   The Voyagers also found Saturn's atmosphere of hydrogen and
helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph.
   Venus, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly
resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density than any
of the other planets. However, Mariner and Pioneer probes found
that Venus is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide.
   Radar peering through Venus' thick cloud cover found evidence of
two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over
these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been
created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart
like similar processes on Earth.
   Photographs taken of Mercury by Mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975
revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling
our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing
the planet.
   Instruments aboard Mariner 10 found that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the
density of the Earth's and composed chiefly of argon, neon and
helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950
degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero
on the shadowed side.
   Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But
the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976 and 1977
were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments
designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests
indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results
could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the Vikings.
   The Vikings and earlier Mariners found that dust covers the
Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to
stir up fierce summer storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the
landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by
flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists
believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

SPACE: IN REALITY, IT'S JUST THE GALILEO SPACECRAFT SWINGING BY ON ITS WAY TO 
STUDY JUPITER. SCIENTISTS ARE EXCITED BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW EARTH AS 
IF FROM AN ALIEN SHIP.

On its convoluted journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft swung by Earth on 
Saturday, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:35 p.m., only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the $1.5-billion nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It was virtually perfect," said William J. O'Neil, Galileo's project manager 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design manager at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the Earth and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 
</P>
<P>
Two extremely sharp photographs taken Saturday by Galileo, one of the Earth and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes of these recorded images, Galileo will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the Earth after 
visiting another planet," O'Neil said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to Earth." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the Earth and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one JPL scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the Earth encounter went, 
scientists at JPL realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to Jupiter can be labeled a success. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step will take place Oct. 29, when Galileo passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on Dec. 8, 1992, it will have its second encounter with Earth, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Both swings around the Earth, as well as a rendezvous with Venus last February, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
As Galileo raced by Earth, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When Galileo scoots by Earth two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to Jupiter, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
When Galileo arrives at Jupiter late in 1995, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the summer of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into Jupiter's stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
Jupiter's four major moons with one of Earth's first telescopes.

   Voyager 2, only a day away from its close
encounter with Neptune, was ready for new computer commands today as
it searched for more moons and rings after discovering a first
complete ring around the storm-wracked planet.
   A new picture taken by Voyager shows what appears to be a large
meteorite crater on Triton, Neptune's major moon, deputy project
scientist Ellis Miner said today.
   Howewver, he said, there also are uncratered regions on the moon,
and scientists haven't yet definitely concluded the spot on the
still-fuzzy Triton picture is an impact crater.
   Engineers prepared to send Voyager the computer program this
afternoon to control how the spacecraft aims itself, its cameras and
other sensors during its flight past Neptune and Triton, said Doug
Griffith, deputy mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest navigation information shows that after a 12-year,
4.4-billion-mile flight, Voyager will be within one second and 22
miles of where it is supposed to be for the Neptune flyby, he said.
   ``The spacecraft is working marvelously, with no problems at
all,'' Griffith said.
   He said the new computer program, smaller than that contained in
many popular computer games, is crucial to experiments in which
Voyager will study the makeup of the atmospheres of Neptune and
Triton by sending radio waves through their atmospheres to Earth.
   Griffith said the new navigation data shows Voyager will make its
closest approach by flying 3,000 miles above Neptune's cloudtops at
18 seconds before 8:56 p.m. PDT Thursday.
   Until today's search for more moons, ``suspects have been seen
here and there,'' said Bradford Smith, a University of Arizona
planetary scientist who heads Voyager's photographic imaging team.
``I would expect several more satellites.''
   So far, Voyager has found four small moons besides Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were first seen years ago from Earth.
   After Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune, the probe
may find a sheet of ring material encircling the planet _ similar to
the broad band of dust it discovered around Uranus in 1986,
laboratory astronomer Rich Terrile said.
   Smith announced Tuesday the spacecraft found at least one
complete ring of diffuse debris orbiting Neptune. He said a partial
ring discovered by the spacecraft almost two weeks ago also may
prove to be a second complete ring. It has parts that are thicker
than other parts.
   Tuesday's find, the latest in a string of discoveries by the
probe during passes by Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus,
elated scientists.
   ``I like the idea Voyager is going out with a bang. It's going to
blow our minds,'' said Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist with the
University of Arizona, Tucson.
   Pictures taken by Voyager on Aug. 11 revealed two partial rings _
or ring arcs _ extending around Neptune. One of them couldn't be
found in later images and was dubbed the ``lost arc,'' until Voyager
relocated it Tuesday and found it goes all the way around the planet.
   Finding a complete ring was surprising. Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone said two months ago the planet might be orbited by 50
to 100 ring arcs, but he backed away from that Tuesday.
   About 9 o'clock PDT tonight, Voyager will cross within 1 million
miles of Neptune, speeding toward the giant gaseous planet at 38,047
mph. It will be about 2.75 billion miles from Earth, having traveled
a curving path of 4.4 billion miles since it was launched in 1977.
   At 2:10 a.m. Friday, Voyager will zip within 24,000 miles of the
moon Triton.
   Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to visit the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory several hours later to congratulate Voyager
scientists and engineers.
   Voyager was programmed to search today for more rings and arcs _
including any that might be in or near Triton's orbit _ and to look
for ``shepherd moons.'' Rings get their shape from the pull of
gravity between a planet and its moons, so moons that corral rings
are called shepherd moons.
   Today's picture-snapping schedule also included 30 images of
Triton, four photos of one of the moons Voyager discovered, and 22
pictures of Neptune and its surprisingly turbulent weather, with
racing clouds and an Earth-sized cyclone.
   Because of its bluish color and bright clouds, ``Neptune looks
Earthlike,'' Porco said. ``With clouds floating in the atmosphere,
it looks homey.''
   The space probe also was to measure temperatures at various
altitudes in Neptune's atmosphere.
   Some scientists have said arcs and rings could be the remnants of
moons torn apart by gravitational forces, but Porco said it was more
likely some of them form when moons collide.
   ``We've now seen four different ring systems at four different
planets,'' Terrile said, citing Saturns vast system of broad rings,
Jupiter's single narrow ring, and Uranus' 10 thin rings and one
broad sheet of dust that seems to contain dozens of rings.
   ``I find it intriguing to think that in coming to all these
planets, we're seeing ring systems at different stages of
evolution,'' Porco said. ``They have complexity in common. Each
planet is so damn different than the next.''
   The existence of moons and rings around planets in our solar
system suggests ``the processes that formed the Earth are common,''
bolstering the belief that planets orbit stars other than the sun,
Terrile said.

   Voyager 2, now 12 days from its close
encounter with Neptune, has made another discovery that thrilled
scientists: two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar system's
fourth-largest planet.
   ``There is a mood of total elation here,'' said astronomer Rich
Terrile, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're really just ecstatic. ... Everything
we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.''
   Early Friday, Voyager 2 photographed the two partial rings,
called ``ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the
complete rings that encircle Saturn, Uranus and Jupiter.
   Since early July, Voyager has discovered four small moons
orbiting Neptune in addition to the previously known moons, Nereid
and Triton.
   The probe also has discovered 2,700-mile-wide dark bands _
possibly jet stream-like belts of windblown clouds _ forming a
collar around Neptune's south pole and possibly its north pole.
Voyager 2 earlier revealed a 6,200-mile-wide dark spot in the
planet's atmosphere, probably a giant storm like Jupiter's Great
Red Spot.
   Today, Voyager 2, traveling at 42,198 mph, was 2.72 billion
miles from Earth and 11.3 million miles from Neptune, the fourth
largest planet of the solar system and eighth planet from the sun.
   On Aug. 24, Voyager 2 is expected to fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's cloudtops. The probe was launched in 1977, and explored
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   One of the two ring arcs detected Friday extends one-eighth of
the distance around Neptune's equator, and the other only
one-thirty-sixth around the planet. That makes them about 30,000
miles and 6,000 miles long, respectively, NASA said. Terrile said
they may prove longer upon closer examination.
   ``Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of
debris associated with nearby moons, or may be remnants of moons
that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions,'' NASA
said.
   Scientists don't yet know if the ring arcs are made up of dust,
pebbles or boulders, or if the debris consists primarily of rock or
ice, said University of Arizona planetary scientist Brad Smith, who
heads the team analyzing photographs taken by the spacecraft.
   Researchers also don't know if the two partial rings found by
Voyager are among the three to six ring arcs that scientists
previously believed they detected from Earth, but ``it would be
surprising if they weren't,'' he added.
   Voyager project scientist Edward Stone has said Voyager may
discover 50 to 100 partial rings orbiting Neptune.
   ``Astronomers have long suspected the existence of ... an
irregular ring system around Neptune,'' NASA said. ``Voyager's
photographs of the rings arcs are the first photographic evidence
that such a ring system exists.''
   The three to six previously suspected ring arcs were detected by
telescopes on Earth as Neptune passed in front of a distant star.
   Saturn's extensive rings are made mostly of marble-sized ice
pebbles, while Uranus' rings contain very dark boulders of unknown
composition, Smith said. Jupiter is encircled by a single thin ring
and a sheet of fine dust, while Saturn has some ring arcs in
addition to its rings, Terrile said
   Why does Neptune have partial rather than complete rings?
   ``That's the $64,000 question,'' Terrile said. ``Rings come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, all the way from complete disks of
material like we've seen at Saturn, to narrow thin complete
ringlets like we've seen at Uranus. ... We believe the
gravitational influence of moons that orbit nearby give rings their
particular form.''
   Voyager 2 detected the 30,000-mile-long arc just outside the
orbit of one of the newly discovered moons, designated 1989 N4,
which orbits about 23,300 miles above Neptune. The 6,000-mile long
arc seems to trail about 50,000 miles behind moon 1989 N3, which
orbits about 17,000 miles above Neptune's cloudtops, NASA said.

   Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands
of dust orbiting Neptune and found evidence the planet has
``southern lights,'' NASA said today.
   The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of Triton, the
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited
scientists as unique in the solar system, NASA said.
   ``There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said NASA astronomer Rich
Terrile, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands
orbit Neptune's equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered
by Voyager earlier.
   Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with Neptune
and Triton, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken
during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers
celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby.
   ``My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had
one hell of a party last night,'' Mike Urban, a Voyager engineer,
said today.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m. PDT Friday.
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons
besides Triton and Nereid, which were first observed from Earth. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be
a complete ring.
   While only the narrow rings were visible as Voyager flew toward
Neptune, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, Terrile said.
That makes them look like Saturn's broad rings, but only when viewed
from behind Neptune.
   The same thing happened when Voyager passed Uranus in 1986. That
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft,
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus.
Terrile said Neptune's dust bands are not as extensive.
   Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at
30 degrees south latitude on Neptune as Voyager's ultraviolet light
sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project
scientist Ellis Miner said today.
   Because the scan didn't cover different longitudes, scientists
don't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles Neptune
east to west, as do Earth's auroras, Miner said.
   Miner said Voyager also found nitrogen in Triton's atmosphere.
Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth's atmosphere.
   On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles,
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates
magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on
Earth to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On
Earth they glow in visible light. Neptune's lights glow ultraviolet
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere.
   Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape
recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during
the Neptune and Triton rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, Urban said.
   Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of
Triton, which is four-fifth's the size of Earth's moon. But pictures
returned Friday were more than enough to stun scientists.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
Carl Sagan said Friday. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The photographs show a cracked, frozen Triton scarred by
thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters,
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far
defy explanation.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist Edward Stone said
Friday at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some
other moons, but Triton is the first place scientists have actually
seen ice volcanoes, Stone said. Photographs showed at least three
inactive volcanoes.
   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000
to 2,000 feet high.
   The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen
``are very different from ordinary ice,'' said Sagan, a member of
the Voyager imaging team. ``That may explain the exoticness of the
landforms.''
   Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment
of radiation that produced chemical changes, Sagan said. ``We've got
pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.''
   Preliminary measurements of Triton's magnetic field suggest that
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like Earth's magnetic
field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said.
   Robert Strom of the Voyager imaging team said the relative
scarcity of craters on Triton tends to confirm speculation that
Triton originated outside the solar system and became captured by
Neptune's gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons.
   Voyager also revealed that Triton has an atmosphere and is
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog.
   On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other
volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and
condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look
back at Neptune. Then it will head toward interstellar space.
   Weary NASA scientists, many of whom spent all night at the
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over
the spectacular images being received.
   Laurence Soderblom of the Voyager imaging team said: ``Wow! What
a way to leave the solar system.''

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its 1995 encounter with Jupiter.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a NASA was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager Dick Spehalski said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
9:59 p.m. PST Friday. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager Bill O'Neil.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents Galileo from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of Venus, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, Johnson said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of Venus' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, Johnson said.
   The pictures and data were stored on Galileo's tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to Earth until October when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past Earth
on Dec. 8.
   The $1.35 billion mission also will let Galileo examine Earth,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995,
they arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above Venus' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on Earth.
   Ausman said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to Jupiter,''
Johnson said.
   Galileo will use the Earth as a gravity slingshot next December
and again Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward
Jupiter, Ausman said.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar map at
least 70 percent of Venus' surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result of
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo toward
Jupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block Galileo's mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate Florida
with plutonium in Galileo's nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
NASA said the risk was minimal.

   NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to
launch ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft'' from a space shuttle Oct.
12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a
probe into the giant planet's atmosphere.
   During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see
parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first
close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said.
   The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to
higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least
expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.
   When it passes Earth, Galileo will observe gases that cause
``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, study depletion
of Earth's protective ozone layer, and make detailed observations of
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the
early 1960s are available, said Torrence Johnson, the project
scientist.
   ``The Galileo spacecraft is a marvel,'' Neal Ausman Jr., the
mission director, said during a news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboraory. ``It is the most complex spacecraft we've ever
flown at JPL _ probably the most complex spacecraft ever.''
   Clayne Yeates, acting science and mission design manager, called
Galileo the ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft,'' with an array of
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and
scientific data on Jupiter and its moons than could be obtained by
the twin Voyager spacecraft.
   Among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow
researchers to take a picture every two-and-one-third seconds. The
television cameras on Voyager 2 can take a picture only once every
50 or 60 seconds, said Yeates.
   Voyager 2 is flying past the planet Neptune this week, the climax
of its 12-year, 4.4-billion trek past four planets. It explored
Jupiter in 1979.
   Galileo will drop a probe by parachute into the Jovian atmosphere
to make detailed observations. Jupiter's atmosphere is covered with
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets
underneath.
   Researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10,000 to
100,000 times as strong as those seen on Earth. Galileo will pass
600 miles from the Jovian moon Io, which has the most active
volcanoes in the solar system.
   The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to carry Galileo into Earth
orbit Oct. 12, then launch the spacecraft. Galileo will be boosted
into a trajectory that will take it looping around Venus, where it
will study the planet's atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm
the existence of lightning there.
   Galileo then will swing back past Earth in December 1990, using
Earth's gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed.
   Its next stop will be the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars,
where in October 1991 it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid
Gaspra, a typical asteroid about 10 miles long.
   ``We don't have any pictures of asteroids,'' said Johnson.
``Nobody's been by one.''
   The spacecraft then will swing past Earth again before being sent
on its way to Jupiter. It may have a second opportunity to pass by
an asteroid in August 1993.
   Galileo will make about 10 orbits around Jupiter, passing closest
to Io but also near Europa and Ganymede, two other Jovian moons.
   The Galileo mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began
in 1977, at which time launch was set for 1982. Budget cuts during
the Reagan administration, design changes and the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay, said John
Casani, former project manager and now in charge of all flight
projects at JPL.

   Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny
``moonlets'' hidden in one of Neptune's two brightest rings, and
also found three more rings orbiting the planet, NASA said Saturday.
   Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's
fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a
tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like Earth's northern
and southern lights.
   The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up 78 percent
of Earth's atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of
Triton, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink
snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed
viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is
present as well, they said.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Sunday, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from
Neptune, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will
be 2.75 billion miles from Earth. Voyager traveled a curving
4.43-billion-mile path to achieve Thursday night's close encounter
with Neptune and Friday morning's flight past Triton.
   ``We have five rings at Neptune,'' including the two bright ones
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said Bradford
Smith, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Smith said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't
well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as
five. He reversed himself later Saturday, deciding the rings are
distinct enough to count the total as five.
   A bright ring discovered Aug. 11 initially appeared to be a
partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring.
Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12
miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, Smith said.
   ``You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said.
   Smith said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring
has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others.
   So far, Voyager has discovered six objects orbiting Neptune that
are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight
moons, including Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth.
   The ring containing the moonlets remains Neptune's outermost
ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring,
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse
band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest
to Neptune is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band
of dust NASA said was 1,550 miles wide.
   The initial confusion over the number of Neptune's rings is
reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in 1986. Ten thin rings were
apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed
that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible
when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing
how many distinct rings orbit Uranus.
   Researchers said Saturday that Voyager also found:
   _Neptune's magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away
from the poles around which the planet rotates. Earth's magnetic
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one
magnetic pole in northern Canada about 1,000 miles from the true, or
rotational, north pole.
   _The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than
the Van Allen belts encircling Earth. The radiation belt's location
near the orbit of Triton may explain the pinkish hue of some of the
moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas
that color.
   Deputy Voyager project scientist Ellis Miner said there is
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south
latitude, Neptune has an aurora similar to Earth's northern and
southern lights. Other scientists Saturday refused to discuss the
evidence, saying it was too preliminary.
   If the aurora proves real, Neptune's tilted magnetic field would
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's
equator rather than the rotational poles.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth,
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational
poles are relatively close.
   Voyager continued Saturday to send back recorded photographs
taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed
photos of Triton.
   The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global
temperature map of Neptune, search for auroras and more rings, and
study the weight of Neptune and Triton.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look
back at Neptune. Then it will head toward interstellar space,
looking for the edge of the solar system.

   Hughes Aircraft Co. will ship its
rebuilt $157 million Galileo space probe to NASA on Wednesday so a
space shuttle can launch the probe and a mother ship toward Jupiter
in October.
   The $1.36 billion, six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage was delayed
3{ years by the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL (NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) on its way to Jupiter,''
Hughes vice president Steven Dorfman said at a news conference
Tuesday.
   Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said the 4-foot-diameter,
teardrop-shaped probe would be trucked Wednesday across the Los
Angeles area to Pasadena, where JPL runs America's unmanned space
exploration program for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the Kennedy
Space Center in April, followed the next month by the mother ship,
or Galileo orbiter. After the two are attached, the combined
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed
aboard the shuttle Atlantis.
   The launch is expected to take place between Oct. 12 and about
Nov. 21.
   After exploring two asteroids, the orbiter and probe will reach
Jupiter in December 1995, after separating 150 days earlier. The
probe will enter Jupiter's atmosphere at 115,000 mph, then deploy a
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planet's
atmosphere.
   The probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes
before it is crushed by Jupiter's tremendous atmospheric pressure.
   The orbiter will circle Jupiter for at least 20 months, studying
the planet and its surrounding moons, magnetic field and
electrically charged particles.
   The data will help scientists better understand the origin of
Jupiter, the solar system and the universe, said Richard Young,
Galileo probe project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View.
   Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in
May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet and
the fifth from the sun.
   Then Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986, killing seven crew
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last fall. After the
tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid-fueled
Centaurs aboard the shuttle.
   Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and
lengthened because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as
ideally as they were in 1986 and because the new booster is less
powerful.
   Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were
retested.
   On the new flight plan, Galileo will take six years instead of
three years to get to the gaseous, giant planet, traveling 2.4
billion miles although Jupiter is about 400 million miles from
Earth, Dore said. To gain energy for the trip, Galileo will use the
gravity of Venus and Earth in a slingshot effect.
   Galileo will swing toward Venus in February 1990, swing back
toward Earth that December, circle the sun, and swing around Earth
again in December 1992 before finally heading for Jupiter.
   The delay increased the probe's cost to $157 million from $133
million, said Benny Chin, Galileo probe project manager at
NASA-Ames. Total cost of the mission, from its official start in
1977 through completion in late 1997 is about $1.36 billion, said
Richard Spehalski, Galileo project manager at JPL.
   Spehalski said White House approval for the launch is expected in
September. Such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive
plutonium. A NASA environmental impact statement concluded last
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off
with Galileo is very small.

   NASA starts the countdown Monday,
but Thursday's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis depends on
whether a federal judge permits its five astronauts to dispatch the
nuclear-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.
   Anti-nuclear activists have sued to halt the flight, arguing
that a launch accident could spread radioactive plutonium over
densely populated parts of Florida. The space agency maintains the
danger is almost non-existent.
   Both sides will argue their cases in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Judge Oliver Gasch then will
decide whether to grant a temporary restraining order to stop the
launch, or to let the countdown proceed. This is the first time
anyone has gone to court to stop a NASA launch.
   The plutonium argument overshadows the fact that the mission
involves the most expensive, most sophisticated unmanned space
probe ever built, a vehicle one mission official calls ``the
Rolls-Royce of spacecraft.''
   After a six-year outward journey, Galileo, priced at $1.4
billion, is to shoot a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere and then
orbit the planet for two years.
   Mission planners say its investigation of Jupiter and its moons
will be the most scientifically rich that interplanetary
exploration has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager views of Jupiter and
its satellites were fascinating, but Galileo's images will be 1,000
times clearer, they say.
   The countdown is to start at 8 a.m. Monday. If Gasch does not
rule quickly, the count will pause at the 11-hour mark, for several
days if necessary, awaiting a decision. Several critical steps,
including fueling the shuttle, occur after that point.
   If Gasch gives the green light, and no other problems arise,
Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at 1:29 p.m. Thursday.
   The activists vow that if they lose in court, they will
physically try to stop the liftoff.
   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on
the launch pad,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the Florida
Coalition of Peace and Justice, one of three groups that filed the
suit.
   Extra security measures have been in force several days,
including closing to the public several roads approaching Kennedy
Space Center. These roads are normally closed only on launch days.
   NASA officials are concerned that Thursday's brief, 10-minute
launch window would vanish if protesters penetrate the launch zone
with a boat or plane in the count's final minutes.
   At issue are Galileo's two generators and their fuel: 48 pounds
of radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide.
   The activists say that if the space shuttle crashed or exploded,
as the Challenger did in 1986, the poisonous plutonium would be
released into the air.
   NASA has said the ``highest probability of launch-area release
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 and
such a release would have no appreciable adverse effects on the
population.''
   The agency quotes health physicists who say this type of
plutonium is relatively harmless unless a particle is inhaled or
lodges in an open wound, where it could cause cancer. Generally the
particles do not travel far in air and can be stopped by a piece of
paper or unbroken human skin.
   In tests, empty graphite plutonium containers have been blown
up, shot at and burned to determine how they survive all types of
accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those
generated by the Challenger explosion, say NASA and the Energy
Department, which took part in the testing.
   The space agency notes that similar generators have flown on 22
space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and
that in three instances the well-protected devices survived severe
accidents: two unmanned rockets that blew up in the 1960s and the
explosion aboard Apollo 13 in 1970, which forced abandonment of a
moon landing.
   Plutonium 238's normal decay gives off intense heat, which
Galileo will convert to electricity. No other power source is
practical for space missions too far from the sun to use solar
energy.
   The five astronauts who will fly the mission say they are not
concerned about flying with plutonium.
   ``I have no absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said
commander Donald Williams.
   Pilot Mike McCulley was more blunt: ``I don't see how it can
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's pretty
remote. I think it is a complete non-issue except as a
philosophical issue to some people.''
   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as
well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about
it; I feel it's safe,'' said mission specialist Ellen Baker.
   The other crew members, mission specialists Shannon Lucid and
Franklin Chang-Diaz, expressed similar feelings.
   Six hours after liftoff, the astronauts are to release Galileo
from the cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motor will start the
6,700-pound craft on a six-year trip that will cover 2.4 billion
miles on the path to Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar
system.
   Along the way, Galileo will obtain fly-by data about the moon,
Venus and at least one asteroid, Gaspra. It will make two return
swings to within 600 miles of Earth.
   In December 1995 a 737-pound probe released from the spacecraft
is to plunge into Jupiter's cloud layers at 115,000 mph and make
the first direct sampling of the Jovian atmosphere. Slowed quickly
by the thickening atmosphere, the probe will pop a parachute and
transmit data to the Galileo mother ship for about an hour as it
descends about 360 miles before it is crushed and vaporized by
extreme heat and pressure.
   Galileo will fire into orbit about the planet, and its 10
scientific instruments will gather information on temperatures,
magnetic fields, radiation, cloud characteristics and gravity
fields.
   Of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather system
that produce the ever-changing bands, whirls and plumes seen from
Earth and from the two Voyager spacecraft.
   The weather includes storms up to 25,000 miles across that have
raged for centuries. Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot,
which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm
similar to Earth's hurricanes.
   The Voyagers also found that Jupiter, 318 times more massive
than Earth, is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen, topped by
an atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium. They discovered a
narrow ring of debris around the planet and found three new moons,
raising the toal to 16.
   The four largest moons bear the same relationship to their
planet as planets in our solar system do to the sun _ the nearest
being solid rock, like Mercury, and the farthest being a slush ball
with a rock in the center, like gaseous Neptune.
   Thus, Galileo will examine data and transmit pictures of a
miniature solar system as it orbits Jupiter, said Edward C. Stone,
professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, who
is one of the mission scientists.
   ``Galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing, as
the Voyagers did,'' Stone said. ``Being there and observing over a
period of nearly two years will allow us to sort out the dynamics
of Jupiter and its moons.''

   The spacecraft Galileo grabbed Earth's
gravity coattails Saturday and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to Jupiter.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, Galileo used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
Atlantic, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at 12:35 p.m. PST, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the Earth, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director Neal E. Ausman Jr. at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through Earth's shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the Jupiter encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager William J. O'Neil added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   Galileo's looping 2.4 billion-mile route to Jupiter made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered Galileo's instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from Earth, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from Earth's dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
Australia. Data and pictures will continue to come in as Galileo
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle Columbia.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to Galileo's $1.4 billion mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to Jupiter for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986
led to changes in Galileo's own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried Galileo into orbit Oct. 18, 1989, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from Venus and Earth.
   The spacecraft flew past Venus on Feb. 10. It will get another
boost from Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept Jupiter.
   Galileo will go into orbit around Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   A probe launched from Galileo five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore Jupiter and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   Images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft
revealed three previously unknown moons circling Neptune,
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced today.
   The discoveries, in addition to a moon spotted by Voyager 2 last
month, bring to six the number of satellites known to be orbiting
the blue planet, laboratory officials said.
   Voyager was more than 22 million miles from Neptune when the
moons were confirmed by scientists Wednesday, indicating there may
be many more discoveries as the space probe draws even closer in
coming weeks.
   The newly discovered moons were temporarily named 1989 N2, 1989
N3 and 1989 N4. The objects were tracked as ``candidate moons'' for
five days and then confirmed when they followed predicted orbits.
   The moons appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in
diameter and are in circular, equatorial orbits moving in the
direction of the planet's rotation. Neptune's big moon, Triton,
moves in the opposite direction.
   The moon 1989 N3 is closest to the planet, orbiting 17,000 miles
above Neptune's cloud tops and completing one orbit every 8 hour
and 10 minutes.
   Orbiting 23,000 miles above the clouds, 1989 N4 circles Neptune
in 10 hours and 20 minutes.
   The farthest out of the three, 1989 N2 is 30,000 miles above the
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes.
   Voyager 2 is on a course that will take it within 3,000 miles of
Neptune on Aug. 24. The spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has
been past Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. It is more than 2.7 billion
miles from Earth.

exploring the solar system.

   Pioneer 11, the first spacecraft to visit
Saturn, flew beyond the orbit of Neptune on Friday and became the
fourth human-made craft to exit the solar system, NASA and the
probe's builder said.
   ``We wish it a fond farewell,'' said Montye Male, a spokeswoman
for TRW Inc., which built Pioneer 11 at its Space &amp; Technology
Group facility in Redondo Beach.
   Neptune is now the outermost planet. Pluto currently is closer
to the sun in an elongated, elliptical orbit, part of which is
beyond Neptune's path.
   By crossing Neptune's orbit Friday at a distance of 2.8 billion
miles from Earth, Pioneer 11 followed Pioneer 10 and Voyagers 1 and
2 out of the solar system, said Peter Waller, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View.
   Both officials acknowledged that some don't consider the orbit
of the outermost planet to be the edge of the solar system. Some
scientists consider the true edge to be the heliopause, where solar
wind yields to interstellar wind an estimated 5 billion to 14
billion miles from the sun.
   A few even consider the solar system to end at the Oort Cloud, a
theorized but yet-unseen spherical cloud of comets that may be
located about 7 trillion to 14 trillion miles from the sun.
   Waller said NASA considers the Pioneers and Voyagers to be
outside the solar system because _ to use a seafaring analogy _
``once you've left land behind, you don't worry about coastal
waters.''
   Pioneer 11 was launched April 5, 1973, and visited Jupiter on
Dec. 2, 1974, a year after Pioneer 10 flew past the solar system's
largest planet. Pioneer 11 whizzed by Jupiter at 107,373 mph, which
Waller said was the fastest speed ever traveled by a spacecraft.
   It passed only 26,600 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops _ much
closer than the Voyager 1 and 2 flybys in 1979 _ and was bombarded
by the planet's intense radiation belts.
   On Sept. 1, 1979, it became the first spacecraft to explore
Saturn, visiting the ringed planet 14 months ahead of Voyager 1 and
two years ahead of Voyager 2. Pioneer 10 didn't fly past Saturn.
   Waller said in a telephone interview that Pioneer 11 flew about
13,000 miles from Saturn, taking the first closeup pictures of that
planet, discovering two small moonlets and a ring, and collecting
data that scientists used to determine that the major moon, Titan,
was too cold for life despite the presence of organic chemicals.
   Although Pioneer 11 was launched four years before the Voyagers,
it took longer to fly beyond the outermost planet's orbit because
it is traveling through space in the same direction as the sun and
the rest of the solar system, Male said.
   In June 1983, Pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to pass
beyond the planets. It is now 4.5 billion miles from Earth, Male
said.
   In three years, it will become difficult to simultaneously
operate Pioneer 11's radio transmitter and scientific instruments,
although engineers may be able to get the spacecraft to send back
data on solar wind until 1995, project manager Richard Fimmel said.
   Pioneer 10, with a stronger power supply, may return information
through the year 2000.

<TEXT>
   A space probe grounded for 3{ years by
the Challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an October launch to
Jupiter, where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the
birth of the solar system.
   The $1.36 billion Galileo mission should climax in December 1995,
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75
minutes before it is crushed by Jupiter's intense atmospheric
pressure.
   Its mother ship, the Galileo orbiter, will circle the planet for
22 months.
   Hughes Aircraft Co. planned to deliver the refurbished $157
million Galileo probe late this afternoon in Pasadena, where NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL on its way to Jupiter,'' Hughes Vice President Steven Dorfman
said at a news conference Tuesday.
   JPL will send the 4-foot-diameter, teardrop-shaped probe to
Kennedy Space Center in Florida in late April, followed by the
orbiter in mid-May. The probe and orbiter then will be hooked up
together, placed atop a booster rocket, and finally loaded into the
cargo bay of the shuttle Atlantis.
   The shuttle, set for launch no earlier than Oct. 12 and no later
than about Nov. 21, will release the combined Galileo spacecraft
into Earth orbit. Then Galileo's rocket will fire, sending the
orbiter and probe on a circuitous, 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage
to the solar system's largest planet, which is the fifth planet from
the sun and is about 400 million miles from Earth.
   En route to the giant gaseous planet, Galileo will observe two
asteroids. The probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they
reach Jupiter, then fly in tandem until the probe enters the
atmosphere at 115,000 mph. The probe will deploy a parachute and
descend about 370 miles through Jovian skies until it is crushed by
pressure more than 25 times Earth's atmosphere.
   Data from the probe will help scientists better understand the
origin of Jupiter, the solar system and the universe, said Richard
Young, Galileo probe project scientist at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
   Scientists believe the Jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the
original material from which stars are formed, according to a Hughes
statement.
   The orbiter will measure Jupiter's electrical particle and
magnetic fields, and snap 50,000 photographs of the planet and its
moons, including Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, which were
discovered in 1610 by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.
   The spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle
in May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to Jupiter. But Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986, killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet
until last fall.
   After the tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. Galileo's route to
Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years
to six because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as
they were in 1986 and because Galileo's new solid-fueled booster is
less powerful.
   The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging.
   White House approval for the launch is expected in September,
said Richard Spehalski, Galileo project manager at JPL. Such
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium. A NASA
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with Galileo is very
small.

   Here are key events for the Galileo
spacecraft's looping, six-year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's
largest planet:
   Oct. 18, 1989 _ Galileo is released from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then an Inertial Upper Stage booster launches the
spacecraft on its long voyage.
   Nov. 9-11, 1989 _ Controllers order multiple firings of
Galileo's thrusters for the first of about 30 course correction
maneuvers.
   Dec. 22, 1989 _ Thrusters fire again for second course
correction.
   Feb. 9, 1990 _ Galileo swoops near Venus for its first ``gravity
assist'' maneuver, using the planet's gravity to increase the
spacecraft's speed to help it reach Jupiter. Galileo makes photos
and measurements of Venus, storing them on an onboard recorder.
   Late October 1990 _ Galileo plays back to Earth the photos and
measurements it made near Venus.
   Dec. 8, 1990 _ Galileo passes within 600 miles of Earth, making
photos and measurements during its second ``gravity assist''
maneuver, which will help aim it toward Jupiter.
   Oct. 29, 1991 _ The spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of
asteroid Gaspra, taking pictures and measurements.
   Dec. 8, 1992 _ Galileo zooms about 185 miles above Earth's
surface in the third and final ``gravity assist'' maneuver needed
to hurl it toward Jupiter.
   Aug. 28, 1993 _ If Galileo has adequate propellant supplies, it
passes 600 miles from asteroid Ida for photos and measurements.
   July 1995 _ The spacecraft separates into a 760-pound Galileo
probe and a 4,890-pound Galileo orbiter. Both continue toward
Jupiter.
   Dec. 7, 1995 _ The probe and orbiter arrive at Jupiter. The
probe plunges into the planet's atmosphere, relaying measurements
to the orbiter, then is destroyed by intense atmospheric pressure.
The orbiter speeds about 600 miles from the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers, then goes into orbit around
Jupiter.
   December 1995-October 1997 _ The orbiter circles Jupiter, making
photos and measurements of the giant planet and the moons Europa,
Ganymede and Callisto.

   The Galileo space ship cruised on the
next leg of its 2.4-billion mile, six-year trip to Jupiter after
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act
like a mad shutterbug.
   Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on Saturday, but for
about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera
opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None
of those unintended exposures were recorded.
   NASA engineers sent the 2.8-ton Galileo new computer commands
late Saturday, and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures, right
on schedule, of cloud-shrouded Venus in a series that ended Sunday
morning.
   ``They seem to understand what happened, and they're not
concerned about any repeats,'' said Bob MacMillin, spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Galileo is now flying back toward Earth so the planet can act as
a gravity slingshot on Dec. 8 to help the spacecraft reach Jupiter
in 1995 in a $1.35 billion mission to explore the solar system's
largest planet.
   Galileo swooped about 10,000 miles above the 900-degree
Fahrenheit surface of Venus at 9:59 p.m. PST Friday in the
mission's first ``gravity assist maneuver.'' Venus helped increase
Galileo's speed by almost 5,000 mph, giving it enough energy to get
to Jupiter.
   After the flyby, the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study
Venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning. The camera
bugs then developed.
   MacMillin said engineers determined Galileo's camera and
computer were fine, and that the problem was in a computer program
sent from Earth to tell Galileo what to do and when to do it.
   The problem was caused by improper timing between various
commands within the computer program, MacMillin said.
   He said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as
Galileo. The craft was deployed Oct. 18 from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then launched by a solid-fueled booster to start
its looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year trip to Jupiter.
   The spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at Venus
until late this Friday, taking 27 more photos and using other
sensors to detect dust, infrared and visible light, and
electrically charged particles.
   The pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecraft's
tape recorder. Almost all of them will be sent back to Earth in
October when Galileo is close enough to send scientific information
using its small antenna.
   That antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft. A
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the sun's heat.
   After swinging past Earth in December, Galileo will explore
asteroid Gaspra in October 1991, then make another flight past
Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. The spacecraft may study asteroid Ida in
August 1993 before Galileo deploys a 760-pound probe in July 1995.
Galileo and the probe will reach Jupiter in December 1995.
   The probe will parachute into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to Galileo until it is vaporized by intense heat and
pressure. Galileo will swoop past the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes, then go into orbit around Jupiter to
study the planet and moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede at least
until late 1997.

The shuttle Atlantis roared into space Wednesday on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the 9:53 a.m. PDT launching and is 
finally on its way to Jupiter. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the Galileo and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director Robert Sieck said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth the wait," said Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center in 
Mountain View, Calif., one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for Galileo to reach Jupiter, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of Earth as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, NASA officials considered scrapping the $1.4-billion project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as NASA reevaluated the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to Jupiter. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, NASA decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving Galileo with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was saved when engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to Jupiter without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push Galileo 
beyond Earth's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give Galileo the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so Galileo will have to take the scenic back 
roads to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
After Galileo was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced speed left Galileo falling toward the sun. But, in February, 
Galileo will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing Galileo around and throw it back toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1990, Galileo will come within 600 miles of Earth, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using Earth's gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of Earth's orbit. Ten months later, 
Galileo is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1992, Galileo will make a daringly close approach to Earth, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, that should give Galileo the speed it will need to reach 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if Galileo accidentally plunges down 
into Earth's atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
That would require multiple failures, which NASA judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for NASA, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt Wednesday's launching. 
</P>
<P>
Although Galileo will send data back to Earth during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters Jupiter. Galileo will loop 
around Jupiter and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before Galileo reaches Jupiter, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data 
until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California 
on Monday at 12:39 p.m. The shuttle's pilot is Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley. 
Other members of the crew are Shannon W. Lucid, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Ellen 
S. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RETURN TO JUPITER 
</P>
<P>
After a flight lasting six years, the Galileo probe will separate into two 
parts as it approaches Jupiter. The orbiter section will circle the planet for 
at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere 
and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases 
there. 
</P>
<P>
GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to 
Jupiter. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight 
path using flybys of the planets Venus and Earth to build up enough speed to 
reach Jupiter.

<HEAD>Voyager 1 Appears Successful in Snapping Family Portrait of
Planets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 1 spacecraft sent radio
signals to Earth today indicating it successfully snapped pictures
of most of the planets to create the first family portrait of the
solar system, NASA said.
   ``Engineering data we received show the proper commands were
executed. It looks like the pictures were taken properly,'' said
Mary Hardin, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Voyager 1, which photographed Jupiter in 1980 and Saturn in
1981, was ordered to snap the photographs between 5:12 p.m. and
9:20 p.m. PST Tuesday, but it took five hours and 36 minutes for
signals confirming the commands were executed to travel the 3.7
billion miles to Earth, Hardin said.
   The space probe took the pictures from a vantage point 32
degrees above the plane extending from the sun's equator. The
planets orbit the sun roughly within that plane.
   Because no other spacecraft has been in such a position or will
be there within coming decades, ``this is probably the first time
and last time in our lifetimes we'll be able to take such a
picture,'' Hardin said. ``It's historic. It will give us a
perspective on our world and universe we've never had before.''
   NASA officials have said that when the photographs are assembled
into a montage for display on a wall, the planets will appear only
as tiny dots separated by vast empty spaces and spreading ovr 100
feet or more.
   Instructions to take the pictures were transmitted to the
spacecraft's computer on Jan. 15, with more detailed orders issued
Feb. 2.
   Because of other demands on NASA Deep Space Tracking Antennas,
the photos won't be sent back to Earth until late March. It will be
late April before the images can be processed.
   The sun and seven of the solar system's nine planets are
expected to appear as points of light against a starry backdrop,
JPL officials said.
   Mercury, the innermost planet, will be too close to the sun to
be distinguished by Voyager's cameras and Pluto is too far away and
too small to show up in images.

   Seven months into its six-year, $1.35
billion journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft ignited its
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near Earth in December,
NASA said.
   The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two-day
maneuver that ends late today, said Jim Wilson, a spokesman at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth
flyby. It's a very gradual change,'' mission director Neal Ausman
said Friday.
   On Dec. 8, Galileo will swoop past Earth in a gravity slingshot
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the
sun and hurl it toward its 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the solar
system's largest planet.
   The spacecraft will study Earth during the flyby and again
during another slingshot maneuver in December 1992. Galileo used
Venus as a gravity slingshot Feb. 9.
   When the maneuver started at 11:10 a.m. PDT Friday, Galileo was
96 million miles from Earth, but had traveled a looping path of 365
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle Atlantis
last Oct. 18, Wilson said.
   Its trip to Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, will total
2.4 billion miles.
   The $1.35 billion mission will take Galileo past one asteroid in
1991 and perhaps another in 1993. In July 1995, the spacecraft
separates into a 4,890-pound orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They
are scheduled to reach Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense
atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two years
studying and taking snapshots of Jupiter and its major moons Io,
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
   One or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get Galileo
to swoop about 1,000 miles from Earth in December, Ausman said.
Without the maneuvers, the spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5
million miles.

<HEAD>Probe to Pluto Could Be Piggybacked on Solar Mission, NASA Engineer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA engineer has proposed a relatively
quick, cheap way to send a spacecraft to Pluto, the only unexplored
planet in the solar system.
   Robert Farquhar, who manages the small missions program at NASA
headquarters in Washington, said a rocket designed to send a probe
to the sun also could hurl an unmanned spaceship to Pluto.
   ``It's a free ride,'' he said in an interview in Tuesday's Los
Angeles Times.
   Voyager 2's flight past Neptune last week leaves Pluto the only
planet unvisited by a spacecraft from Earth. There are no plans for
a Pluto mission, and such a flight won't be financially feasible for
decades, officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration have said.
   Farquhar, who masterminded the flight of the first spacecraft to
visit a comet, said his proposal would allow a probe to be launched
toward Pluto within about a dozen years and for less than $150
million. That's cheap compared with the twin-spacecraft Voyager
mission that visited four planets for $865 million.
   NASA plans to send a probe through the sun's searing atmosphere
right after the turn of the century.
   To approach the sun at an angle that would allow scientists to
monitor the probe throughout its flight, it first would have to be
carried around Jupiter.
   Farquhar said a lightweight Pluto probe could be carried on the
same Titan rocket. Once they reach Jupiter, the probes would part
for their respective targets. The Pluto probe, given a boost by
Jupiter's gravity, would reach Pluto around 2014.
   Pluto normally is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun.
But Neptune now is temporarily in that position because of Pluto's
elongated elliptical orbit.
   Farquhar's proposal is ``a very interesting possibility,'' said
physicist Bruce Tsurutani of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, who is planning the solar probe. Tsurutani said Farquhar's
proposal should receive strong consideration.
   Physicist Alan Stern, a University of Colorado expert on Pluto,
said the proposal is feasible. He suggested that any joint
solar-Pluto mission be named ``Fire and Ice.''
   If Farquhar's proposal is accepted, it won't be the first time
one of his ideas gains favor. Farquhar and the late Fred Scarf, a
physicist with TRW Inc. in Redondo Beach, persuaded NASA a few years
ago to redirect an aging spacecraft toward comet Giacobini-Zinner.
   The International Sun-Explorer 3, which had finished its main
mission of studying the solar wind, was renamed the International
Cometary Explorer and became the first to visit a comet. The probe
arrived at Giacobini-Zinner in 1985, just before five European and
Japanese spacecraft visited Halley's comet in 1986,
   Farquhar said he devised his Pluto proposal while examining plans
for the solar probe. NASA has made that probe a high-priority
mission because the sun has been relatively neglected in space
exploration.
   Under Farquhar's proposal, the Pluto probe would contain a
camera, a dust counter, an instrument to study the planet's
atmosphere and radio gear for communication and other studies. The
spacecraft also might send a package of instruments to Pluto's
surface as it darted past the planet.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Finds Giant `Dark Spot' On Neptune; May Be Huge Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a
6,200-mile-wide dark spot on Neptune, and scientists believe it's a
giant storm similar to Earth's hurricanes and Jupiter's Great Red
Spot.
   The width is about one-fifth of Neptune's 30,700-mile diameter,
just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the
size of Jupiter, said Andrew Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the
California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager 2 was launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977, visited
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its twin,
Voyager 1, explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and is now
heading toward interplanetary space.
   ``I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter
because Uranus was such a bland place,'' Ingersoll said Monday. ``So
I'm happy to see such action on Neptune.''
   The top Voyager scientist was similarly excited.
   ``It's huge!'' Caltech physicist and vice president Edward Stone
said of the dark spot.
   While the robot probe is too far from Neptune to detect winds
within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane-like storm system
similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said Stone,
chief scientist of the Voyager project for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   Hurricanes on Earth are much smaller, measuring several hundred
miles across. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week
or two, Jupiter's Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since
its discovery more than 350 years ago _ a mystery scientists have
yet to explain.
   Stone said Neptune's dark spot became apparent in photographs
taken by Voyager's television cameras in April, and faint hints of
it can be seen in pictures made as early as January.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as Jupiter
and Neptune may explain the persistence of the spots, Ingersoll
said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth.
   Voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to Neptune, the
solar system's fourth-largest planet, at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   It will swoop 3,000 miles from the planet's north pole, by far
the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecraft's
``grand tour'' of the giant, gaseous outer planets. Five hours
later, it will pass 25,000 miles from Triton, one of two known
Neptunian moons.
   Voyager 2 today was 2.66 billion miles from Earth and 58.98
million miles from Neptune, speeding toward that planet at 42,216
mph, said Mary Beth Murrill, spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Neptune's dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the
planet's southern hemisphere, Ingersoll said.
   Voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white
spot _ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees
south latitude, he said.
   The dark spot's color isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, Ingersoll said. But Stone said it is darker than Neptune's
surrounding skies, which are blue-green because of methane in its
mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
   Jupiter's Great Red Spot is believed to get its color from
organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within
it, said Ingersoll.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, Jupiter contains dozens of smaller
storm systems, which appear as white spots. Saturn has similar
storms, although they are less visible, Stone said.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and Neptune's dark spot, the scientists
said.
   The existence of Neptune's dark spot is mysterious because
scientists didn't think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce
winds, said Ingersoll. Unlike Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, Uranus
lacks enough internal heat to create big storms, Stone said.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, and is about
30 times farther from the sun than Earth. But because Pluto's
elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun,
Neptune will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until
the year 2007.

   The Voyager 2 spacecraft, flying through
space 2.6 billion miles from Earth, fired its thrusters Friday to
change course for its August 1989 picture-taking encounter with the
planet Neptune, NASA said.
   ``Responding to radio signals radioed from Earth, Voyager 2 fired
its hydrazine thrusters for three minutes and 29 seconds beginning
at 6:55 a.m. PST,'' said a statement issued by the space agency's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Flight engineering manager Lanny Miller said radio signals sent
to Earth by the space probe indicated the maneuver succeeded.
   The pre-planned course correction will bring Voyager 2 some 6,200
miles closer to the solar system's eighth planet, but another major
maneuver next April and several subsequent but minor trajectory
changes will be required before the Neptune flyby, said laboratory
spokeswoman Mary Beth Murrill.
   The spacecraft _ which passed by Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981
and Uranus in 1986 _ is scheduled to sweep within 3,000 miles of
Neptune's cloud tops at 9 p.m. PDT next Aug. 24, taking pictures
with its television camera.
   Five hours later, it will fly within 24,000 miles of Neptune's
moon Triton, which scientists believe may have lakes of liquid
nitrogen.
   Murrill said Voyager 2 is 414.7 million miles from Neptune, one
of the solar system's giant, gaseous outer planets.
   Radio commands to the probe and its response signals are
transmitted through large, dish-shaped radio antennae that make up
the Deep Space Network operated by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in Spain, Australia and Goldstone, Calif.
   Voyager 2 is so far away that the signals take four hours to
reach it, even traveling at the speed of light.
   The Neptune encounter will be the last of the so-called ``grand
tour'' of the outer planets by the Voyager probes. Voyagers 1 and 2
were launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in 1977. Voyager 1, which
visited Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, now is headed out of the
solar system.
   Scientists have called the Voyager mission humanity's most
productive space exploration effort because the two picture-taking
probes learned hundreds of times more about the outer planets than
all previous studies combined.
   NASA scientists have said that by 1995, when both probes are
searching for the edge of the solar system, the total cost of the
mission will be about $920 million, which is less than half what the
Pentagon spends during one workday.
   Among key Voyager discoveries were active volcanos spewing sulfur
on Jupiter's moon Io, an icy volcanism that produced glacier-like
flows on some of the Saturnian and Uranian moons, and the discovery
of at least 17 previously unknown moons: three at Jupiter, at least
four at Saturn and 10 orbiting Uranus.
   The probes also discovered new rings encircling Jupiter, Saturn
and Uranus; orange smog and ethane-methane rain on Saturn's moon
Titan, and dozens of giant hurricanes on Jupiter.

<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that
a magnetic field surrounds Neptune, suggesting the planet is
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like Earth's
northern lights, NASA announced Friday.
   Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to
determine the exact length of a day on Neptune, believed to be 17 to
18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of Neptune's
internal structure, said Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Just as Earth's magnetic field traps the Van Allen radiation
belts, Neptune's magnetic field also may help create radiation belts
around that planet. Scientists don't yet know if that poses a hazard
to Voyager 2's electronic components, Murrill said.
   Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from Earth and 5.92 million miles
from Neptune on Friday, speeding toward the giant gas planet at
42,236 mph.
   The spacecraft was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Voyager 2 will make its closest
approach to Neptune at 8:59 p.m. PDT on Thursday when it flies about
3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest
planet.
   Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition
to the two discovered from Earth, two partial rings, or ring arcs,
of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to
jet streams and giant cyclones on Earth.
   Discovery of Neptune's magnetic field was confirmed Friday by
intense, pulse-like radio emissions coming from the planet's
vicinity. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically
charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
field lines.
   ``Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have magnetic
fields, while Venus and Mars do not,'' the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said in a news release. ``Whether Pluto has one
or not is unknown.
   ``A planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines
that surround a planet,'' the agency said. ``Such fields are thought
to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. (Molten iron in
Earth's core, for example).''
   Certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along
magnetic field lines toward Earth's poles, creating the northern and
southern lights. A magnetic field at Neptune means that planet also
may have auroras, NASA said.
   Scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand
Neptune's internal structure. Voyager project scientist Edward Stone
has said he believes that Neptune's hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock
closer to the planet's center. That would mean that Neptune _ like
neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct sky-sea boundary.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planet's moons and rings
to turn them dark in color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause
similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs,
NASA said.
   The nature of Neptune's radio signal allowed scientists to
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field, not from
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere, said James Warwick, head
of Voyager's radio science team.
   ``The radio emissions are very intense, very impulsive and occur
in a limited range of frequency,'' Warwick, a scientist at Boulder,
Colo.-based Radiophysics Inc., said in the release.
   Once NASA confirmed the existence of Neptune's magnetic field
Friday, scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in
data collected by Voyager as early as Monday.
   ``Early analysis indicates Neptune's magnetic field is of an
intensity similar to the fields of Earth and Uranus,'' NASA said.
   Murrill said scientists don't yet know how Neptune's magnetic
field is aligned. Voyager found the axis of Uranus' magnetic field
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet
spins.
   Earth's north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the
planet's north rotational axis.

   The Galileo spacecraft, looping through
the solar system on the way to its 1995 exploration of Jupiter,
fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it
near Earth late this year.
   ``We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move
closer and closer to our aim point near Earth on Dec. 8,'' said
Neal Ausman, mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit
in the palm of a hand, started firing at 11:10 a.m. PDT and will
fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends Saturday
afternoon, laboratory spokesman Jim Wilson said.
   The two-day maneuver will slow the spacecraft, which was
traveling about 66,000 mph earlier today, by about 25 mph. It also
will gradually alter its direction, Ausman said.
   It is the second of three or four maneuvers needed to bring
Galileo within 1,000 miles of Earth, which will act as a gravity
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun and
propel it toward Jupiter, he added. Without maneuvers, the
spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5 million miles.
   As of today, Galileo was 96 million miles from Earth, but has
traveled a looping path of 365 million miles since it was launched
from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18. Its trip to Jupiter will
total 2.4 billion miles.
   Galileo will make a second swing past Earth in December 1992. It
flew past Venus in another gravity slingshot maneuver on Feb. 9.
   In July 1995, the spacecraft separates into a 4,890-pound
orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They are scheduled to reach Jupiter,
the solar system's largest planet, on Dec. 7, 1995.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter before the probe is destroyed by
intense atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two
years studying and taking snapshots of Jupiter and its major moons
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

   Neptune's icy volcanic moon Triton is the
coldest body ever measured in the solar system, NASA said Monday,
and the planet itself has something in common with Los Angeles: smog.
   The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like
Earth's northern lights on Neptune and Triton, scientists said.
   Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on Monday snapped a
series of family portraits of Neptune and Triton, appearing as
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.
   Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that
Triton's surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
making the moon ``the coldest body we have seen in the solar
system,'' said Roger Yelle of the University of Arizona.
   Scientists believe Pluto and its moon Charon are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   In another finding, the best close-up photo yet of another moon,
1989 N1, showed that Neptune's second-largest moon has a huge crater
about half as wide as the lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide satellite.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1,
one of six moons discovered since June by Voyager, according to
Bradford Smith, the leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find
liquid lakes or oceans on Triton, but the moon almost certainly is
too cold to have them, said Torrence Johnson, a scientist at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.
   Johnson defended the theory, advanced by other scientists Sunday,
that Triton has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles
20 miles skyward. ``It isn't a crazy idea,'' he said.
   Voyager's close encounter with Neptune occurred Thursday night
and it passed Triton on Friday, capping its epic tour of the four
outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The probe has also found five rings, including three thin ones
and two broad bands of dust.
   1989 N1 took Nereid's place as Neptune's second-largest moon
after Triton. N1 and the other five moons discovered by Voyager in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth,
have not yet been permanently named.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras somewhat like Earth's northern and southern lights
over wide sections of Neptune's skies and over much of Triton's day
side, said Yelle.
   But unlike Earth's auroras, which glow in visible light as
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases, the
auroras on Neptune and Triton are invisible to the human eye. That's
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles
excite hydrogen gas.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in Neptune's
atmosphere ``converts it into photochemical smog'' that forms a
90-mile-thick icy layer at the bottom of Neptune's stratosphere,
said Jim Pollock, an imaging team member from NASA's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, Calif.
   Smith said smog on Neptune and in Los Angeles have ``definite
similarities,'' although Los Angeles smog has components absent on
Neptune.
   Finding smog on Neptune ``is no surprise,'' Smith said.
``Photochemical smog exists any place (planet or moon) we've been
that has an atmosphere. In Los Angeles, the problem is it's
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts
exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' Saturn's smoggy
moon.
   Auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles
from the solar wind spiral toward a planet's magnetic poles along
magnetic field lines. On Earth, the magnetic poles are tilted only
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates, so
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions.
   Neptune's major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from
its rotational poles, and scientists have said the planet may have
multiple magnetic poles. That could explain why Neptune's auroras
appear over wide areas of the planet.
   Triton's aurora is created differently. Electrically charged
particles in Neptune's orbiting radiation belt, discovered recently
by Voyager, excite gases in Triton's atmosphere to create its
auroras, said Andy Chen of Johns Hopkins University.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Tuesday, Voyager will be 2.759 billion miles from
Earth and 4.097 million miles beyond Neptune, slowly decelerating as
it speeds toward the stars at 37,582 mph.
   NASA engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said Lanny Miller, manager of the flight
engineering office.

   Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft
that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years
after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the
launch pad, NASA scientists said Monday.
   Disturbances in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus suggest that a
mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond Pluto, John D. Anderson
of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said as NASA observed the fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past Pluto's orbit.
   Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is
searching for long gravity waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and
the boundary of the sun's influence.
   The radio signals the 570-pound space probe is sending back _
from 45 times the distance between the Earth and the sun _ aren't
very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light.
But they are important to researchers trying to solve some
classical puzzles about the universe.
   The energy of the craft's signals picked up by a 70-meter deep
space antenna would have to be accumulated for over 11 billion
years to build up enough energy to light a 7{-watt nightlight for
one millisecond, said Richard O. Fimmel, project manager at the
NASA Ames Research Center.
   But the signals from Pioneer 10 and its twin, Pioneer 11,
launched in 1973, are strong enough to send ``high quality data on
a daily basis,'' said physicist James Van Allen of the University
of Iowa, a principal investigator on the Pioneer project.
   Van Allen, who discovered the radiation belts surrounding Earth,
said Pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its
original missions to study Jupiter and the asteroid belt between
Mars and Jupiter.
   ``One of the principal current objectives is the observation of
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored
distances from the sun,'' Van Allen said.
   ``We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer
boundary of the heliosphere, which is the sphere of influence of
the sun, and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,''
he said.
   But sadly, he said, Pioneer 10 may stop working before it
reaches the edge of the heliosphere.
   The tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10
years, Fimmel said, and may run out of energy before it reaches
interstellar space.
   Before that, however, Pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to
the shape of the heliosphere.
   And it is relaying strong evidence suggesting Planet X or
possibly two smaller unknown planets exist.
   ``We have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that Uranus and Neptune
are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet
X,'' said Anderson. ``It's conceivable there could be other
gravitational effects on the two orbits.
   ``We haven't ruled out other matter which could be in orbit
around the sun,'' he said. ``It could be small particulate matter.
It could be more than one planet that are very small. The best
hypothesis is a single planet X at one to four Earth masses.''
   Such a planet, he said, would likely be a mixture of ice and
rock.
   Pioneer 10 made its closest approach to Jupiter _ 82,000 miles _
on Dec. 3, 1973, 21 months after it was launched, after traveling
an arc-shaped 620 million-mile path from Earth.
   It was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, fly past
Jupiter and return pictures, chart Jupiter's intense radiation
belts, measure the mass of its four planet-sized moons, and
discover that Jupiter is predominantly a liquid planet.
   Pioneer 11 encountered Jupiter a year later, then reached Saturn
on Sept. 1, 1979.
   Both craft, though partly damaged along the way, far exceeded
their operations guarantee of at least 21 months. A spokesman for
TRW Inc. of Redondo Beach joked Monday that the company would fix
anything wrong with the two Pioneers if NASA could bring them back.

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the Galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the Earth
on its long voyage to Jupiter.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but Johnson said Thursday the last good
pictures before Galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the 1960s.
   Galileo passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. It used Earth's gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach Jupiter in 1995. It used Venus for the same purpose
last February and will fly past Earth again in December 1992.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel Galileo
on its $1.4 billion mission to Jupiter. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study Venus and Earth in dress
rehearsals for exploring Jupiter.
   Three of Galileo's new photographs of the moon and Earth were
released Thursday by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as Galileo zoomed away from Earth, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows Mare
Orientale, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from Earth. Because of
the way the moon orbits Earth, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from Earth.
   Galileo's third picture shows half of Antarctica, including the
Ross Ice Shelf and mountains poking through ice near McMurdo Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
Earth and moon as if we were alien observers,'' Johnson said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   Galileo is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said Clark Chapman, a researcher from the Planetary
Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' Chapman said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   NASA plans to release more pictures Wednesday and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning Earth.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed Thursday during a NASA
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above Australia and more distant peeks at Asia,
India, Baja California and the Andes.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
Jupiter. But after the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, NASA decided it was too risky to launch Galileo from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring Galileo to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

   NASA has started testing sensors aboard
Galileo, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its
thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to Venus
and Jupiter.
   ``We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they
are ready to observe Venus'' when Galileo whizzes past the
cloud-shrouded planet Feb. 9, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   On Friday, Galileo fired its thrusters during a 2{-hour period
so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops,
Wilson said.
   ``The maneuver went off exactly as planned,'' Galileo mission
director Neal Ausman said.
   Wilson said another maneuver may be needed in late January to
fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory. The first trajectory
maneuver was performed in November.
   Galileo was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18.
It will swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so those planets can
act as ``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo toward its 1995
encounter with Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   On Wednesday, the spacecraft was 12{ million miles from Earth,
but had traveled almost 105 million miles along its looping
185-million-mile path to Venus, Wilson said.
   The spacecraft still has 2.3 billion miles left out of its
2.4-billion-mile trip to Jupiter.
   After flying past Earth in December 1990 and December 1992,
Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe in July 1995.
   The orbiter will circle the giant gas planet for 22 months
starting in December 1995, the same month the probe will parachute
into the Jovian atmosphere, collecting information for 75 minutes
until it is crushed by overwhelming atmospheric pressure.
   Scientific information that Galileo collects during February's
Venus flyby won't be transmitted back to Earth until late October,
after the spacecraft unfurls its umbrella-shaped, high-gain
antenna, Wilson said.
   The antenna would be damaged by heat if it were as deployed near
Venus, the second planet from the sun, he added.

<HEAD>Huge Hurricane-Like Storm Found On Neptune; Like Jupiter's Great
Red Spot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant spot roughly 6,200 miles wide has
been discovered on the planet Neptune by the Voyager 2 space probe,
and scientists said Monday it looks like a storm similar to the
Great Red Spot on Jupiter.
   ``It's huge,'' said physicist Edward Stone, Voyager project
scientist for NASA and a vice president of the California Institute
of Technology. ``It would be reasonable to suspect this is a large,
hurricane-like storm system similar to the Great Red Spot.''
   However, Stone said Voyager 2 still is too far from Neptune to
determine if winds are swirling within the gargantuan spot, which
measures about 6,200 miles in diameter. Jupiter's Great Red Spot
contains 250 mph winds.
   Scientists haven't yet named Neptune's spot, but are calling it
``the dark spot'' because it appears darker than the surrounding
blue-greenish atmosphere, he added.
   The color of the spot isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, said Andrew Ingersoll, a Caltech planetary scientist.
   Voyager 2 is hurtling at more than 42,000 mph toward its Aug. 24
close encounter with Neptune. At that time, the hardy spacecraft
will zip within 3,000 miles of the gaseous planet's cloud tops _ by
far the closest of any of Voyager's planetary flybys. Five hours
later, it will fly within 25,000 miles of Triton, one of Neptune's
two known moons.
   By Tuesday, Voyager 2 will be nearly 2.66 billion miles from
Earth and 58.98 million miles from Neptune, traveling at a speed of
42,216 mph, said Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The Neptune encounter will be Voyager 2's fourth and final
planetary flyby since the probe was launched from Cape Canaveral in
1977. It explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   Neptune's dark spot is located at about 25 to 30 degrees latitude
in the planet's southern hemisphere, Ingersoll said, adding that
Voyager also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white spot
_ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees south
latitude.
   Stone said Neptune's dark spot first was clearly recognized in
still photographs taken by Voyager 2's television cameras in April,
and can be seen faintly in pictures taken as early as January.
   It isn't as large as Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which is 16,000
miles across at its widest point _ large enough to contain three
Earths. But the dark spot is just as large relative to Neptune _
about a fifth of the planet's diameter _ as the Great Red Spot is
relative to Jupiter.
   Jupiter's Great Red Spot was discovered more than 350 years ago.
Ingersoll said it is believed to be red because of organic
chemicals, or possibly sulfur or phosphorus, trapped within it.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, Jupiter also contains dozens of
smaller storm systems, which appear as white spots, and Saturn also
has similar storms, although they are less visible, Stone said.
   The major mystery of Jupiter's Great Red Spot is how the storm
has remained intact for centuries, while Earth's hurricanes break up
after a week or two, Ingersoll said.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets like Jupiter and
Neptune may explain the persistence of the spots, he said, adding
that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and Neptune's dark spot, Stone and
Ingersoll said.
   Neptune is the solar system's fourth largest planet and usually
is the eighth planet from the sun. But because Pluto's elongated
elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun, Neptune
currently is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun.

   Voyager 2 found Neptune's moon Triton to
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward
and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean-size floods of
frozen lava, scientists believe.
   If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's
photographs, Triton is only the third object in the universe where
active volcanoes have been identified.
   ``It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the
solar system,'' says Charles Kohlhase, Voyager spacecraft mission
design manager at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras _ somewhat like Earth's northern and southern
lights _ in several places in Neptune's skies and over much of the
day side of Triton, Roger Yelle, of the University of Arizona, said
today.
   The auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light, and they occur at odd
places because of Neptune's tilted magnetic field, Yelle said. When
the particles are pulled toward Earth's poles along magnetic field
lines, they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble
auroras.
   Voyager today snapped and sent back to Earth beautiful
photographs showing the sunlit, crescent edges of Neptune and Triton
as they were backlighted by the sun. NASA expects to release prints
of the photo no earlier than Tuesday.
   Triton apparently has three types of volcanic activity.
   Scientists announced two of them Friday: huge inactive
crater-shaped volcanoes, called calderas, filled with lava made of
ice instead of molten rock; and long fault-line valleys filled with
oozing ice, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube
slit with a razor blade.
   Triton's biggest surprise came Sunday, when U.S. Geological
Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom announced that a third kind of
volcanic activity apparently had been identified. The latest
recorded photographs sent by Voyager reveal what look like active
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles
and gas 12 to 20 miles high.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said University of Arizona planetary scientist Bradford Smith,
leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be
a ``crazy idea,'' but other scientists expressed their support.
   ``It sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis,'' said Voyager

   Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune in addition to
Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It also has
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that
are broad bands of dust.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.65 million miles from Neptune, speeding toward
interstellar space at 37,600 mph.
   As the craft sped toward the ill-defined boundary of the solar
system, about 1,500 mission scientists, engineers and their families
celebrated at a bash that featured rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry
singing ``Go, Voyager, go!'' a slightly modified version of his
classic ``Johnny B. Goode.''
   A recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the
cultural and historical items aboard aboard Voyager.
   The spacecraft made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday
night when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole
cloudtops. Early Friday, it zoomed about 24,000 miles past Triton.
Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed
Triton's volcanic activity.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. But he said the
volcanoes on Triton are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground
pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   ``I believe they are active,'' Soderblom said. ``There's 10 or 20
or 30 _ lots.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps
faster.
   Smith said the deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the
blast.
   Earth's volcanoes spew molten rock, and Io's erupts sulfur. Venus
also may have active volcanoes, but none has been spotted on the
cloud-shrouded planet.
   On Sunday, NASA also revealed more surprises about Triton's
apparently inactive caldera-like volcanoes, which measure up to
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what Smith described as flows
of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.
   The new photos show Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can come up and
overflow,'' Smith said. ``You see that happen in Hawaii all the
time'' when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop Kilauea
volcano.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive,
oceanic-scale flooding, Soderblom said.
   A volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100
years. Smith said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located
on Triton's huge south polar ice cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

   Astronomers at the U.S. Naval Observatory
are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet, a
mysterious, phantom giant that has long captured the speculation
and interest of stargazers.
   Speculation about the existence of another planet evolved
because something, perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the
outer edge of the solar system, is giving a gravitational nudge
that disrupts the predicted orbits of Uranus and Neptune, said
astronomer R.S. Harrington.
   ``We are still incapable of predicting the location of Uranus,''
Harrington said Wednesday. ``It's clear something is wrong in the
outer solar system.''
   Astronomers have theorized since the beginning of the century
that some additional planets existed beyond the orbits of Neptune.
The theory sprang from observations that Uranus failed to orbit the
sun with the majestic and mathematical symmetry experts expected.
   That led to a search that resulted in the 1930 discovery of
Pluto, the ninth known planet in the solar system. Further
searching revealed in 1978 that a moon was orbiting Pluto.
   But Harrington said calculations later showed the combined mass
of Pluto and its moon are about 1,000 times too small to account
for the detected, but unexplained irregularity of the Neptune and
Uranus orbits.
   ``Something is there and we've got to look,'' Harrington said.
   Some astronomers have attributed the abnormal orbit of Uranus
and Neptune to errors in calculation.
   However, Harrington said a model of the solar system created by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which guided the Voyager spacecraft
near both Uranus and Neptune, still is not consistent with recent
observations on the position of Uranus. He said the JPL data seemed
to be in agreement for a time, but new observations show Uranus is
deviating from the expected path.
   ``Our current evidence is that the data is still off,'' he said.
``We still do not understand the outer solar system.''
   A search for Planet X is under way in Washington, the main
office of the Naval Observatory, and at the Black Birch Astrometric
Observatory near Blenheim, New Zealand.
   Harrington said the search has been narrowed using a computer. A
number of theoretical 10-planet solar systems were simulated in a
Naval Observatory computer to determine where Planet X had to be to
produce the effects seen on the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.
   That relatively small area of the heavens will be searched in
April and May by an astrographic telescope at Black Birch. The
telescope will take pictures of the target area on successive
nights and the photos will be sent to Washington for study.
   Harrington said he would use a machine called the blink
comparator to look for the phantom planet. A blink comparator
flashes back and forth between two photo plates, causing an
apparent motion to the observer if any point of light in the twin
photos has changed position from one night to the next.
   Planet X, Harrington said, is thought to be three to five times
larger than Earth and moving in an orbit about three times farther
from the sun than Neptune or Pluto. That would make the phantom
planet about as visible as Pluto, a planet seen only by
sophisticated telescopes.
   A planet in such a distant orbit would take about 1,000 years to
circle the sun.
   Even with the new techniques, Harrington said he was far from
certain that Planet X will be found.
   ``I have no better than a 50-50 confidence level that this thing
is there,'' he said.
   Harrington discussed the Planet X search on the opening day of
the 175th national meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
