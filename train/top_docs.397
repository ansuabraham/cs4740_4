   Thousands of jubilant Berliners surged
through new openings in the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate
today for the first time in 28 years.
   The celebrants braved an intermittent rain as they filled the
square in front of the towering symbol of the postwar division of
Germany that is becoming a monument to the rapprochement of East
Germany and West Germany.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow met West Germany Chancellor
Helmut Kohl at the border for the 3 p.m. (9 a.m. EST) ceremony,
then they walked together into East Germany. They were nearly
mobbed by the crowd as they walked to a platform in front of the
gate to address the exulting Berliners.
   Kohl called the occasion ``a fantastic thing.''
   Thousands drenched by the rain uncorked champagne and danced
atop the Berlin Wall, the once impregnable concrete barrier that is
quickly crumbling.
   The opening was televised live in both countries. ``This is
where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentator for West
Germany's ZDF network.
   Two banners were unfurled near the new crossings to protest the
killings of demonstrators in Romania.
   ``The last time I was here was as a kid when I used to play on
this very spot. I never thought I'd come here again, it's really
wonderful,'' said Peter Rebachmann, 42, of East Berlin.
   ``What a beautiful Christmas present. I am so elated that I can
experience this,'' said a middle-aged woman.
   The crowd cheered and set off firecrackers when East German
workers started dismantling the wall Thursday night. The workers
used a crane to remove the rounded top of the wall.
   ``This is an experience that will go down in history. The gate
was a symbol of division of Germany,'' said Jozef Polak, a West
Berlin mechanic.
   More than 10,000 people had jammed the western side for the two
sections of the wall to fall down. Some climbed on trees to get a
better view. More people kept arriving throughout the night.
   A loud cheer sounded through the night air as the East German
crane lifted a 3{-foot-wide segment of the concrete to make the
first hole in that part of the wall shortly after midnight.
   The two new crossing points are 15 feet wide each. One is for
Westerners going into East Berlin, the other for East Germans going
to West Berlin.
   Although more than 20 border crossings have been made at the
wall since East Germany opened its borders to the West on Nov. 9,
the Brandenburg Gate has the most symbolic meaning for Berliners.
   The 200-year-old gate, Berlin's most famous landmark, remained
on the eastern side when East Germany's Communist authorities built
the Berlin Wall in 1961.
   Graffiti on the western side at one of the segments to be
removed said, ``One day every wall must fall down.''
   Friedhelm Brinkman, a salesman from Dortmund, West Germany, said
he drove 360 miles to see the event.
   ``This was the central place in Berlin where everything happened
(before the war). I always thought this place would be opened again
and that's why I came tonight,'' he said late Thursday.
   Some people in the crowd shouted, ``Germany, United
Fatherland,'' _ the rallying call of East German supporters of
German unification.
   
   The crowd was kept well away from the wall by barricades and
cordons of West Berlin police to prevent them from possibly trying
to cross the wall.
   After East Germany's dramatic opening of the borders, thousands
of people danced on the section of the Berlin Wall at Brandenburg
Gate.
   Crowds pulled down one segment of the wall in unforgettable
scenes seen on television worldwide. Thousands of people had waited
in vain for the gate to be opened in the first few days after the
Berlin Wall started crumbling down in the wake of East Germany's
peaceful revolution.
   Kohl and Modrow announced the agreement to open the two
crossings when Kohl visited Dresden on Wednesday.
   The gate, the size of a five-story building on top of which is a
bronze chariot with the goddess Victoria, was the backdrop for
Hitler's rise to power and his last stand. It was also where East
German workers began a 1953 uprising that was crushed by Soviet
tanks.
   In East Berlin, the famous Unter den Linden boulevard ends at
the gate. On the Western side, the sprawling avenue that leads to
the gate was renamed June 17 Street, after the date of the uprising.
   Nazi brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the
gate when Adolf Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   In the final days of World War II, the six-column sandstone gate
was heavily damaged as Soviet tanks closed in on Hitler's bunker in
the chancellory. It marked the border between the Soviet and
British sectors when the victorious allies divided conquered Berlin
into four sectors.

   Tens of thousands of people surged through
two new Berlin Wall openings Friday and celebrated at the
Brandenburg Gate, a monument to German unity that became a symbol
of division when the wall went up in 1961.
   The new passages, immediately north and south of the towering
gate, were opened at 3 p.m. in a ceremony attended by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany and the East German premier, Hans
Modrow.
   Berliners rushed through them, back and forth, then uncorked of
champagne and drank to the famous landmark that was sealed inside
East Berlin for 28 years.
   Security on both sides collapsed as the vast crowd broke through
metal barriers and rushed to the gate, filling the vast Paris
Square, where people hugged each other and danced together.
   A sea of people who had waited patiently for hours in
intermittent rain surrounded the 200-year-old sandstone monument.
   West Berlin police said about 30,000 people gathered on the
Western side before the gate was opened. The crowd on the Eastern
side appeared much larger, but there were no official estimates of
its size.
   More than 20 crossings have been cut through the wall since East
Germany opened its borders Nov. 9, but the freeing of the
Brandenburg Gate was the emotional climax of the coming together of
a people divided since the end of World War II.
   In addition to being cut off from West Berliners, the gate also
was inaccessible to East Berliners until Friday because it lay in
the off-limits East German border zone.
   Flags of Berlin, West Germany and East Germany flew above the
huge crowd. Several people who climbed the wall held up a sign
saying ``Come Together.''
   Hundreds of people climbed atop the thick section of wall that
remains directly in front of the gate, dancing and hugging in
chaotic scenes reminiscent of November.
   Kohl called the opening of the gate a ``fantastic thing.''
   He and Modrow met at 3 p.m. on the border, shook hands and
walked together to a platform to address the crowd. They were
nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd.
   National television of both countries broadcast the event.
``This is where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentator
for the ZDF network of West Germany.
   Modrow said the historic Brandenburg Gate's new function should
be ``to serve the peace.''
   The speeches were drowned out by the mass of people, many with
tears in their eyes, shouting with joy.
   Peter Rebachmann, a 42-year-old East Berliner, said: ``The last
time I was here was as a kid, when I used to play on this very
spot. I never thought I'd come here again; it's really wonderful.''
   ``It's great, but it's too bad my father didn't live to see
it,'' said Hans Achtzehnig, another resident of East Berlin.
   ``What a beautiful Christmas present!'' said a middle-aged woman
who did not give her name.
   Several signs carried by the crowd called for German unity, a
demand made by a growing number of participants in East German
demonstrations.
   ``Berlin, One city, One Nation,'' said one sign.
   People on the eastern side of the wall greeted Kohl with shouts
of ``Helmut! Helmut!'' He and Modrow announced the agreement to
open the gate during a visit Kohl made to East Germany on Tuesday
and Wednesday.
   Thousands of people cheered and set off firecrackers earlier
when East German workers began knocking the new holes in the wall.
   The Brandenburg Gate, its battle-scarred columns are topped with
a bronze chariot of the goddess Victory in a chariot, was the
backdrop for Adolf Hitler's rise to power and his last stand. It
also was where East German workers began an uprising in 1953 that
was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   In East Berlin, the Unter den Linden boulevard ends at the gate.
On the Western side, the avenue that leads to the gate was renamed
June 17, for the date of the uprising.
   Nazi ``brown shirts'' made a triumphant torchlit parade through
the gate when Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   In the final days of World War II, the six-column gate, five
stories high, was badly damaged when Soviet tanks closed in on
Hitler's bunker in the chancellery. It marked the border between
the Soviet and British sectors when the victorious allies divided
Berlin into four sectors.

   Thousands of East Berliners poured through
new Berlin Wall border crossings at the Brandenburg Gate today for
a final, frantic day of Christmas shopping in the well-stocked
stores of the West.
   Other Berliners headed for home after singing and dancing late
into the night at the newly opened gate, which has been transformed
from a symbol of Germany's divisions into one of East-West
rapprochement.
   Although visa-free travel for West Germans to East Germany
technically does not take effect until Sunday, there were few
formalities at the Brandenburg Gate, opened only Friday, for those
who headed East today.
   Throughout the night Friday, a steady clink of metal against
stone accompanied the merrymakers as hundreds of souvenir seekers
chipped away at the Berlin Wall near the gate in the 28-year-old
Berlin Wall.
   At other crossing points, East German shoppers laden with
purchases from West Berlin carried Christmas presents, cases of
beer and bags of oranges.
   West German television periodically carried live coverage of the
festivities Friday night, showing the crowd dancing on top of the
wall, popping champagne corks and waving sparklers.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans
Modrow met Friday for the second time in a week at a ceremony
formally opening two border crossings in the wall just north and
south of the towering gate.
   Security collapsed as soon as the two crossings were opened.
Thousands of people pushed down metal barriers erected to control
the crowd and swept through the vast Paris square, snaking through
the gate and climbing the wall.
   West Berlin police estimated that more than 30,000 people had
gathered on the Western side for the ceremony. The crowd on the
Eastern side appeared to be much larger, but there were no official
estimates.
   Although more than 20 border crossings have been cut through the
Berlin Wall since East Germany opened its borders to the West on
Nov. 9, the opening of the Brandenburg Gate was the emotional
climax of the rapid merger of the people divided since the end of
World War II.
   The openings resulted from a popular uprising in East Germany
that drove out its hard-line Communist leaders.
   When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Brandenburg Gate,
Berlin's most famous landmark that straddled a main prewar
thoroughfare, remained in the East. It was also inaccessible to
East Berliners until Friday because it was part of the off-limit
East German border zone.
   The crowd carried Berlin, West German and East German flags. One
large sign saying in English ``Come Together'' was held aloft by
several people who climbed atop the wall.
   The thick section of the wall directly in front of the gate
remains, but hundreds climbed on top to dance and hug in joyful
scenes reminiscent of the time when the borders were first opened
in November.
   Kohl said the opening of the gate was a ``fantastic thing.''
   He and Modrow met Friday afternoon on the border line, shook
hands and then walked together to a platform to address the crowd.
   The two leaders were nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd as
security officials tried in vain to establish some control.
   The ceremony was broadcast live on both countries' national
television.
   ``This is where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentator
for West Germany's ZDF network.
   Modrow reminded the crowd of the role the gate has played in
German history, then said its new function should be ``to serve the
peace.''
   Kohl said, ``This is the happiest day in my life, because I feel
that here in Berlin I am standing in the middle of Germany.''
   ``We need the sympathy, the support and the approval of our
neighbors'' as the two Germanys move closer together, he said. ``We
want peace and freedom.''
   The speeches were drowned out by the noisy crowd. Many people
had tears in their eyes as they mingled together.
   ``Berlin, have fun now,'' West Berlin mayor Walter Momper told
the crowd.

   The battle-scarred sandstone columns of the
Brandenburg Gate, which were the backdrop for Hitler's last stand
and a workers' uprising against Communism in 1953, once again tower
over the stage of history.
   The 200-year-old gate, Berlin's most famous landmark, has stood
as the symbol of German division for 28 years.
   With the Berlin Wall quickly crumbling, the gate is being called
the symbol of German unity. It also has been the backdrop for much
of the television coverage beamed around the world in the past week
of fast-moving developments.
   East Germany has said it is considering opening a Berlin Wall
border crossing at the Brandenburg Gate. There was wide speculation
in West Berlin that an opening would be knocked through the wall
Thursday, although there was no official confirmation.
   The gate _ the size of a five-story building _ remained on the
Eastern side when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The famous
Unten den Linden boulevard ends at the gate.
   On the Western side, the sprawling avenue that leads to the gate
was renamed June 17 Street, after the date of the workers' uprising
in East Berlin in 1953 that was bloodily crushed by Soviet tanks.
   East Berlin workers, angered by the nationalization and
collectivization policies of the Communist government, began their
street demonstrations at the Brandenburg Gate and tore down the red
flag from the top of the gate.
   In the closing days of World War II, Soviet tanks rumbled by the
gate as they closed in on Adolf Hitler's bunker in the chancellery.
Only a few hundred yards away was the heart of Hitler's government
in a small complex on Wilhelmstrasse, which also served as the seat
of the imperial government. The Reichstag also is not far away.
   The Brandenburg Gate also marked Hitler's rise to power. Nazi
brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the gate when
Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   Built from 1788 to 1791 by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the
six-column gate was commissioned by Prussian King Frederick Wilhelm
II. When it was built, it opened the road to the region of
Brandenburg, getting its name.
   The gate was modeled after the Acropolis in Athens to reflect
the king's intention to make Berlin a city of learning and arts.
   On top of the gate is a bronze chariot with the goddess
Victoria. It was hauled away to Paris when Napoleon defeated the
Prussians at Jena and Auerstadt on Oct. 27, 1806. He marched into
Berlin through the Brandenburg Gate.
   The chariot was brought back to Berlin after Napoleon's defeat
in 1814. After the Franco-German war in 1870-71, the victorious
Prussians made a triumphal return to Berlin, the new imperial
capital, again through the Brandenburg Gate.
   The gate was heavily damaged in the last days of World War II
and marked the border between the Soviet and British sectors of
conquered Berlin.
   It was restored between 1956 and 1958. The chariot was repaired
and paid for by West Berlin under Mayor Willy Brandt, but East
Berlin authorities removed the Prussian eagle and the iron cross
from Victoria's staff before mounting it again.
   In 1963, Communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the
gate to prevent President John F. Kennedy from looking into East
Berlin when he visited West Berlin and delivered his ``Ich bin ein
Berliner'' speech.
   The gate, the last of the 20 gates to Berlin still standing, is
66 feet high, 215 feet wide and 36 feet deep.

<P>
The Brandenburg Gate, the Cold War symbol of a divided Berlin, a divided 
Germany and a divided Europe, was reopened Friday afternoon amid joyous scenes 
undampened by gray skies, relentless rain and the quickly gathering darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The historic, six-columned Grecian-style monument in the heart of the sprawling 
former capital of the German Empire was overwhelmed by East and West Berliners 
who swarmed around it, reveling in this long-awaited Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall was breached in two places at either side of the Brandenburg 
Gate, leaving a staunch, thick portion of the wall in place. But the wall 
itself seemed almost superfluous, as young people climbed over it, posing for 
pictures and waving champagne bottles, then jumped down on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The two new border crossings, which had been prepared by East German engineers 
all night Thursday, were formally opened at 3 p.m. Friday by West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on the east 
side of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
As Kohl and Modrow walked through the central arch of the 200-year-old gate, 
originally built to separate old Berlin from the fields to the west, Modrow 
declared: "This is where the German Reich went down in flames lit by German war 
criminals. The burning stench of war must never again be smelled here. It must 
be a gate of peace." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, many East Germans in the crowd chanted: "Helmut, Helmut!" 
</P>
<P>
Kohl seemed purposely to avoid sounding the German reunification issue in his 
brief speech when he said: "Let us be patient and prudent in the steps we have 
to take to walk forward into our common future." 
</P>
<P>
But a banner said it for Kohl in English: "Berlin Is One Town -- Germany Is One 
Nation." 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper told the crowd: "Berlin is still divided but 
the people are no longer separated." 
</P>
<P>
East and West Berlin police officers made no attempt to interfere with 
celebrants atop the wall, nor with others who for the first time began banging 
away at the wall from the east side to chip off pieces. 
</P>
<P>
As the wine corks popped, the British Royal Welch Fusiliers band -- the gate 
stands in the British sector of West Berlin -- played marches, but then broke, 
incongruously, into "Deep in the Heart of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a trumpet player standing with thousands of other revelers on top 
of the wall, the crowd sang everything from "Amazing Grace" to "Such a Day as 
Wonderful as Today," an old Berlin folk favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks lent the occasion a festive atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall has been opened at various checkpoints since Nov. 9, but the 
Brandenburg Gate had never served as a border crossing since the wall went up 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Before the wall was erected, the gate had been the entryway between the two 
sides of the divided city. Under it passed the Unter Den Linden, once the most 
famous and elegant thoroughfare in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier times, the gate was the center arch for promenades by Prussian 
aristocrats, Nazi parades with Hitler in an open car and, in the end, for 
Soviet tanks marauding through it during the apocalyptic Battle for Berlin in 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
So for many Germans, the Brandenburg Gate's opening Friday has been the 
ultimate test of the East German government's decision to liberalize relations 
between East and West Berlin -- and the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
As Franz Bertele, West Germany's chief emissary to East Germany, put it as he 
wandered on the east side: "It's a great feeling to be able to walk under the 
gate after 28 years. We never thought we would live long enough to see this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"My only problem is that I lost my wife in all the excitement. I'm trying to 
find her." 
</P>
<P>
One couple who were married in East Berlin on Friday decided to come through 
the new Brandenburg opening to have a ceremonial dinner in West Berlin. 
Dietrich and Sybile Schumann, she wearing a white hat and veil and carrying a 
bouquet of flowers, both said "wunderbar" -- wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"My own parents met at the Brandenburg Gate in 1958," said Sybile. "So walking 
through on my wedding day is lovely -- even though it is raining." 
</P>
<P>
And under the tall columns, three generations of one East Berlin family were 
heading west -- for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Grandfather Willi Szeszrat, son Juergen, and 8-year-old grandson, Mario, walked 
together toward the new opening. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to be part of it all," said Juergen.

   The big arm of the crane smashed into the
stacked slabs of concrete like a fist through a window, scattering
enough bits of Berlin Wall to fill a dozen souvenir stands.
   A small crowd lingered close to midnight Sunday to watch the
floodlit scene, wincing as a screeching, scraping array of machines
began clearing away the most famous section of the battered barrier.
   From this spot _ the gigantic Brandenburg Gate serving as a
breathtaking backdrop _ came the most vivid image of the collapse
of Communist East Germany.
   Thousands climbed the section of wall when the country's borders
were opened on Nov. 9, chipping away at the stretch of stone that
that was once an art gallery of political graffiti.
   ``I remember walking with my old mother here on Nov. 5 and
telling her that it won't be long before this wall is gone,'' said
West Berliner Hans Ulrich, 42, as he leaned on a guardrail and
watched the destruction.
   ``Of course, I'd been saying that for years.''
   When they built the wall around West Berlin nearly three decades
ago, Communist authorities put the most effort into the 575-foot
section that loops around the Brandenburg Gate. It was by far the
most heavily reinforced, a semi-circle of concrete slabs cemented
together and woven with heavy cable.
   With the 18th-century Brandenburg Gate the symbol of old Berlin,
this section of wall was the symbol of its division, splitting the
wide avenue that was once a main thoroughfare.
   After the wall was opened, a border crossing was cut into it at
Brandenburg Gate and the area became a major tourist attraction.
   Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything from Berlin Wall
keychains to membership pins worn by East Germany's notorious
former secret police.
   Much of the imaginative graffiti has been chiseled away by
souvenir hunters who place great value on paint-splashed pieces of
wall. New, post-revolution graffiti has taken its place.
   ``The wall is on its way to your hometown,'' read one comment.
   The new East German government has said it will remove all of
the 100-mile barrier that encircles West Berlin. A few weeks ago,
long sections adjacent the Brandenburg Gate were demolished.
   Late Saturday night, after most of the tourists had gone home, a
West German construction crew and East German soldiers began taking
down the section of wall directly in front of the gate.
   They planned to work only at night, completing the removal
within a week. Officials say they hope to restore auto traffic down
the divided street.
   About 400 people watched Sunday night as a giant jackhammer
hooked to the end of a crane continued the slow battle against the
wall's most formidable stretch.
   ``It is a symbol, but it kept people apart,'' said East Berliner
Fabian Evers, 18, as he sold chunks of wall on a blanket near the
gate. ``It is an ideological statement to tear it down.''
   Ulricht, a school teacher, said he has no desire to see this
part of the wall remain as a memorial.
   ``This section was a symbol not only of the division of Berlin
and Germany, but of East and West Europe,'' he said. ``I enjoy very
much that this wall is coming down.''

<TEXT>
   The Brandenburg Gate, a towering
monument to unity that became a symbol of discord, will reopen by
Christmas after being closed by the Berlin Wall for a generation,
the government said Tuesday.
   State television reported the date after Premier Hans Modrow and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany held a summit and said the
gate would be opened on Christmas Eve but its editors late Tuesday
said the announcer had misread his text and that the date for
reopening was by Christmas Day.
   Modrow, Kohl and the mayors of East and West Berlin will preside
Sunday, the television report said.
   On Tuesday, West Berlin police began setting up crowd-control
barriers in front of the wall at the gate, which is in East Berlin.
   At their summit, Modrow and Kohl agreed to negotiate closer ties
between the two Germany's created at the end of World War II. The
Berlin Wall was built in 1961.
   Modrow said that visa-free travel between East and West Germany
will begin Christmas Eve and his government will free all political
prisoners.
   In a joint statement, the German leaders said ``a
good-neighborly relationship between the two states ... is of great
importance for stability in Europe and represents a contribution to
the new European architecture.''
   At a news conference after their meeting, Modrow would not be
specific about the Brandenburg Gate pedestrian crossing, but Kohl
said: ``We will all be able to take a walk across to the
Brandenburg Gate before Christmas.''
   The Brandenburg Gate was built 200 years ago and opened the road
to the region of Brandenburg in Prussia, but its six battle-scarred
sandstone columns became a symbol of division after the wall was
built in 1961. The gate, the size of a five-story building,
remained on the eastern side.
   In 1963, Communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the
gate to prevent President John F. Kennedy from looking into East
Berlin when he visited West Berlin.
   With the political upheaval that has ended Communist domination
in East Germany and opened the country's once-locked borders, the
gate is viewed by millions as the symbol of German unity.
   The issue of how to bring the nations closer dominated the first
meeting of Kohl and Modrow, and the public reaction highlighted the
debate raging over possible reunification after more than four
decades.
   Workers in hard hats left their jobs and joined thousands of
others to catch a glimpse of Kohl as he rode to the meeting in his
motorcade of black Mercedes limousines.
   ``Helmut! Helmut!'' and ``Germany, united fatherland!'' they
shouted.
   But posters in the city center read ``Kohl Go Home.''
   ``A Fourth Reich _ Is that why you stayed behind?'' said one,
referring to East Germans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy
West Germany, choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild
their troubled socialist state.
   East German TV reported 5,000 people demonstrated against
reunification in East Berlin, shouting ``Nazis out!''
   Modrow opposes reunification, and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevadrdnadze reiterated the Kremlin's opposition to
reunification during a speech Tuesday to the European Parliament.
   ``It is necessary to proceed on the basis of the postwar
realities, namely, the existence of two sovereign German states.
... A retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in
Europe,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:
   _ Shooting and fires were reported in western Romania, where
there were reports that security forces have killed hundreds of
people who protested the harsh Communist regime of President
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   _ Former Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel received an
endorsement for the presidency from the Communist premier, Marian
Calfa, who urged that he be elected before the end of the year.
   _ The Soviet Parliament pushed through an economic reform plan
that retains heavy central planning, in a no-confidence vote that
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his ministers easily survived.
   _ Lithuania's Communist Party leader urged a united political
front with other parties to press for sovereignty and protect the
Baltic republic from Kremlin pressure. Algirdis Brazauskas avoided
calling for an immediate, direct break with the Soviet Communist
Party or for Lithuanian indepenence, but he left open both
possibilities.
   The German summit began with the signing of an economic
cooperation agreement and pacts to boost cultural and travel ties.
   A significant development is the planned treaty to improve
cooperation and relations. Negotiations will start immediately,
Modrow said, with Kohl saying he hoped the treaty could be signed
by spring.
   The leaders planned a second summit in late January or early
February.
   Perhaps the most striking aspect of the summit was the welcome
Kohl received.
   Later, at an evening rally, a crowd of 20,000 burst into rounds
of wild cheers and applause as the West German leader addressed
them as his ``countrymen'' and promised not to abandon them.
   ``God bless our German fatherland,'' he said.
   Some, however, carried signs supporting East German sovereignty.
   Kohl spoke near the ruins of the Frauenkirche (Church of Our
Lady), destroyed during World War II. There Kohl laid a bouquet in
memory of war victims before addressing the flag-waving crowd.
   ``Unity! Unity! Unity!'' they shouted as he began to speak.
   Kohl promised West German aid for the economic recovery,
assuring the crowd: ``We will not desert our countrymen.''
   But mindful of warnings from East German leaders, the
superpowers and European neighbors that a reunited Germany could
threaten peace, Kohl promised East Germans: ``We will respect what
you decide for the future.''
   The last such summit was Sept. 7-8, 1987, in Bonn, when Kohl met
Honecker. The last time a West German chancellor visited East
Germany was in December 1981, when Helmut Schmidt met with Honecker
in Werbellinsee.

   Tourists have chiseled so many souvenirs out
of the Berlin Wall that some sections are in danger of collapsing,
and police have had to cordon off one especially hard-hit area near
the Brandenburg Gate.
   The East German government plans eventually to tear down the
entire wall and replace it with normal border markings, President
Manfred Gerlach disclosed in an interview last week. But free-lance
demolition work has already proceeded on the 100-mile border
barrier, especially on the West Berlin side.
   East German border guards on Sunday welded steel bars over a
gaping hole near the Brandenburg Gate to shore up the reinforced
concrete structure.
   West Berlin police put up crowd control barriers Saturday around
the most damaged sections to keep adults and children from climbing
inside giant holes carved out of a double-walled segment. Police
cited a danger of collapse.
   Once covered by graffiti, the wall has been chipped bare at the
Brandenburg Gate, the 18th-century arch that now symbolizes German
unity.
   The wall has also taken a beating at Checkpoint Charlie, the
famed intra-Berlin crossing, but police said they do not fear a
collapse there.
   On Sunday, onlookers and chippers on the West Berlin side booed
when East German border guards welded steel bars over a 7-foot-high
hole at the Reichstag, the former seat of Germany's parliament near
the Brandenburg Gate.
   Enterprising vendors have been selling pieces of the wall for up
$30 and even rent hammers and chisels for do-it-yourself chipping.
   But each wall chunk removed means lost business for East Germany.
   An East German company said last month it plans to raise Western
currency by selling sections of the wall removed from the
Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, a square that was the hub of
1920s Berlin.
   Profits from sales are to go to humanitarian causes.
   Communist East German authorities have punched dozens of
crossings into the wall since their decision Nov. 9 to open borders
to the West, The action was the result of a sudden and peaceful
popular revolution that drummed hard-line Communist leaders out of
power.

   A cacophony of drums, saxophones and
firecrackers pierced the air early today and fireworks illuminated
the Berlin Wall as tens of thousands of people from East and West
celebrated New Year's together.
   Tens of thousands poured in both directions through the newly
opened Brandenburg Gate each hour, and thousands more scaled the
wall and tumbled into the other Germany as border guards watched
with amusement.
   In a revival of the city-wide street party that erupted when the
Berlin Wall opened Nov. 9, young people scrambled atop the divide
to take in the scene on both sides, bobbing and rocking to the
erratic rhythm of the concert without conductor at Brandenburg Gate.
   Hammers clanged against chisels as hundreds mined the wall for
souvenirs.
   After midnight, some scaffolding supporting an outdoor
projection screen near Brandenburg Gate collapsed under the weight
of revelers, killing a man and injuring 135 people, East Germany's
official ADN news agency reported. Seventy-seven of them were
hospitalized, it said.
   ADN said drunks and a carpet of broken glass from champagne
bottles hindered rescue workers.
   In other border areas, police police arrested 68 neo-Nazi
activists overnight after they tried to stage illegal
demonstrations. Authorities in both German states had formed joint
patrols to prevent disturbances threatened by right-wing radicals.
   A West Berlin counter-culture group had appealed to Berliners on
both sides of the crumbling divide to bring musical instruments and
inspiration to the battle-scarred gate, for a concert to fete the
first New Year's in four decades that Germans have celebrated
together.
   ``We just wanted to be here for it. It's fantastic,'' said
21-year-old Kerry Bundgaard of Phoenix as her father videotaped the
scene.
   ``The wall is open for the first time in my life. We want to
celebrate along with everyone else,'' said Hans-Juergen Witfeld,
who traveled from the Ruhr Valley city of Dortmund with eight
friends to spend the holiday in cold and misty Berlin.
   At midnight, fireworks filled the midnight sky over Brandenburg
Gate. The soot-stained monument was swathed in smoke as young
people from around the world clamored atop the surrounding wall and
scaled even the tarnished bronze chariot that crowns the columned
gate.
   Since East German authorities began punching holes in the
graffiti-splattered concrete that had severed Berlin since 1961,
the wall has become more a bridge than a barrier.
   Tour buses from throughout Europe shuttled thousands to the
heart of the party, a stretch of pock-marked wall between the
Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin and a towering Christmas tree on
the west side.
   Tourists filled every hotel and restaurant to capacity on both
sides of the wall and jammed streets and parking lots with
impromptu parties.
   Enterprising youth like 15-year-old Salim Mussa hawked chips of
the wall for up to $30, West Berliners rented out hammers and
chisels, and the West German government operated a mobile
information booth for any East German visitors considering
relocation in the West.
   Border police said they had no estimate of the numbers crossing
between the two Germanys.

   East Germany will tear down a 600-foot
section of the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate and allow
completely unhindered passage between the two sides of the city
there, West German television said.
   Since November, the East Germans have created numerous passage
points through the Berlin Wall but have retained nominal checks of
passports or identity cards.
   The section at the Brandenburg Gate will be the first section
without any official controls.
   ``The Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate will be torn down,''
the ZDF television network said Friday. ``East German border troops
will start the work on Monday.''
   ``There will then be unhindered passage between East and West
from the Reichstag to the Brandenburg Gate. There will not be a
fence there as originally planned.''
   The wall, for years a symbol of the division of Europe, was
built in 1961 to prevent East German laborers from leaving. A
popular uprising in East Germany last fall toppled the hard-line
leadership and forced the opening of the wall in November.

   A solitary building stands on the far corner of
the once teeming and elegant Potsdamer Platz, now a desolate no
man's land overlooking a jagged corner of the Berlin Wall.
   Potsdamer Platz will soon regain at least a semblance of its
former prominence after 28 years as a Cold War curiosity, East
German officials said Friday.
   Devastated during World War II and long a lonely tourist
attraction for a glimpse over the Berlin Wall, Potsdamer Platz will
shortly become another major transit checkpoint between East and
West Berlin.
   Its opening comes as part of East Berlin's decision to open its
borders to the West, officials say.
   Since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Potsdamer Platz and
similar landmarks have been sober reminders of the brutal division
of the city and the two Germanys.
   For many Berliners, the blockaded Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer
Platz are the starkest symbols of that division. In both cases, two
main thoroughfares end abrubtly at the concrete base of the
imposing, graffiti-smeared Wall.
   When Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany
told a rally in West Berlin that the East Germans had decided to
punch a hole through the Wall at Potsdamer Platz, the crowd roared
with applause and cheers.
   Another famous crossing has also taken on new tasks.
   Berlin's Glienicke Bridge, a frequent site of East-West swaps of
spies and political prisoners, has since been opened to accommodate
more travelers.
   Another notorious stretch of the Wall is also to be opened _
Bernauer Strasse, where scenes of dramatic escape attempts stunned
the world 28 years ago.
   A house near the new checkpoint still stands with its
westward-facing windows boarded and sealed with bricks, testimony
to the first desperate attempts to jump to freedom as the Wall was
going up.
   Nearby, others died later in escape attempts that ended in a
hail of bullets. Eighty people died trying to cross the Wall.
   The Wall's most famous crossing, Checkpoint Charlie, will remain
in use for foreign visitors, although East German border guards
have allowed scores of East Berliners to use the crossing since
travel restrictions were lifted on Friday.
   No plans have surfaced so far to tear down the concrete barriers
that stand in front of the massive, 18th-century Brandenburg Gate,
which for decades has been a rallying point of protest against the
city's partition.

   The mayors of East and West Berlin shook hands
Sunday at a new Berlin Wall crossing point in a historic meeting
symbolizing the crumbling of the Cold War relic that divided the
city since 1961.
   Their meeting came after more than 1 million East Germans poured
into West Germany on Saturday, taking advantage of their
government's opening of Western borders. The vast majority intended
to make a brief visit and then return to the East.
   On Sunday, West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper and his East Berlin
counterpart, Erhard Krack, met at the Potsdamer Platz, a bleak,
virtual no-man's land bisected by the Berlin Wall.
   Hours before their morning session, East German workers drilled
a hole through the wall with jackhammers at Potsdamer Platz,
creating the third new border crossing point since East Germany's
Communist leaders announced the end of travel restrictions late
last week.
   Momper and Krack later left the area for breakfast and talks in
a West Berlin hotel.
   The new freedom to travel and other reforms in East Germany have
touched off a wave of enthusiam about the possibility of reuniting
the two German states divided at the end of World War II.
   However, East German Communist leader Egon Krenz on Saturday
dismissed such talk.
   The new wave of visitors to West Berlin and West Germany on
Sunday was expected to exceed Saturday's estimated 1.3 million
visitors, almost 8 percent of East German's 16.6 million population.
   Most of Saturday's exuberant visitors returned home overnight,
West German border police said.
   A core of East German and West Berlin revelers kept a joyful
vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the western side of the
Berlin Wall.
   However, West Berlin riot police vans lined up in front of the
wall at the Brandenburg Gate early Sunday to try to fend off
revelers who lit torches and candles in memory of East Germans
killed trying to escape over the wall.
   At the Friederichstrasse crossing point, known as Checkpoint
Charlie, renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich gave an impromptu
concert Saturday in front of a section of the wall covered with
graffiti.
   Police said a 24-year-old visitor from Potsdam, East Germany,
went into labor on bustling Wuerttembergische Strasse and gave
birth to a girl on the sidewalk, to the delight of a surrounding
crowd.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said he would meet with
Krenz, whose three weeks in office have brought a whirlwind of
change, to discuss ways of cooperating in the new age.
   However, Krenz told Kohl to forget any ideas of making the two
nations that rose from the rubble of World War II into a single
Germany again.
   East Germany's Communist authorities built the 14-foot-high
Berlin Wall beginning Aug. 13, 1961, to stem a flow of workers to
the West. Ironically, it was another flight this year, of more than
200,000 East Germans, that forced them to open it.
   East German leaders lifted travel regulations and pledged
greater democratic freedoms after both the exodus and weeks of
street protests.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany tried to reassure opponents of German reunification today
and said their fears of an evil German empire based on past horrors
are ``absurd.''
   Kohl, during a news conference closing a triumphant two-day
visit, also said he expects a treaty expanding East and West German
ties to be completed by May.
   Kohl met with Communist Premier Hans Modrow on Tuesday, and the
two later announced plans for the treaty and a number of other
changes:
   _The famed Brandenburg Gate, isolated in East Berlin since the
Berlin Wall was built in 1961, will be reopened by Christmas.
   _Germans will be allowed to travel without visas between the two
states beginning Christmas Eve.
   _East Germany will free all political prisoners, with many to be
released before Christmas.
   Kohl pledged to take into account the concerns of other European
countries as the two German states, created after World War II,
move closer together.
   ``It's the most natural thing that Germans want to live
together,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl pledged to avoid ``destabilization,'' a reference to the
power vacuum in East Germany that has followed the virtual collapse
of Communist Party control here since a popular revolution began in
the fall.
   Kohl added: ``Fears based in the past are understandable, but
there is nothing to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talk
about a Fourth Reich.''
   East German Communists and other opponents of reunification have
said joining the two states could create a ``Fourth Reich,'' and
have reminded people of the atrocities of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich.
   In meeting with several opposition groups, including New Forum,
Democratic Awakening, and others, Kohl said he heard none of them
voice opposition to eventual reunification.
   New Forum representative Arnold Vaatz told the official news
agency ADN he found ``broad agreement'' with Kohl and that his
group was ``thankful'' for the results of the summit.
   Earlier today, Kohl met with the Roman Catholic bishops of
Dresden and Berlin, Joachim Reinelt and Georg Sterzinsky.
   Sterzinsky said he and Reinelt explained their views on future
cooperation with West Germany in the meeting with Kohl.
   Sterzinsky said he expects West Germany to ``treat us as a
partner and help with our renewal.'' He viewed the visit by Kohl, a
conservative Christian Democrat, as ``entirely positive,'' the
official news agency ADN reported.
   West Germany's Bild newspaper quoted unidentified officials in
Dresden as saying Berlin's Brandenburg Gate will be open to
pedestrians Friday. The newspaper said its report would appear in
Thursday's editions. It was sent in advance to other news media
today.
   The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of German unity to millions and
was a centerpiece of a major Berlin thoroughfare before the wall
was built 28 years ago.
   Under the pressure of massive pro-democracy demonstrations
starting in October, openings have been made in the wall, two sets
of Communist leaders have been ousted, and free elections are
scheduled in May. At the same time, West Germany has warmly
accepted all East German refugees and offered to help revive its
neighbor's struggling economy.
   At a joint news conference after their summit, Kohl and Modrow
said their talks had made progress toward what the two nations
refer to as a ``treaty community.'' Such an arrangement would
safeguard the sovereignty of both states.
   Talks leading up to the planned bilateral treaty could focus on
improving traffic connections, telecommunications and pollution
problems, Kohl said.
   Both leaders agreed to meet again in late January or early
February in West Germany.
   While Kohl stressed the ``right of self-determination'' for
citizens in both Germany on the issue of reunification, Modrow
called for the continued existence of two German states.
   Kohl joined his host in counseling caution and patience.
   Later, Kohl received an emotional welcome from a crowd of about
20,000 at an outdoor evening rally.
   People repeatedly burst into wild cheers, applause and chants of
``Unity!'' ``Unity!'' as Kohl addressed them as his ``countrymen.''
   Many waved West German flags, outnumbering those carrying signs
insisting on East German sovereignty or attacking Kohl.

Germany -- providing that the government introduces stringent economic and 
political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The East German regime is also considering opening up the Berlin Wall near the 
Brandenburg Gate, East Berlin's best-known monument and symbol, according to 
the official news agency ADN. 
</P>
<P>
But Modrow was quoted in Tuesday's editions of the West German newspaper Bild 
as saying that while the Berlin Wall can remain open to travel, it must remain 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
"In our country, there is little criminal activity . . . cases of AIDS 
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and drugs are virtually unknown. Our 
people are asking themselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is," Bild 
quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people crossing the Berlin Wall on Tuesday was estimated at 
180,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, West German Red Cross officials reported that the number of 
East German refugees approaching them about returning home has reached 10,000. 
Counseling services for potential returnees have been set up at West German 
relocation camps to advise East Germans whether they will be penalized if they 
go back. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to form a coalition regime, Modrow sought out the leaders of the four 
small parties: the Democratic Farmers' Party, the Christian Democratic Union, 
the Liberal Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
These smaller parties, which in the past rubber-stamped Communist orders, have 
seats in the Parliament and have been increasingly critical of government 
policies and the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Communists occupy 39 of the 43 Cabinet posts, and Modrow is expected to reduce 
the size of the Cabinet as well as make it more of a coalition. ADN gave no 
details of the meeting, and Modrow did not say whether the opposition would 
join his conception of a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Guenter Schabowski, a prominent member of the Politburo, resigned as party 
chief for East Berlin, ADN reported. Political analysts say Schabowski, 
considered to be a leading reform-minded politician, may receive an important 
post in Modrow's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
He earlier had indicated he might surrender the city post because of a heavy 
workload. He remains in the Politburo and as the party's propaganda chief. He 
was replaced as party chief for the capital by Hans Albrecht. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new, non-Communist Speaker of the East German Parliament said he 
will seek to change the first article of the country's constitution, which 
defines the Communist Party's leading role in society. The party has used the 
provision to justify its monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
Guenther Maleuda told a meeting of his Democratic Farmers' Party faction in 
Parliament that the Communist Party is to blame for East Germany's economic, 
social and political problems. 
</P>
<P>
The West German pledge of massive financial aid to help rebuild East Germany's 
economy had been made before and was conditional on political and economic 
reforms that the Communists have so far rejected. 
</P>
<P>
But West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann was more specific, offering 
a six-point plan that would include investments and joint ventures, as well as 
revamping the nation's dilapidated communications and transport systems. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann did not specify a figure for the aid and said the plan would be 
useless if East Germany fails to carry out a "thorough change" in its centrally 
directed economy. East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a 
complete free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan, brainchild of U.S. 
Secretary of State George C. Marshall, which sent more than $12 billion in U.S 
aid from 1948-51 to help war-devastated Europe return to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, the rumors that a new border crossing would be punched through 
the Berlin Wall near the historic Brandenburg Gate drew about 200 West 
Berliners to a chilly vigil Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police chiefs from both sides of the wall conferred by phone, and it was 
understood afterward that "nothing will happen tonight," a West Berlin police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if and when it will go down," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ten East German guards stood almost casually atop the wall, gazing down at the 
throngs of West Berliners and reporters, some of whom had staked out their 
spots with pup tents. Television lights cast a bright glow on the 
graffiti-covered western face of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the barricade, floodlights illuminated the gate itself, which came to 
separate the city into Allied and Soviet zones after World War II, also 
severing Berlin's busiest boulevard -- Unter Den Linden. West German police 
kept the crowd about 20 feet back from the wall, which some Berliners danced 
atop last week. 
</P>
<P>
People waited in line to climb the two viewing platforms erected by the West 
years ago to allow tourists a peak over the forbidden wall and the gate behind 
it.

<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Brandenburg Gate, the site where East Germany is considering creating a new 
opening in the Berlin Wall, has for decades served as a mocking reminder of 
Germany's defeat in World War II. Lying in East Berlin just beyond the wall in 
the heart of the divided city, the monument, topped with a bronze statue of the 
Goddess of Victory in a chariot, was erected in 1788-91 to celebrate military 
victories and was named after the German state that later became Prussia. 
Modeled on the Propylaea, the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens, it was 
severely damaged in World War II and has been completely rebuilt.

<HEAD>Workers Begin Removing Famous Section of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers on Saturday began tearing down the
thickest and perhaps most famous part of the Berlin Wall, a stretch
of graffiti-covered concrete in front of the historic Brandenburg
Gate.
   Crowds of tourists and souvenir peddlers watched as East German
soldiers and West German construction workers with heavy tools
began knocking away at the section ofwall that curves around the
18th-century gate.
   The huge, colonnaded gate represents the grandeur of old Berlin
just as the section of wall in front of it symbolized its division.
   The wall provided some of the most memorable images of the
revolution last autumn that ended four decades of Communist
oppression, opened the wall, and began the process of reunifying
the two Germanys. With the giant gate as a backdrop, protesters
with chisels climbed on the wall last year to demonstrate their new
freedom when East Germany's borders were finally opened.
   Much of the surrounding sections of the 100-mile wall already
have been removed, but the section in front of the gate is
considered the sturdiest. It is 10 feet high and equally as thick.
   The area around the Brandenburg Gate has become a heavily
visited tourist area. Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything
from postcards depicting the revolt to key chains made of wall
fragments.
   The work Saturday was part of an ongoing process of removing
certain sections of the wall. The East German government says the
entire wall will eventually be removed, except for one section that
will stand as a monument.
   The East German news agency ADN reported Saturday that 70
segments of the Berlin Wall will be auctioned off on June 23 in the
principality of Monaco.

BERLIN WALL WILL BE PULLED DOWN, EAST GERMAN TELLS HAVEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Berlin Wall, which symbolized the schism between Eastern and Western Europe 
for 28 years, will be pulled down, an East German official said today in a 
dramatic demonstration of the liberalization of the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
East German head of state Manfred Gerlach told visiting Czechoslovak President 
Vaclav Havel that the wall will be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pulling down the wall. It has become superfluous. It will be replaced 
by normal border markings," Gerlach said in the interview with the West German 
daily, Bild. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach said that no date has been set for the wall's removal but that the East 
German government would discuss it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Bild said it interviewed him after he had taken Havel to see the wall and the 
historic Brandenburg Gate today. 
</P>
<P>
Havel told reporters that he was amazed that the wall, built in 1961 and a 
symbol of Germany's and Europe's division until East Germany opened its borders 
in November, is still standing. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerlach told me work would soon start to tear it down. I told him if he had 
any problems we could send some independent Czechoslovak workers to help free 
of charge," he said to loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
Havel also told journalists he would like to say "Ich bin ein Berliner" -- "I 
am a Berliner" -- as did President John F. Kennedy during his visit to Berlin 
in June, 1963, two years after the wall was built. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take the liberty to repeat this sentence at a new time and in 
a new context," Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all walls and barriers in Europe must fall. 
</P>
<P>
Built by Soviet-backed East German troops Aug. 13, 1961, the wall was first 
breached last Nov. 9 as East German authorities were moving away from the 
Stalinist policies that had been their trademark for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Havel visited the East German capital briefly before seeing West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Munich, his first official visits since he was 
elected president Friday as part of an agreement among the Czechoslovak 
government, opposition groups and the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
His trips to the Germanys ahead of one to the Soviet Union reflected a shift in 
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said his visits originally were to be symbolic but turned out to be 
"working visits." 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to discuss many concrete issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Havel said he is opposed to the death penalty but he 
said last week's execution of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife 
may have saved many lives. 
</P>
<P>
After talks with Gerlach and Prime Minister Hans Modrow, Havel praised recent 
developments in East Germany, which has moved away from the Stalinist policies 
it had adhered to since its founding 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us Europeans must thank the GDR (East Germany) for having started 
pulling down one of the worst walls," said Havel, a playwright and essayist, 
who gained prominence during the spring 1968 uprising in Prague that was 
crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"This decade must become the decade of Europeans," said Kohl after meeting with 
Havel in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovakian leader also met with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President Richard von Weizsaecker and opposition leader 
Hans-Jochen Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who was jailed for five years for his opposition to the Communist 
authorities, was awarded the annual Peace Prize of the Frankfurt Book Fair last 
year. The Czechoslovakian government had prevented his traveling to West 
Germany to collect the award. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Havel declared a New Year's amnesty for common criminals and said his 
biggest task is to lead Czechoslovakia toward free elections without violence. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Justice Minister Dagmar Buresova said in a radio address that the 
amnesty will be extensive because many prisoners are serving excessively harsh 
sentences. But she said corrupt public officials will be excluded from the 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many prisoners will be affected by the 
amnesty.

<TEXT>
   The Berlin Wall will be opened
before Christmas at the Brandenburg Gate, the towering monument
viewed by many as a symbol of German unity, East German Premier
Hans Modrow said today.
   The announcement followed a meeting between Modrow and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during which the two leaders
discussed the thorny issue of how to bring the long-divided nations
closer together.
   Since the Berlin Wall started crumbling early last month,
Germans in both East and West have demanded an opening at the gate
to demonstrate the new era of improved relations between the
countries.
   Modrow told reporters the new opening for pedestrians will be
created before Monday. And the date for visa-free travel by West
Germans and West Berliners to East Germany will be moved up from
Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, in time for Christmas and New Year.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe today:
   _Former Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel received an
endorsement for president from the Communist premier, Marian Calfa.
   _Hungarian radio reported that gunfire rang out early today in
the streets of the Romanian city of Timisoara, where bloody clashes
between security forces and anti-government protesters reportedly
left dozens dead last weekend.
   _Yugoslavia's premier suffered a blow after the nation's largest
republic, Serbia, flatly rejected his key reform program that would
introduce market mechanisms into the ailing economy.
   The summit highlighted the debate raging over German
reunification, which Kohl supports and Modrow opposes.
   Chants of ``Helmut! Helmut!'' and ``Germany, united
fatherland!'' rose from the crowd of at least 5,000 that lined the
streets as Kohl's motorcade of black Mercedes limousines carried
him to the meeting at the Hotel Bellevue.
   Workers in hard hats left work to catch a glimpse of the
chancellor, and West German flags and banners calling for German
unity formed a sea of red, black and gold.
   But there were signs of opposition to Kohl's pro-reunification
stance.
   ``A Fourth Reich _ Is that why you stayed behind?'' said one
poster on a fence in the city center. It referred to those East
Germans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy West Germany,
choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild their troubled
socialist state.
   With the ruins of war-ravaged buildings visible in the distance,
Modrow told reporters his first talks with Kohl marked a ``new
beginning'' in relations between the countries. Kohl accepted an
offer to start negotiations on a treaty to improve relations, and
negotiations will start ``immediately,'' Modrow said.
   Kohl told reporters he hopes such a treaty can be signed by late
spring.
   He later walked through a crowd of several thousand people.
Several signs called for German reunification, with one saying
``Helmut and Hans, make us into one Germany.''
   At an outdoor rally, Kohl drew wild cheers when he referred to
the crowd as ``compatriots'' and said, ``We will not abandon you.''
   ``The emotions are nice, but we have to see what the reality
is,'' he said on West Germany's ZDF television.
   Kohl said he and Modrow would meet again at the end of January
or the beginning of February.
   He said the two sides ``got closer on some issues,'' citing the
East German push for a more formal relationship between the two
states.
   The summit was held in Dresden because West Germany refuses to
acknowledge East Berlin as the capital of a separate and sovereign
East German state.
   East Germany has been seeking a ``Treaty Community,''
establishing fuller ties between East and West Germany, rather than
working to join them.
   Kohl has proposed a 10-point plan aimed at eventual German
reunification.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze today reiterated
Soviet concerns about reunification during a speech to members of
the European Parliament in Belgium, saying there are two good
reasons to oppose it:
   ``We (the Soviet Union) paid the price of 20 million lives for
the existing European stability,'' he said of World War II.
``Furthermore, can the German people themselves forget the national
tragedy brought onto them by Hitlerism?''
   Kohl has made clear that his conservative-led government seeks
eventual reunification of the two German states that have been
divided since 1945.
   But Modrow and many other East Germans active in the
increasingly fragmented political arena have said joining the two
states would be destabilizing for Europe and would result in a
``sellout'' of East German land and industry.
   Reunification has become a major topic of public debate and a
political football in both Germanies ever since a massive popular
uprising forced East Germany to open its borders Nov. 9 and led to
a crumbling of Communist control.
   East Germany's first free elections are now set for May 6.
   Chants of ``Germany, united fatherland'' occasionally disrupted
a candlelight vigil in Leipzig on Monday night. The silent march
was called by church and reform leaders in memory of the victims of
Stalinism.
   The words ``Germany, united fatherland'' were originally part of
the East German national anthem but have been excised since the
early 1970s when Communist officials dropped reunification as a
goal.

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The East German government threw open its borders Thursday and announced that 
its citizens now may travel freely to West Germany. Thousands of jubilant East 
Germans quickly tested the new policy by flocking to the crossing points in 
divided Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
At Checkpoint Charlie, a major crossing point, a huge crowd gathered. As East 
Berliners in small groups made their way through the last barrier to West 
Berlin, the crowds on that side welcomed them with cheers and songs. 
</P>
<P>
East German border guards, who obviously had no instructions on the new border 
policy, generally waved them through with puzzled smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm watching history being made," said one West Berlin bystander. 
</P>
<P>
It was like New Year's Eve or a World Series victory celebration at this and 
other border crossings along the Berlin Wall. Late Thursday and early today, 
hundreds of people climbed atop the grim, grafitti-marred structure, long the 
symbol of the Iron Curtain dividing East and West. Some of them danced for joy 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The new border policy was explained by Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, who 
told a news conference here that East Germans would "promptly" be given permits 
to go to West Germany. He said they could stay there if they wish, or return to 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that the Berlin Wall has no more meaning," an East German official 
said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-awaited day has arrived," declared West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper. 
"The Berlin Wall no longer divides Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds swarmed through the streets long after midnight, auto horns blared, 
police sirens pierced the air, couples walked hand in hand toward the wall and 
people laughed and smiled, offering each other open wine and beer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Some East Germans arriving at border crossings at Invalidenstrasse and 
Prinzstrasse in their small, sputtering Trabant autos were almost prevented 
from entering by the crowds gathered to greet them. But they made their way 
through to West Berlin's bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, many of the East Berliners returned later today to the drab, gray 
Eastern half of the city after sampling the bright lights of the West. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to take a look at the Kurfuerstendamm," said one young man in 
his 20s, as he returned from West Berlin's famous shopping district and headed 
back through the wall to East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
From their side, hundreds of West Berliners crossed into East Berlin, shouting, 
"The wall is gone, the wall is gone!" 
</P>
<P>
A huge crowd gathered next to the Reichstag building at the Brandenburg Gate -- 
the traditional scene of anti-wall demonstrations by West Berliners and the 
place where President John F. Kennedy uttered his famous line, "Ich bin ein 
Berliner." 
</P>
<P>
Many people climbed atop the wall there. At 3 a.m., lights at the gate were 
still blazing as the crowd called out: "Open the gate!" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Berlin, as one analyst here put it: "This news is deeply significant. It 
changes the whole shape of Europe. It will take a while for the import of this 
to sink in." 
</P>
<P>
In the euphoria of Thursday night, there were few formalities for those surging 
through the checkpoints in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning this morning, East Germans will be expected under the new open 
policy to get exit visas for travel abroad, whether permanent emigration or 
just a visit. 
</P>
<P>
They will be allowed to go through any crossing point in the Berlin Wall except 
Checkpoint Charlie, which is reserved for foreigners and military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Whether emigrating or just visiting, they also may enter West Germany through 
the various crossings along the fortified inner-German frontier. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans long have been free to travel to East Germany by simply arriving 
at the border, paying a small fee and exchanging some West German money for 
East German currency. 
</P>
<P>
Schabowski, the spokesman for East Germany's Politburo, was asked about tearing 
down the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the wall does not answer its real purpose," he said. "There is 
still a whole complex of questions that will have to be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the state of the opposing military alliances in Europe -- the 
Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- and progress on arms 
control as factors bearing on the ultimate fate of the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, officials said that though East German emigrants are inundating the 
country, West Germany will accept all East Germans arriving there. 
</P>
<P>
"No one will be turned back," Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble warned that new arrivals can expect poor housing for a long time to 
come -- in what was seen as an effort to discourage the flood of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"For this reason," he said, and because of the cold season, every German from 
East Germany should think carefully before they come here." 
</P>
<P>
A session of the West German Parliament broke into the national anthem on 
hearing the news from East Berlin about opening the borders. 
</P>
<P>
Bundestag member Willy Brandt, the former chancellor who was mayor of West 
Berlin in 1961 when the Berlin Wall went up, wept openly. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning news came after another tumultuous day in East Berlin during the 
three-day meeting of the policy-making Communist Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee announced Thursday that there will be a special 
Parliament meeting Monday to approve the newly appointed reformist Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee also called a rare meeting of the Communist Party 
Conference for Dec. 15-17 to discuss the economic, political and social crises 
swamping the country. 
</P>
<P>
An economic slowdown has been compounded by the flight of about 225,000 East 
Germans so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
West German estimates of those East Germans wishing to depart range from 
400,000 to 1.2 million -- in a nation of 16.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Travel restrictions helped spark the massive demonstrations that brought East 
Germans out in unprecedented numbers onto the streets of East Berlin, Leipzig, 
Dresden, Halle, Schwerin and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
In his briefing on the lifting of travel restrictions, Schabowski said, "The 
decision was taken that makes it possible for all citizens to leave the country 
through East German crossing points." 
</P>
<P>
Schabowski's announcement seemed almost impromptu: He did not read from the 
prepared text he was given shortly before the briefing and seemed vague about 
some details. 
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that East Germans can take their identity cards to their local 
police station and apply for exit visas. Thus, they would not need passports, 
which not many East Germans have. 
</P>
<P>
The exit visas, Schabowski said, will be issued without red tape or demanding a 
reason for the travel. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said those wishing to emigrate would be treated with dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, Schabowski said, will ease East German relations with Communist 
neighbor Czechoslovakia because emigrants no longer will be forced to pass 
through that country en route to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, some opposition elements in East Berlin did not applaud the 
Communist leaders' decision to open up travel to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Peter Schneider, a leader of the small opposition group Democratic 
Awakening, declared: "I doubt that it is a step that will keep the people here. 
I would have preferred it if they had said take your passport and get a visa 
and come back to us. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this step is a sign of the helplessness of our leaders." 
</P>
<P>
But for thousands of Germans, it was a sign of hope. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 a.m., an animal trainer walked through Checkpoint Charlie with a big, 
brown muzzled bear on a leash.

   A huge East German crane began dismantling a
long section of the Berlin Wall next to the Brandenburg Gate on
Monday night and thousands of people cheered.
   More than a mile of the wall is to be taken down between the
Reichstag building and the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point. Most
of it is to be replaced by a fence.
   ``This is terrific,'' said Ralf Lukas, an East German soldier
who operated the crane. ``It had to happen. I was terribly lucky to
be on the job.''
   A crowd of onlookers, estimated by one policeman at 7,000,
cheered as the crane began removing pieces from the top of the wall
and loading them into a truck to be hauled away.
   ``I'm so happy to see the wall come down,'' said Rita Wolter,
20, of East Berlin. ``It was a blight on our country.''
   Others stood on sections of the wall away from the crane,
watching the work under bright floodlights.
   Joachim Damme of West Berlin brought his little girl. ``This is
a historic event. I want to be part of it. I also want to show this
to my daughter.''
   East German officials said they will leave a 200-yard gap in the
wall between the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, but nearby
fences on the eastern side would prevent unobstructed access to the
opening.
   Rainer Menzel, a spokesman for East German border troops, said
the entire wall between the gate and Checkpoint Charlie would be
down by the end of March.
   Since Nov. 9, the East Germans have been opening numerous
passages through the Berlin Wall, although the East Germans require
a check of passports or identity cards at all of them.
   The Reichstag is the expected seat of the Parliament of a united
Germany, although officials say it will take years to renovate the
ornate building.

<TEXT>
   The building of the Berlin Wall began
with a few strands of barbed wire early one Sunday. Hours later,
the citizens of East Berlin became aware they were prisoners, and
they began the protests that rumbled for 28 years.
   On the morning of Aug. 13, 1961, I was awakened in my West
Berlin home and told to go to the border. The Warsaw Pact announced
the Communist regime of East Germany had been authorized to ``take
measures'' to stop the flood of its citizens to the West. I was to
find out what these measures were.
   I made for the Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of the city and the
site of a main crossing point between east and west, and saw
hundreds of men setting up a barbed-wire fence.
   Armed soldiers stood guard. Machine guns were posted in case the
people made a massive attempt to reach the West.
   As my car had British army license plates, I was able to pass
freely through the Brandenburg Gate into the eastern sector.
   From there, I saw that the barbed wire extended as far as I
could see in both directions.
   Squads of ``people's militia'' _ armed factory workers _ stood
by on side streets in case of popular opposition.
   A squadron of Soviet tanks was parked in the Frederichstrasse
train station.
   Hours later, radio and television announced that East Berliners
had been sealed off from the ``devious monopoly capitalists'' in
the West, who had been urging them to go West for a better life.
   I decided to swing through the city and return to the West
through the crossing point at Potsdamer Platz.
   Before World War II, this was the Times Square of Berlin, a
junction of five streets jammed with restaurants, theaters,
nightclubs and cabarets. Now, only the ghostly ruins of bombed
building remained.
   As I drove toward Potsdamer Platz, I noticed a platoon of East
German soldiers commanded by a young officer. I stopped the car
and, pretending ignorance, said: ``Good morning lieutenant, what is
going on?''
   As expected, he was well briefed and started a long explanation
of why it was necessary to cut off the West to ``prevent economic
sabotage by the capitalists.''
   Midway through his speech, he politely asked me to move my car
two or three yards forward.
   I had a good view through the rear-view mirror of soldiers
hauling a roll of barbed wire across the street. My car was the
last to pass over the Potsdamer Platz.
   In time, the wall there became one of the most solid sections.
It was there that Western authorities built a viewing platform used
by visiting dignitaries, including Americans presidents, to peer
into Communist-ruled territory.
   That afternoon and night, crowds gathered in West Berlin to
watch the barbed wire being erected. Some cried, knowing they were
now cut off from friends, relatives and loved ones in the east.
   Over the years, the wall grew into a potent symbol of Communist
oppression, a huge structure of concrete and steel, with
minefields, watch towers and guard dogs.
   At least 200 people were killed trying to escape across it, and
families wept in frustration because they could not visit one
another.
   This weekend, there were tears of joy as the wall started coming
down.

<HEAD>East Germans Welcome West Germans as Visa Restrictions Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of West Germans passed through the
Berlin Wall on Sunday after East Germany marked the holidays by
lifting visa and currency requirements on visitors from the West.
   A spontaneous festival erupted on the East side of the wall's
Brandenburg Gate shortly after midnight as West Berliners poured
through the border crossing.
   The East German government, forced to give in to a pro-democracy
uprising, opened the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 and lifted most
restrictions on East Germans who want to travel to the West.
   Earlier this month, the government lifted currency exchange and
visa requirements on West Germans traveling to the East, fully
opening the border between the nations.
   The new rules went into effect at midnight Saturday, and there
was no shortage of West Germans curious about the East.
   East Berliners tried to return the warm welcome they had
received in West Berlin in November, when bars and cafes stayed
open all night in a riotous celebration of freedom.
   Six weeks later, smiling East Germans rolled out a large keg of
beer, others passed out cognac in the cold drizzle and still others
served as guides for West Berliners, many of whom had crossed into
East Berlin for the first time.
   They strolled down Unter Den Linden, the most elegant boulevard
in East Berlin.
   Berliners from both sides of the crumbling wall broke out in a
chorus of old songs, and couples twirled around to the steady beat
of an organ grinder winding his way around the Brandenburg Gate.
Merrymakers handed flowers to police who grinned in response.
   Others shook metal cans to collect money for medical supplies
for battle-stricken Romania, while the familiar clink of souvenir
seekers chipping away at the wall continued in the background.
   Until Sunday, West Germans were required to obtain a visa to
travel into East Germany and were obliged to change 25 marks, about
$15, each day, a hefty sum for young people and the elderly.
   Now, West Germans simply must show an identity card and fill out
a short form so that the East Germans are able to keep track of the
number of visitors.
   West German border police reported that East Germans greeted
their West German neighbors with flowers and a welcome drink in
numerous villages along the border even before the new rules became
official.
   At many border crossings, East German border guards simply
ignored the rules and allowed West Germans in before the new
regulations went into effect.
   Still, border police reported Sunday morning that the number of
East Germans heading West outstripped the number of West Germans
using their new travel freedoms in the other direction.
   But the number of East Germans traveling to West Germany had
fallen sharply in comparison with previous Sundays. Border police
attributed the drop to the fact that the stores were closed for
Christmas.

   Germany today marked a year since the opening of
the Berlin Wall, a joyful anniversary interlocked with a bitter
one: the night in 1938 when breaking glass heralded the Holocaust,
war and German partition.
   Officials of newly united Germany also warmly welcomed Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who arrived in Bonn today to a 27-man military honor
guard.
   The Soviet president's visit is highly symbolic since his
reforms helped collapse the Iron Curtain and open the Berlin Wall.
   He was to sign a 20-year German-Soviet non-aggression treaty and
was expected to receive financial aid for his nation's troubled
economy.
   Commemorations of the wall's opening were to include the
unveiling of a monument at one of the former crossing points
between East and West Berlin, and a ceremony to honor the more than
200 people killed trying to escape East Germany.
   At the same time, Germany's Jewish community held memorial
ceremonies on the 52nd anniversary of attacks on synagogues, Jewish
homes and businesses known as Kristallnacht - Crystal Night -
because of all the glass shattered by Nazi thugs.
   By the time World War II ended seven years later with Germany's
division, 6 million Jews had been killed, many rounded up in full
view of fellow Germans and transported to death camps.
   Heinz Galinski, a Jewish leader in Germany, said many Germans
``have never accepted Nov. 9 as a day of commemoration'' though it
led to the Holocaust.
   The mayors of West Berlin and East Berlin, Walter Momper and
Tino Schwierzina, said in a joint statement Thursday the two Nov. 9
anniversaries should remind Germans of the need to fight against
oppression of minorities.
   They called for the public to participate in national affairs as
``the best protection against against misuse of state power.''
   Jochen Feilcke, a member of parliament from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats party, called ``completely erroneous''
statements from Communists that former East German officials played
a major role in opening the wall.
   ``Berliners streamed that night to the border crossings and took
over the wall at the Brandenburg Gate,'' he said.
   Last week, a report in the newspaper of the former Communist
Party, Neues Deutschland, said medium-level East German security
officers decided to let the pressing crowds through the wall,
fearing border guards would be killed otherwise.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the then ruling East German
Communist Politburo, also said last year the East German government
had intended to allow its citizens to travel abroad before the wall
opened. Portions of a news conference by Schabowski was planned to
be broadcast over loudspeakers late today in the central square in
East Berlin.
   The Bundesrat, the upper house of Parliament, was to mark the
wall anniversary by holding its first meeting in Berlin in 31
years, moving from Bonn, the federal capital.
   The two Germanys united Oct. 3 into a country of nearly 80
million people, by far the biggest in Europe. Their leaders pledged
repeatedly that the new Germany will not seek to dominate the
continent, nor would it forget the Nazi part of its history.
   Television news programs Thursday ran long recapitulations of
the celebrations that erupted at the Brandenburg Gate last Nov. 9
when it became known that East Germans were free to travel to the
West.
   One year ago, massive pro-democracy demonstrations and the
flight of refugees to the West prompted East Germany's Communist
leaders to begin opening the Berlin Wall. Hundreds of people
spontaneously climbed the 11{-foot wall that symbolized the
divisions of Germany and Europe.
   Shedding tears of happiness, some began using hammers and
chisels on the concrete barrier; soon a thriving business was
started selling chips of the wall as souvenirs.
   Bulldozers have finished removing 81 percent of the wall from
downtown Berlin, and have about two miles to go, officials say.
   Elections in East Germany early this year booted the Communists
from four decades of power, leading to last month's unification.
The first unified German parliamentary elections are Dec. 2.
   The sweeping change, however, has been painful for many former
East Germans as the switch to capitalism has caused inefficient
businesses to shut down, causing rising unemployment.

   Berlin, so long divided by an ugly wall, is
being made whole again to resume its historic role as the capital
of a united Germany.
   Scaffolding covers the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of German unity,
for a facelift expected to take two years.
   There are plans to rebuild the Hotel Adlon, which sat on the
Pariser Platz in front of the towering gate, joined to the American
and British embassies in a sort of three-cornered sandwich.
   Hitler's brass, diplomats, foreign journalists, and everybody
who was anybody in the Berlin of the 1930s mingled at the fabled
Adlon.
   Bodo Freyer, one of East Berlin's leading city planners, is
reponsible for rebuilding old Berlin.
   Until the wall came down in November, Freyer's world ended at
Pariser Platz and the gate, which stands on the line dividing the
city.
   ``We never had to worry about what happened over there,'' he
said pointing at an empty white area denoting West Berlin on his
wall map. ``Now our task is to get the city to grow together
again.''
   To Freyer's delight, his job often takes him to the
once-forbidden zone to work with West Berlin planners on reviving
the central district, much of which is in East Berlin and went to
seed during four decades of communism.
   Less than 10 months after the wall opened, Berlin is booming. An
influx of 1.3 million East Germans has brought its population to
3.4 million.
   Planners don't know how many billions of dollars will be needed
to rebuild the city, but expect the process to last a decade.
   Between the world wars, Berlin was one of Europe's most dynamic
cities: an artistic mecca, a political and financial powerhouse,
and home to refugees escaping Communist upheaval in the east.
   In the 1920s, Marlene Dietrich electrified audiences in the
musical show ``Something's in the Air.''
   Great minds were drawn to Berlin. Albert Einstein taught physics
here, Jean-Paul Sartre came from Paris to philosophize, Vladimir
Nabokov wandered the streets in exile from Russia and wrote novels.
   The rise of the Nazis in the 1930s changed Berlin forever.
   Most of the Jewish community, the largest in Germany, fled or
perished in the Holocaust, and the world identified the city with
evil.
   When the Nazis cracked down on nonconformists, Berlin's artists
and independent intellectuals deserted the city.
   After the war, divided and desolate, Berlin became a backwater.
   West Berlin was an outpost of democracy in a sea of communism.
So many people fled to it from surrounding East German territory
that the Communist regime built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to keep
them in.
   The wall builders disregarded streets and subway lines, creating
an artificial strip through the city.
   ``It's a unique situation,'' Freyer said. ``A building boom will
occur to fix what happened due to the division.''
   During World War II, bombs razed the Adlon and most other
buildings in the city's historic center.
   Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's most famous prewar square, was cut in
two by the wall and became a vast no-man's land.
   A platform at Potsdamer Platz where U.S. presidents once peered
into East Berlin was an early Cold War symbol. It has been taken
down.
   Daimler-Benz, the industrial giant, wants the choicest piece of
real estate on Potsdamer Platz for a new headquarters.
   Foreign countries hope to recover embassy sites confiscated by
East Germany after the war.
   ``We have the right to the land where our embassy was before the
war,'' a senior French diplomat said. ``We would have to entirely
rebuild because it's grass now.''
   The French Embassy was across the Pariser Platz from the U.S.
Embassy and the Adlon.
   On the West Berlin side of the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag
waits silently. On Dec. 2, the two German legislatures will decide
whether to return a united German parliament to its original home.
   On Sunday mornings, groups of soccer players gather for pickup
games on the green expanse in front of the Reichstag, where Hitler
once addressed throngs of supporters.
   An army of rabbits that lived in the deserted area behind it has
invaded the meadows of the Tiergarten across the street.

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, winning a more rousing welcome than he ever 
received at home, promised here Tuesday to support the "peaceful revolution" in 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In return, East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow, after his first meeting with 
the chancellor, declared that Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate will be opened 
by Christmas. Modrow also said East Germany will allow visa-free travel for 
West Germans into East Germany, beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl was wildly cheered by an estimated 40,000 people, who chanted, "Helmut, 
Helmut, unity, unity." A banner across a blackened church tower proclaimed: 
"Helmut: With You to Unity." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators mostly carried the West German black, red and gold flag, which 
far outnumbered the few East German banners. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Modrow, the reformist prime minister who was Communist party chief in 
Dresden before moving to Berlin, met Tuesday morning. Later, Kohl and his aides 
said Bonn will offer East Germany at least 10 billion Deutsche marks, or $5.8 
billion, in credits to revive the deteriorating economy. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl declared: "In this difficult situation for East Germany, we will not leave 
our countrymen in East Germany in the lurch." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, he attempted to walk a fine line between encouraging 
German reunification and being polite to his host, who opposes German unity. He 
said, "My aim remains -- if history allows -- the unity of the German nation." 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said he will meet Modrow early next year and hopes to sign a 
treaty leading to cooperation in economic matters as well as in transport and 
social policy. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, East Germany's Modrow told the news conference: "The existence of 
East Germany is something we will not give up. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree on our responsibility for peace in Europe. Our decision to build 
closer cooperation step by step is a point of departure that all our neighbors 
-- ours and yours -- can trust." 
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that all political prisoners in East Germany will be freed 
soon, perhaps by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow did not specify the date when the East Germans will open the Berlin Wall 
at the Brandenburg Gate, the city's most famous symbol, but he indicated that 
it would be for pedestrian traffic only. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Kohl placed a wreath at the ruins of the Church of Our Lady, bombed like 
most of Dresden during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
To a crowd that cheered almost every line, Kohl, who called those at the 
gathering "my compatriots," said events in East Germany represented the first 
peaceful revolution in German history. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "Self-determination makes sense for Germany only if we do not 
neglect the security rights of others. The house of Germany must be built under 
a European roof." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl ended his speech in the chilly dusk with the words: "God bless our German 
fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
During Kohl's various appearances, some members of the crowd taunted one 
another, because many were for a reunited Germany, while others insist on 
keeping East Germany a separate and socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, anti-unity demonstrators marched through the city center 
chanting the slogan: "Never Again Germany." They made a point of waving East 
German flags, which bear the Communist Party's insignia. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were both countries' economics ministers, who are 
expected to begin drafting agreements under which West Germany will begin 
underwriting part of the East German economy. Bonn Economics Minister Helmut 
Haussmann and East German Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil said they expect 
trade and investment to rise sharply next year. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Dresdener Bank, West Germany's second-largest, revealed plans 
to open a branch office here in Dresden, where the company was founded more 
than 100 years ago.

GUARDS WHO KILLED WILL BE PROSECUTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The statement -- on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the erection of the
Berlin Wall -- reflects the changes in this country. Berliner Zeitung,
formerly an East German communist newspaper that reported dutifully how
important the Berlin Wall was as a barrier against fascism, devoted an
eight-page section Monday to the wall's history and the emotions that
accompanied its opening.;    Brandenburg Gate's new role;  The 200-year-old
Brandenburg Gate stood just on the east side of the 100-mile-long wall and
became part of the symbolism of divided Berlin, Germany and Europe. Now it is
refurbished and ready to take on a role as an east-west traffic artery.;   
Today, Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen will lay a wreath at the place where one
of the most heart-wrenching dramas occurred at the wall, in 1962, when
18-year-old Peter Fechter was shot trying to escape. He was left to bleed to
death.;    The Berliner Zeitung on Monday reprinted the death notice for the
last victim killed at the wall, Chris Gueffroy, who died Feb. 2, 1989. The
family said in the notice that he had died in a "tragic accident.";    Border
troops face charges;  A popular revolution forced the barricade open Nov. 9,
1989.;    Erich Honecker, who oversaw construction of the wall in 1961 before
he became head of the Communist Party, escaped to Moscow in March and will not
be prosecuted. But several former East German border troops already face
charges, and prosecutors are assembling evidence against other Communist
leaders of East Germany who issued the shoot-to-kill orders.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Authorities Report Vandalism, Neo-Fascism Spreading in East
Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vandals and New Year's Eve revelers
extensively damaged Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and neo-fascist
slogans were smeared on monuments in East German cities,
authorities reported Tuesday.
   Officials said one man died and about 300 people were hurt in
holiday celebrations along the Berlin Wall, the official ADN news
agency reported. They said many were treated for cuts from
shattered champagne bottles and for broken bones.
   More than 500,000 Germans gathered along the Berlin Wall to
cheer the arrival of 1990. Hundreds scaled the towering Brandenburg
Gate and nearby structures.
   The bronze chariot and horses atop the monument were damaged and
some sections will have to be replaced, said Horst Weiss of the
national office for protection of memorials.
   A laurel wreath affixed to a statue of the Greek goddess Nike
was stolen, and someone tried to break off an arm, Weiss told ADN.
   East Berlin police spokesman Michael Braemer told The Associated
Press the death of a 24-year-old West Berlin man found in East
Berlin was under investigation. Authorities first thought he died
when scaffolding holding up an outdoor projection screen collapsed
under the weight of revelers shortly after 1 a.m. on New Year's.
But Braemer said he may have fallen from a tree along Unter den
Linden.
   ADN said neo-Nazi groups smeared slogans on memorials in other
cities and some physical attacks were reported.
   In Pirna and Goerlitz near Dresden, ``Hitler Lives,'' and ``We
are here _ REP,'' the abbreviation for West Germany's ultraright
Republican Party, were scrawled on walls and windows, ADN said.
   In Goerlitz ``Foreigners Out'' and ``Jews Out'' were painted on
structures and a memorial to those persecuted under the Nazis was
daubed with swastikas, the agency said.
   Anti-communist demonstrators in Halle spraypainted ``SED _ No
Thank You'' on memorials, referring to the East German Communist
Party.
   ``Skinheads'' and neo-Nazi youths carrying homemade weapons
threatened passers-by in Erfurt and two people were hurt
confronting them, ADN said.
   The report said some of those arrested said they supported the
Republicans.
   ADN said Communist Party groups planned to protest in East
Berlin this week the recent spate of neo-Nazi activity in East
Germany.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: BERLIN EXPERIENCE WAS A CHIP OFF THE EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The excited passengers dutifully assembled at London's Gatwick Airport for the 
6 a.m. Caledonian Airways charter flight No. 7320. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 day-trippers had each paid 100 (about $160 U.S.) for the round-trip 
tour to Berlin, and they all waited anxiously for the wide-body plane to leave 
the gate. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, as each passenger put his or her carry-on bags through the X-ray 
machines, a security guard laughed and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Hammer . . . chisel . . . hammer . . . hammer . . . chisel," the guard said, 
as he monitored the screen and stopped each bag. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had plenty of these here today," he said as he tucked the implements 
into a red pouch and had passengers fill out the "Declaration of Surrender of 
Prohibited Articles" form. "We're planning to give a prize to the 200th person 
who arrives with a hammer and chisel." 
</P>
<P>
Once checked in, the passengers eagerly awaited their turn to board the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But alas, there would be a delay. After 40 minutes an announcement said: 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the inordinate number of hammers and chisels brought on in carry-on 
bags," said a humorless woman on the public-address system, "we will be delayed 
while they are all stowed in the cargo department." 
</P>
<P>
The airplane cabin erupted in embarrassed laughter. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later we left for Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Following the incredible events of Nov. 9, when the 27-mile wall that runs 
through Berlin was opened, the city has become the hottest tourist destination 
in Europe. It seems that everyone wants to visit and cut out their chunk of the 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, pilot Tony Meredith descended from 31,000 to 9,500 feet and 
began his run through the Berlin Air Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
He dipped the wings of the L-1011 slowly from side to side so passengers could 
see the cities of West and East Berlin below. 
</P>
<P>
At Berlin-Tegel Airport, the confiscated hammers and chisels failed to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers boarded prearranged tour buses that would take them into East 
Berlin. I grabbed a taxi with some friends and headed for the Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
The streets were jammed with cars all pointed in the same direction. The cab 
driver turned up the volume on his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone goes to the wall. Ich bin ein Berliner! It is now one big party," he 
said, as he made a sharp turn and the Mercedes cab passed by the Reichstag 
(Hitler's wartime headquarters) and brought us in front of the daunting, 
graffiti-covered walls. 
</P>
<P>
At the Brandenburg Gate, throngs of people were singing, playing musical 
instruments or buying souvenirs from hastily constructed stands. Freiheit 
(freedom) T-shirts ($20), buttons ($2), hats ($10), pins ($4), bumper stickers 
($2) and coffee mugs ($6) were for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the wall surrounding the gate, which remains in East German hands, East 
German guards stood their watch. 
</P>
<P>
The crescendo of singing and music was matched by the sounds of hundreds of 
snapping camera shutters. Nearby, on a specially devised press stand 
overlooking the wall, two TV cameramen maintained their own sentinel on the 
chance that something interesting would happen on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
But about the only thing of interest they could photograph were some of the 
East German guards -- once the abominable "no" men -- standing on the wall, 
tapping their feet to the sounds of the Western music. 
</P>
<P>
We headed along the wall to Potsdamer Platz, where the first section of the 
27-mile wall had been erected. Almost everyone was chipping away and those who 
weren't were trying to catch little bits of shattered concrete as it flew off 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The hammer and sickle had been replaced by the hammer and chisel. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more enterprising visitors brought makeshift ladders, larger 
chisels, gloves, goggles and small wheelbarrows to haul away chunks of 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Others rented chisels and hammers -- $3 each for 20 minutes. Some even sold 
larger chunks of the wall -- $1 to $8 each, depending upon size. 
</P>
<P>
Left untouched for the moment was one small piece of the wall upon which was 
painted the most appropriate, if not prophetic message: "One Day, All This Will 
Be Art." 
</P>
<P>
A hundred yards away, Ian Leong, a New Yorker who now lives in Bangkok, was 
chipping away at the wall and placing the concrete nuggets in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
"We've managed to get a bag full," he said. "We've only come here for a week. 
It was an opportunity you couldn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
One American tourist took his two children to a graffiti-covered spot in the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Stand back, kids," he said as he brandished his pickaxe-hammer. More of the 
Berlin Wall began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Toward Checkpoint Charlie a man sat astride the top using a big rock to smash 
pieces of the rounded, pipe-like cowling. People below stopped to pick up the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
At last we made it to Checkpoint Charlie, the largest and best known of the 
border crossing points. Hundreds of people stood in line waiting to go to East 
Germany. Another line of small, ugly East German Trabant cars, each belching 
its own obnoxious clouds of fumes, waited to drive into the West. 
</P>
<P>
Soon it was time to head back to the airport and our flight to London. 
</P>
<P>
Once airborne, the passengers pulled out and compared their chunks of the wall. 
Others regaled fellow passengers with their adventures of the previous seven 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible," said Teresa Soriano, a Georgetown University student on 
holiday. "We went into East Berlin and the guards were friendly. We gave some a 
dollar and they gave us a piece of the wall from their side. Another sold us a 
chunk for a chocolate bar." 
</P>
<P>
One group of British youngsters rented an Audi at the airport and drove it 
across the border and 20 miles into East Germany to have a look. They made it 
back to the flight just before the cabin crew shut the door. 
</P>
<P>
Caledonian co-pilot Peter Brent joked about the weighty return. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we don't have too much of the Berlin Wall tucked in your bags and 
pockets," he said. "We tried chipping ourselves; it's a lot more solid than it 
looked." 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Parker, an assistant director from "L.A. Law," brought back a huge chunk 
of the wall she bought for $20, as well as a handful of souvenir badges and 
about half a dozen commemorative T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity I couldn't miss," she said. "The chance to chip away a 
piece of history was just too much. These will undoubtedly be some of the most 
unusual Christmas presents I have ever given." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Naismith, the London-based director of the International Internship 
Program for James Madison University, was also an enthusiastic visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fascinating experience," Naismith said. "It was festive. The East 
Germans were anxious to meet people. A young East German woman came up to us to 
talk. She said that last week in her classes the teachers simply canceled the 
economics and planning courses, saying they were no longer valid." 
</P>
<P>
GTF Tours (184-186 Kensington Church St., Nottinghill Gate, London W8, England) 
is continuing its Berlin Airlift service. It may also begin similar trips to 
Prague. 
</P>
<P>
American Express in London offers weekend trips to Berlin from about $385 U.S. 
for two nights (must include Saturday night) to about $775 for five nights. Pan 
Am also offers a tour to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
There are also hotel discounts. "Dial Berlin" is an association of local hotel 
operators. It has a U.S. toll-free number: (800) 237-5469.

EAST BLOC: HE AND KOHL PLAN TO MEET SOON. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FLOOD INTO WEST 
BERLIN FROM ACROSS THE WALL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared Saturday that he will soon meet 
with new East German leader Egon Krenz, with Krenz insisting that reunification 
of divided Germany will "not be on the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of East Germans flooded into West Berlin, 
turning the city center into one enormous pedestrian mall. 
</P>
<P>
And Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a message to President Bush on 
Saturday declaring his support of the East German move to open its border with 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Kohl said he told Krenz during a telephone conversation Saturday that 
he welcomes the Communist regime's decision Thursday to open the tightly 
guarded frontier. The two are expected to meet later this month or in early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Krenz said of the coming meeting: "I made no secret of the 
fact that the question of reunification is not up for discussion at all. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern as a representative of East Germany is to stress there are two 
sovereign German states that must get along well with each other, and I will do 
my best to make sure that this will work even better." 
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Kohl and Krenz are expected to discuss the West German 
chancellor's offer to provide massive economic aid if the new Communist regime 
carries out promised free elections and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Following his conversation with Krenz, Kohl told a news conference the two 
agreed to discuss how to improve conditions in East Germany "so that they can 
feel comfortable in their homeland and not want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I expressly told (Krenz) that it is the goal of our policy that people are 
able to remain in their homelands," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl met Krenz's ousted predecessor, Erich Honecker, in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
After speaking with Krenz, Kohl flew to Warsaw to resume his official visit to 
Poland that was interrupted by last week's startling turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
All along the two nations' border Saturday, lines of cars many miles long 
waited to cross directly into West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials said Saturday that 1.6 million East Germans had been 
issued travel visas since Thursday. But West German Interior Minister Wolfgang 
Schaeuble said that of the hundreds of thousands who had entered since about 9 
p.m. Thursday, only about 5% said they wished to remain. 
</P>
<P>
All day and evening Saturday, East Germans strolled the streets of West Berlin 
and West German cities, usually carrying plastic bags donated by supermarkets 
to haul what they could afford in the shops. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, the visitors were easily recognizable among the more formally 
dressed West Berliners taking their Saturday coffee-and-cakes because of their 
casual dress -- invariably blue-gray jackets and stone-washed jeans and white 
sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of thousands of family groups was lighthearted but quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The main exception was an incident at the Brandenburg Gate that stands in East 
Berlin just beyond the wall. 
</P>
<P>
There, young people from West Berlin climbed on the wall, which lies in East 
German territory, and taunted the guards with calls for total destruction of 
the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
They smashed a hole in the concrete, and the guards responded with a burst of 
water cannon. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Eberswald Street border crossing, East German crews using a crane 
worked all night to remove concrete wall sections. By early morning, they were 
busy putting the finishing touches on a ramp for cars and pedestrians to use. 
</P>
<P>
Another construction crew was hard at work Saturday preparing the way for a 
major new crossing at Potsdamerplatz, once the busiest intersection in Europe 
until extinguished by war and the wall running across it. 
</P>
<P>
On the West side, an asphalt road, still steaming, was being laid to connect 
with the Berlin network, and similar measures were being undertaken behind the 
wall -- which itself will soon be breached. 
</P>
<P>
An East German border guard at the Eberswald crossing told reporters Saturday 
morning: "It was a beautiful moment when the first people walked through. Now 
we are turning this into just a normal street." 
</P>
<P>
The gap in the wall was clearly marked because the graffiti on the West side 
abruptly ended -- replaced by the bare, gray interior walls of the East Berlin 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The last piece of graffiti read in English: "Mom, why is this wall here?" 
</P>
<P>
An East German construction engineer, Peter Niekamp, who by virtue of 
membership in the Communist Party was able to visit relatives in San Francisco 
a week before that city's earthquake, observed: "We're having our own 
earthquake here, but it's a good one. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to imagine this happening a few weeks ago, really impossible." 
</P>
<P>
As he watched the mass of people swarm by, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"We have some very big problems in our very small country, and I hope that all 
these people will come back. 
</P>
<P>
After the East Germans moved through the new gap in the wall, they walked a 
block down the street, where they were greeted by an A&amp;P supermarket van. 
Willing helpers passed out plastic bags with a pound of coffee and a large bar 
of chocolate, precious items in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients were supposed to show East German identity cards, but nobody was 
checking. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the street, at a main intersection, East Germans stood in long 
lines outside several branch banks, specially opened on Saturday, to receive 
the traditional "welcome gift" of 100 marks (about $60) that the city hands out 
to German visitors from the East. They waited three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people feel ashamed about accepting this," said a West Berliner who 
talked with some of the East Berliners. "But their own marks are worth only a 
tenth of the West mark, so they would have a hard time buying anything here, 
even a cheap meal." 
</P>
<P>
The famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra announced a free concert with 
conductor Daniel Barenboim, and the West German Opera here presented a free 
performance of "The Magic Flute." 
</P>
<P>
Another performance was held at the Friedrichstrasse crossing point. There, 
world-renowned Soviet-born cellist Mstislav Rostropovic gave an impromptu 
concert in front of a graffiti-covered section of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
And on bustling Wuerttembergerische Strasse a 24-year-old visitor from Potsdam, 
East Germany, gave birth to a girl on the sidewalk, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Rides on the subways and elevated trains were free, as were city buses, which 
were implemented by tour coaches and buses from Hamburg city. 
</P>
<P>
Inching up in the queue outside a bank off the main Kurfuerstendamm avenue, a 
family of four adults, all medical workers from Leipzig, were cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
One, Annette Schultz, explained that they had taken one of several special 
trains from East Germany's second-largest city at 2 a.m.. Saturday, arriving in 
Berlin at 7 a.m. and crossing the wall. 
</P>
<P>
They were looking forward to a day of shopping -- or at least window shopping 
-- because the lack of goods is what has driven many people in the Leipzig, 
Karl Marx Stadt and Dresden area to flee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience so far been beautiful; the city much cleaner than Leipzig with 
fine public transport. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be going back tonight," she said. "I don't think many people will stay 
over here permanently. We would like to come back again soon."

<HEAD>Minimum Hard-Currency Exchange Rule Dropped for Foreigners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The warming trend between East and West has
had a positive side-effect for foreigners, with visitors no longer
required to hand over a minimum of $14 for each day of their stay
in East Germany
   Under an aid agreement with Bonn, East Germany has ended its
age-old ``Zwangsumtausch,'' or the ``forced exchange'' that aimed
to increase the socialist state's hard-currency coffers.
   Officials from the two nations announced in December that West
Germans would no longer be required to make the minimum conversion
after Jan. 1. The extension of the benefit to other foreigners has
come as a surprise.
   ``We've heard that was the case, but we have nothing official on
it yet,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav Verner commented when
asked if U.S. authorities had been informed of the change.
   Tourists from the United States, France, Great Britain and other
nations required to enter East Germany through Checkpoint Charlie
have found empty money exchange booths at that border crossing.
   No public announcement of the policy change has been made, but
East German officials confirmed Friday that all visitors can enter
free of charge.
   Franz Koeckerbauer, spokesman for the Finance Ministry, said
border authorities stopped demanding the exchange minimum on Dec.
23 when the Berlin Wall, which was built in 1961, was opened at the
historic Brandenburg Gate. Hundreds of thousands poured through the
new opening in the wall to make the towering gate accessible to
pedestrians from East and West Berlin.
   East Germany's ADN news agency reported that 3.7 million people
passed between East and West Berlin over the New Year's holiday
weekend, although it did not indicate if that figure included an
estimate of the thousands who simply scaled the graffiti-splattered
wall rather than using designated border crossings.
   Bernd Schroeter, a spokesman for East Germany's state bank, said
the decision to suspend minimum currency exchange requirements for
all visitors was connected with the agreement reached with West
Germany in early December.
   Under the deal agreed to by Communist Premier Hans Modrow and
Rudolf Seiters, the chief of staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bonn
is financing a special hard-currency fund for East Germans in
exchange for ending the conversion minimum for West Germans.
   Schroeter said the West German measures compensating East
Germany for the lost revenue extended to the entire fund, not just
the revenue from West Germans.
   Western diplomats estimate that East Germany earned between $294
million and $441 million annually from forced conversion.
   Schroeter said he could not estimate what percentage of the
total came from foreigners other than West Germans.
   Visitors are forbidden to take East German marks with them when
they leave the country, so in the past much of the currency was
left behind with friends or relatives, or squandered at overpriced
restaurants.
   Under the new currency exchange rules, foreigners can change
their hard currencies at a rate that gives them three times as many
East German marks as under the old system _ but only if they want
to.

<HEAD>Krenz Says Dismantling of Berlin Wall Depends on West Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz, in
an interview published Saturday, declared his country's allegiance
to socialism and said dismantling of more of the Berlin Wall
depends on West Germany.
   Krenz told London's Financial Times that a decision whether to
open the Brandenburg Gate will be based on cooperation from West
Germany and West Berlin.
   The newspaper quoted Krenz as saying, ``At the moment, we are
not planning to open it (the Brandenburg Gate). Whether we open it,
and when we open it, depends not on us but on the other side.''
There have been rumors that the crossing at the gate would soon be
open.
   The Financial Times reported Krenz said that although East
Germany opened its western border to virtually unrestricted travel
two weeks ago, the main Berlin Wall will remain in place to prevent
unification of East and West Germany.
   ``The falling away of the border would have significant
consequences for carrying out certain plans for reunification,''
Krenz said, and at the present ``the existence of two German states
is a question of stability and peace in Europe.''
   He also was quoted as saying it was unlikely that planned free
elections in East Germany could be held befsdore the end of 1990.
   Krenz became party chief Oct. 18 when hard-line leader Erich
Honecker was forced to resign.
   The Financial Times said the interview was conducted Friday in
Krenz's office at his party headquarters in East Berlin.
   It reported he criticized what he called West German efforts to
force East Germany into market-oriented reform in exchange for aid
and said, ``I cannot imagine East Germany as a capitalist country.''
   The newspaper said Krenz had these replies to questions on other
issues:
   East Germany's interest in joining the European Economic
Community is ``a difficult question to judge today.'' It is ``a
question ... to do with the common European house which we all want
to build.''
   East and West Germany could move toward a form of confederation
if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact alliance
dissolve.
   ``The question of reunification at the moment is not on the
agenda because it would totally change the power relationships in
Europe.''
   One reason for East Germany's economic difficulties is adherence
to an administrative system inherited from the Stalinist past.
   ``We are ready to take advice about making our state more
effective and attractive. But we are not ready to be dictated to
with conditions from any other country _ especially the Federal
Republic (West Germany).''

Czechoslovakia's new President Vaclav Havel, on a quick trip to the two 
Germanys, declared Tuesday that Europe need have no fear of a reunited Germany 
-- so long as it is democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who assumed the presidency last Friday, met with East German leaders in 
East Berlin and told reporters afterward that Germany "can be as large as it 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
He also made a surprise visit to the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and 
said he was "amazed that the wall was still standing." According to Havel, the 
acting East German head of state, Manfred Gerlach, said that the wall soon will 
be coming down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that if he had any problems we could send some independent 
Czechoslovak workers to help -- free of charge," Havel added. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach also told the West German newspaper Bild that the wall will soon come 
down. "We are dismantling it," the newspaper quoted Gerlach as saying. "It has 
become superfluous. It will be replaced by ordinary border markers." 
</P>
<P>
Bild said Gerlach had not set a date for tearing down the wall, but had 
indicated that the matter will be taken up soon by his government. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said that the two Germanys should not decide on their future until after 
the euphoria brought on by their recently acquired freedom dies down, and he 
added that they should decide in consultation with the rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Democratic awareness and a democratic system," he said, "are more important 
than the possibility that it might become one nation of 60 or 80 million 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, accompanied by Prime Minister Marian Calfa and Foreign Minister Jiri 
Deinstbier, spent four hours in East Berlin, talking with Prime Minister Hans 
Modrow and other officials, before flying to Munich and a meeting with West 
German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he looks for good relations between Bonn and Prague and went on to 
say, "When I look at the weather here in Munich today -- bright sunshine -- it 
is a good omen for the 1990s that are now beginning." 
</P>
<P>
He said there would be no concrete agreements in his meeting with Havel and 
that "the most important thing today is getting to know one another." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, a popular hero of the November uprising that brought down 
Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership, said he expects East Germany and West 
Germany to agree on their future and that "it must be part of a whole European 
process." 
</P>
<P>
"It must be worked out by negotiations, not through wild gestures," he said. 
"Much of Czechoslovakia borders on East or West Germany; Germany virtually 
surrounds us. It must free its neighbors of fear, specifically the fear of a 
greater Germany."

   West Germany today offered massive financial aid
to East Germany if the Communist nation revamps its centralized
economy, and West Berlin's mayor warned of economic problems caused
by the newly opened borders.
   Also today, East Germany's new premier called for a coalition
government but gave no indication the opposition will be part in
it, despite widespread protests pressing for an end to the
Communist monopoly on power.
   Hans Modrow, considered a reformer, also said the Berlin Wall,
though open to travel, must remain standing to keep AIDS, crime and
other Western problems out of his Communist country, a newspaper
said today.
   A leader of East Germany's biggest opposition group, New Forum,
said today that the movement could work with a revamped Communist
Party but that naming Modrow premier was not enough.
   Also today, the official East German news agency ADN reported
that the government was considering opening part of the Berlin Wall
near the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passage between East and
West Berlin. The gate, a huge columned monument, is one of the
city's best-known symbols.
   Before East Germany opened its borders, the gate had been a
major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to travel to
the West.
   Since the opening of East Germany's borders last week, there has
been growing speculation and concern about the implications for the
East German and West German economies.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, in announcing
the aid package today, compared his conditional offer to the
Marshall Plan put together by the United States to help Europe
recover from World War II destruction.
   Haussmann did not name a figure for the proposed aid, and said
the plan would be useless if East Germany did not carry out a
``thorough change'' of its troubled centrally planned economy.
   Speaking to reporters in Bonn, Haussmann said reforms promised
by East Germany's new Communist Party leader Egon Krenz had so far
led to more questions than answers.
   The minister said the aid plan being offered by Bonn would
include massive investments in East Germany and joint ventures, as
well as revamping East Germany's outdated communications and
transport system.
   East Germany's Communist governments in the past have flatly
ruled out free-market principles in the Socialist state.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper urged the federal government to
meet with East German officials to discuss ``pressing economic
problems'' created by the sudden opening of East Germany's borders.
   Among the issues mentioned by Momper were currency problems,
traffic and other economic problems.
   Modrow was chosen Monday in a session of unprecedented
liveliness in East Germany's Parliament. Lawmakers, long
subservient to the Communist leadership, voted by secret ballot for
the first time and endorsed opposition calls for free elections.
They also elected their first non-Communist Parliament speaker.
   Some deputies even called for stripping the constitution of a
clause that designates the country ``socialist.''
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland
acknowledged today the country is in a ``deep crisis,'' but is
experiencing an ``awakening'' leading toward change.
   Modrow, 61, is an anti-establishment Communist figure who built
his power base from his former position as Dresden's Communist
Party chief. He replaced Willi Stoph, who resigned last week along
with his entire 44-member Cabinet.
   The new premier supports step-by-step economic reforms,
including the scaling down of East Germany's ponderous government
bureaucracy.
   Still, Modrow said the government has no intention of tearing
down the Berlin Wall, despite carving new passages through it for
the past five days in an effort to halt an exodus of refugees and
growing public unrest.
   ``In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases of
AIDS and drugs are virtually unknown. Our people are asking
themselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is,'' West
Germany's Bild newspaper quoted Modrow as saying.
   He said doing away with the barrier completely could cause
``chaos,'' echoing the Communist line that the wall was designed to
protect East Germany from threats of the West.
   Modrow is to present his Cabinet on Friday. The official ADN
news agency quoted him as saying Monday night that the country
needs a ``real coalition government.''
   ``This will naturally be a broader cooperation within our
alliance,'' he said, referring to four small Communist-aligned
parties that have had Cabinet positions in the past but never
important ones.
   There was no indication he intended to offer Cabinet ministries
to opposition leaders.
   The election of Modrow came as hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators gathered around the nation, spurred by last week's
opening of East Germany's borders with the West. They shouted
anti-Communist slogans and demanded an end to the party's monopoly
on power.
   In the city of Leipzig, about 300,000 people paraded through the
streets in what has become a Monday night ritual, chanting ``We are
the people!'' Protesters shouted `Lazy bunch!'' outside the local
headquarters of the secret police.
   Juergen Tallig, the Leipzig spokesman for New Forum, told West
Germany's Hesse state radio today, ``I can imagine cooperating with
a reformed Communist party.''
   He praised Modrow as a ``competent politician'' but said,
``There are still too many people in top positions with whom
dialogue is not possible.''
   Krenz permanently opened East Germany's borders Friday in an
attempt to stop hundreds of thousands of East Germans from fleeing
West and to buy time for his promised reforms.
   The gamble appears to have paid off. The official ADN news
agency reported that more than 5 million visas had been issued
since Thursday, but that only about 10,000 people applied to
emigrate.
   Monday's frequently uproarious parliamentary session was the
first translation of East Germany's euphoria into concrete
political action.
   During the meeting, some parliamentarians blamed the previous
party and state leadership for the economic and social morass that
has engulfed this nation of 16.5 million.
   Party leader Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 at the height of
the exodus, and there have been calls for the entire party Central
Committee to step down.
   The new speaker of Parliament is Guenther Maleuda. The
Communists did not field a challenger to his candidacy. Maleuda
heads the Democratic Peasants, one of four non-Communist parties
that had been allowed to exist in exchange for accepting Communist
supremacy.

   Americans, Italians and others clambered up the
Berlin Wall on Friday to join Germans from both sides of the divide
in an exuberant celebration of East Germany's newly opened borders.
   ``I've seen this wall many times, and I'm glad to see it break
open,'' said Rick Mike, an American soldier who joined the hundreds
atop the graffiti-covered concrete barrier at the city's hallmark
Brandenburg Gate.
   ``It should have happened a long time ago, this freedom _ that's
what we're here for,'' said Mike, who is based in West Berlin.
   Two jackbooted Soviet soldiers standing guard at the massive
Soviet World War II memorial less than 200 yards to the west of the
wall watched impassively.
   Champagne bottles littered the base of the wall. On the other
side, scores of unarmed East German soldiers _ some grim, others
bemused _ kept an eye on the throng on top of the barrier. A nearby
brass band drowned out shouts and the milling crowd paralyzed local
traffic on the wall's west side.
   The celebrations began late Thursday when Communist authorities
threw open East German borders for the first time since the Berlin
Wall rose in 1961. On Friday, authorities said they would forever
lift all travel restrictions and begin knocking down a portion of
the wall.
   Mike, 20, and another American soldier, Edward Tolentino, 23, of
Chicago, said neither they nor the city had slept since the first
wave of East Germans began pouring into West Berlin.
   ``I worked midnight shift last night, and I'm going to work
midnight shift tonight, and I don't think I'm going to get much
rest in between,'' said Mike, of Waltham, Mass.
   Robert Davidson, a modern dancer from Seattle, said friends had
told him of East Germany's decision to permit its citizens
unrestricted travel abroad, ``and I still don't believe it.''
   ``I was sure the wall was here to stay at least till the turn of
the century,'' but the decision to permit free travel for East
Germans had now changed his mind, he said.
   Sergio Lauria of Rome said he felt anticipation mixed with the
joy of celebrants atop and near the wall.
   ``People are waiting for something,'' he said. ``This thing is
not over yet.''
   His neighbor, Giorgio Puzzilli, said he felt fortunate to be
visiting Berlin at this historic time.
   ``This is a very important moment,'' he said. ``You have to feel
for these people, who have been waiting for such a long time.''
   Jozsef Dudas, of Miskolc, Hungary, said he felt special empathy
for the East Germans.
   ``If it weren't for Hungary, this wouldn't have happened,'' he
said, alluding to his country's initial role in the exodus of East
Germans wanting to settle in West Germany.
   Since Hungary threw open its western border to Austria Sept. 10
to East Germans wishing to turn their back on the East bloc, more
than 50,000 of them have used Hungary as a springboard to the West.
Others have used Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   At Checkpoint Charlie, three miles down the wall, officials lost
count of how many East Berliners had crossed into West Berlin since
the border was opened. ``It must be tens of thousands,'' said one
West German border official. Early morning reports in West Berlin
spoke of about 50,000 people.
   East Berlin construction workers still wearing their hard hats
drank beer and toasted their first experience in West Berlin,
watched by about 200 curious Westerners.
   There were jubilant scenes at other border crossings and East
and West Berliners joined in a never-ending party they had been
awaiting for decades.
   The wall, which has divided Berlin and symbolized the division
of East and West for decades, was built to stop the flow of East
Germans fleeing to the West _ 2.5 million from 1949 until Aug. 13,
1961.
   More than 20,000 Berliners gathered Friday outside the
Schoeneberg City Hall in West Berlin, where President John F.
Kennedy proclaimed ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' on June 26, 1963.
   ``There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the
future. Let them come to Berlin,'' Kennedy said. ``And there are
some who say in Europe and elsewhere, `We can work with the
Communists.' Let them come to Berlin.
   ``And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism
is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Let
them come to Berlin.
   ``Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect.
But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to
prevent them from leaving us.''
   Every president since has repeated Kennedy's plea to tear the
wall down.
   Former West German Chanellor Willy Brandt, mayor of West Berlin
when the wall went up in 1961, said prospects for German unity had
taken a major step forward with East Germany's opening of its
borders.
   ``The Berlin Wall will come down, and Berlin will live,'' Brandt
said.

   Germany united with a burst of color under a clear
moonlit sky Wednesday to close out the most festive chapter of a
remarkable year.
   The two sides of Berlin were linked by a river of people that
stretched from Alexanderplatz, East Berlin's central square, to the
historic Branderburg Gate more than a half-mile away.
   Crowds estimated at more than 1 million swarmed down Unter den
Linden, East Berlin's main avenue, and spilled onto the broad plaza
at the base of the gate.
   Floodlights and fireworks lighted the sky as German unification
took effect at midnight to a stirring chorus of the national
anthem.
   Masses gathered from every vantage point to watch the center of
the celebration at the Reichstag, the old German Parliament
building near Brandenburg Gate.
   Germans draped themselves in the red, gold and black flag, threw
firecrackers and shimmied to the rock, swing, and jazz bands that
lined Unter den Linden.
   The gigantic party was heavily orchestrated - and commercially
sponsored - compared to the mass demonstrations that brought down
the Communist government last year and the jubilant euphoria that
followed the Nov. 9 opening of the Berlin Wall.
   ``This was overdone, all of this money,'' said East German
Hartmut Giese, 46, from a place where the Wall once stood in view
of the Brandenburg Gate celebration.
   ``But we need things like this to help bring us together, to
give us something to share,'' he said.
   On Unter den Linden, a West Berlin school teacher drew gawks as
she leaned on the railing overlooking the Spree River, smartly
dressed in black tights and a tailored Soviet major's jacket and
hat.
   ``I wanted to see what it felt like to be an occupying power in
East Germany,'' she said.
   Nearby, a huge crane suspended an East German-made Trabant, a
tiny, two-cylinder car that was one of the first products spurned
by East Germans when their borders opened to Western commerce.
   West German youths fired at it with flareguns, shredding the
now-obsolete East German flag that hanged below it.
   Leftist radicals held small rallies throughout the city to
protest unification. About 200 blew whistles outside a police
barrier at the Schauspielhaus, jeering arriving dignitaries.

   East German police drove away Western news teams
with cattle prods as they tried to film East German youths massing
to hear a Michael Jackson concert just across the Berlin Wall, the
journalists said today.
   About 4,000 East Germans gathered near the Brandenburg Gate on
Sunday night. They came to hear the American rock 'n' roll star
perform about 200 yards away for thousands of others at his concert
in West Berlin.
   West German television news teams were on the East Berlin side
of the wall and tried to film the crowd.
   But East German security police, waving electronic cattle prods,
drove them away from the scene, said the journalists.
   West Germany's diplomatic mission protested the incident to the
East German government.
   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was a
large contingent of communist plainclothes security men deployed
among the East German fans. They said a few arrests were made.
   On Friday, about 2,000 East Germans gathered near the
Brandenburg Gate to hear the British rock group Pink Floyd, which
performed in West Berlin on the first night of a three-night
``Berlin Rock Marathon.''
   East German security police arrested about 40 people during that
concert, witnesses said.

   The two Germanys ended 45 years of division with a
blaze of fireworks and the pealing of church bells Wednesday,
declaring the creation of a new German nation in the heart of
Europe.
   Near the ruins of Hitler's citadel in the city that symbolized
the Cold War division of Europe, the German flag was hoisted to
crown the dramatic rush to unify a Germany divided by World War II
and the Communist Berlin Wall.
   Rockets burst in the sky over Berlin, illuminating the
war-scarred Reichstag building and the Brandenburg Gate. The shower
of fireworks also lighted the upturned faces of thousands of
Germans, united in peace but troubled by the political and economic
problems facing a united Germany.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Richard von Weizsaecker and
former leader Willy Brandt stood in the glare of floodlights at the
Reichstag and joined in singing the national anthem as a vast party
occurred across the land of 78 million residents. Millions of
Germans and a watching world joined the ceremony by television.
   Wednesday was declared a national holiday, but late Tuesday
police in Goettingen, 66 miles south of Hanover, reported 1,000
leftist protesters opposed to unification rampaged through the
city. Authorities said the radicals broke store windows and chanted
``Never Again Germany!'' and ``Nazis out!''
   In Berlin, police detained seven people who were caught with
paint and gas pistols. Another man was arrested in the Kreuzberg
district after a policeman was stabbed in the arm during a scuffle
between police and about 500 youthful demonstrators.
   In the northern port of Rostock, authorities evacuated 23 Soviet
Jews from a refugee center because of fears the center could become
a target of rightist radicals. No incidents were reported.
   At least four people were injured and more than 10 arrested in
scuffles between police and demonstrators in Schwerin, where some
celebrated unification with the Nazi ``Sieg-Heil'' salute,
witnesses said. Police also reported clashes with youths in Leipzig
and Hamburg.
   The ceremony marked return of a united Germany built on the
ruins of Adolf Hitler's defeat in World War II and the end of Cold
War antagonism that split Europe into competing blocs led by the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   It came less than 11 months after the Berlin Wall was opened
Nov. 9, 1989, by a tide of democracy that swept away Communist
regimes across Eastern Europe.
   Fourteen schoolchildren from the former East and West Germanys
carried the huge, 72-square-yard German flag and hoisted it up the
132-foot-tall mast in front of the Reichstag.
   Hundreds of thousands of people, waving German flags, crowded
along the Unten den Linden thoroughfare and June 17th Street that
once were cut by the Berlin Wall.
   Fireworks exploded over the Reichstag as a replica of the
Liberty Bell, donated to Berlin by the American people, pealed.
   ``Germany is one again, Germany is sovereign,'' said German
television. ``Forty-five years after the unconditional surrender''
of Nazi Germany ``the two German states are united.''
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said of unification minutes
before midnight, ``What for most people had been only a dream has
become reality.''
   Then, Kurt Masur directed Beethoven's Ninth Sympony as East
Germany ceased to exist to the deep chords of the ``Ode to Joy.''
   City authorities had banned demonstrations near the Brandenburg
Gate, the 200-year-old monument that was a focus of celebrations.
   The broad thoroughfares around the Brandenburg Gate were
thronged with tens of thousands of people hours before the historic
occasion, and vendors sold food, drinks and souvenirs.
   Dixieland jazz, street musicians and organ-grinders played music
that rang in the chilly fall air.
   Searchlight beams waved in a cloudless sky, and a tall crane
dangled an old East German ``Trabi'' car 50 feet in the air just
south of the massive stone gate.
   About 200 leftist radicals lined a police barrier outside the
Schauspielhaus, blowing whistles and jeering at dignitaries
arriving for a formal state ceremony hosted by the departing East
German government.
   The radicals chanted ``Germany, drop dead!''
   Kohl, 60, said in a statement to the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper that the new Germany will help stabilize Europe, and that
it would not be a ``restless Reich'' like Nazi Germany, which
plunged Europe into its most disastrous war.
   The unification of Germany is a ``European, indeed a world event
of historic rank,'' Kohl said.
   Several German newspapers published the approved verse of the
national anthem to be sung in unified Germany - not the old
``Deutschland Ueber Alles'' verse - but the third verse, which
starts: ``Unity and Justice and Freedom for the German
fatherland.''
   The verse admonishes Germany to ``bloom,'' not to be ``above
all,'' the old mission that frightens some Europeans.
   Only a year ago the rush toward unity was barely starting. East
Germans demonstrated for political freedoms and the right to leave
their country. The Communist government opened the Berlin Wall last
fall but was swept away anyway in a peaceful popular revolution.
   East Germans began to demonstrate for unification, which was
taken up by Kohl and his government, and eventually approved by
Moscow and the Allies.
   The Soviets agreed to let united Germany remain in NATO and to
remove their troops by the end of 1994, although Germany is paying
Moscow $9.5 billion to finance the withdrawal. The Allies will keep
troops in West Berlin until the Soviets leave.
   The last formal steps to clear the way for unity were taken
mostly by the foreign powers who defeated Nazi Germany and retained
legal powers as occupiers in Berlin.
   In New York on Monday, President Bush and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze were present for the signing of a
declaration of a suspension of the Allies' special powers.
   On Tuesday morning, Allied generals from the United States,
Britain and France signed a letter ceding their powers. Buglers
played as the three flags were lowered for the last time at the
Allied headquarters.
   Maj. Gen. Raymond E. Haddock of the United States, Maj. Gen.
Robert J.S. Corbett of Britain and Maj. Gen. Francois Cann of
France then went to West Berlin City Hall to deliver the letter to
Mayor Walter Momper.
   ``We three commandants will shortly leave Berlin and we shall
carry with us a feeling of satisfaction that our collective efforts
have been successful. The Berlin which we leave will be whole and
free,'' their letter said.
   Kohl said in a statement broadcast on television that Germany
thanked the Western allies for their support, and he also praised
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying: ``He recognized the
nations' right to pursue their own path. Without this decision, we
would not have experienced the day of German unity so soon.''
   Much work needs to be done, Kohl said.
   ``Particularly at this moment, we Germans must show solidarity
toward one another,'' the chancellor said. ``A difficult path lies
before us.''
   The mighty West German economy, with a gross national product
last year of $1.4 trillion, has to rebuild East Germany, which had
one-fourth of West German's population but an economy only
one-eighth as big in 1989 and failing fast in its last days.
   East Germany's work force of 9 million had 360,000 out of work
in August, and 1.4 million were on so-called ``short work'' with an
uncertain future.

"We just showed up yesterday and said, 'Hi, we're here, we want to sing,' "

   ``Ach, the stinking fumes from those terrible
one-lung wrecks! Who would have thought pollution was the smell of
freedom?''
   With that, cabbie Augustin Vogel left the wheel of his
Mercedes-Benz taxi and helped a laughing, cheering crowd of West
Berliners push another backfiring ``Trabbi,'' the East German
two-cylinder car, through the newly opened hole in the Berlin Wall
at Potsdamer Platz.
   Two blue-bereted French soldiers amused the crowd and shocked
the children peering out the streaky windows of the stalled car by
chipping away at the Wall with hammers and chisels.
   The big weekend shopping spree that saw 3 million East Germans
live the fantasies that tantalized them for years on western TV had
slowed from a torrent to a steady gush, but every daylight hour was
still rush hour on the streets of West Berlin.
   You had to wait in line to get into Woolworth's on Tauentzien
Strasse, but on the opposite side of Checkpoint Charlie sales girls
looked out the windows of empty boutiques with names like ``Lotus''
and ``Panda'' along Leipziger Strasse, East Berlin's fashion avenue.
   Shoppers hurried through the chilling fog with baby carriages,
shopping carts and rucksacks crammed with free world goodies.
   Even a sale on the eastern side _ ``stark reduziert'' _ of
snuggie wool damen slips, ladies' almost knee-length panties from
China, at 4 marks and Russian-made Strumpf Hose, at 14 marks,
failed to stem the exodus to the big mall over the Wall.
   A surpising consensus of sidewalk opinion along the
Kurfuerstendamm, West Berlin's Fifth Avenue, blamed the fog on the
fume-spewing Trabants and the slightly larger Wartburgs.
   ``Still it's a miracle to see all those DDR plates,'' enthused
refrigeration repairman Otto Esser, who played hookey from work to
spend his third day watching the flow of traffic through the Wall.
   ``This has been the happiest time of my life. I was two years
old when the Wall went up. I'm taking pictures for my infant son,
who hopefully won't even have the Wall, as a memory.''
   ``Oranges, bananas and coffee, that's what the Easties mainly
buy with the 100 marks handed out free to them by the banks,''
reported Helga Rosmunsen, a beautician who also called in sick to
spend another day watching the ceaseless flow of humanity along a
dust-beaten thoroughfare that only a week ago had been a death
strip.
   ``Even on a crowded downtown street you can tell an East from a
West Berliner by the happiness in their eyes. No wonder. Have you
ever tried to get real coffee over there?''
   Absenteeism was only a minor problem as another work week began
in East Berlin, but the weekend of wonders glowed brighter than the
few Christmas tree lights looming faintly in the fog.
   The Volkskammer, the Communist-dominated parliament, was
electing a new prime minister in the old town hall up by the
Brandenburg Gate, but at a Bierstube just a few blocks away
blue-collar beer drinkers switched off the government television
news to see if the Western channels were reporting any new holes in
the Schandmauer, the wall of shame.
   Meanwhile, on the other side of the Brandenburg Gate, now
sheared of its barbed wire curls, a procession of famous Western TV
anchors from several dozen countries waited their turn to do
stand-ups in the floodlit splendor of this landmark rubbled arch.
   Even at the Museum at Checkpoint Charlie _ with its bizarre
collection of motorbikes, battered buses, homemade submarines and
hot-air balloons that had confounded East Berlin's wall guards,
patrol dogs and mine fields _ NBC's Tom Brokaw and crew had to line
up for an interview with the curators.
   At the CSSR Kultur und Informationszentrum just a few hundred
yards to the east, there was no wait for interviews and no culture
customers either, despite a display of children's patriotic poster
art.
   ``The Easties will be back in even larger numbers this
weekend,'' predicted postcard vendor Axel Gruber at the Potsdamer
hole in the wall.
   ``This time it won't be for just shopping. They'll want to see
our famous zoo and the Rembrandts and the Head of Queen Nefertiti
in the Dahlem Museum. They know free Berlin has more to offer than
blue jeans and cassettes of the British rock group Exodus.''

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said
today that the days of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu are
numbered and called for his replacement.
   ``It is a regime of personal, family power that has no honest
reason to remain,'' Mitterrand said at a news conference during his
three-day visit to East Germany. ``I think that the days of this
regime, in a Europe in full movement, are numbered. But at what
price!''
   In his first condemnation of the bloody suppression of protests
in Romania, Mitterrand ruled out foreign intervention to topple
Ceausescu. He said ``the response has to come from Romania.''
   Mitterrand also met with East German political leaders today to
express the concerns of the West about the possibility of German
unification.
   His visit came as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told West
German lawmakers that the Germanys plan to strengthen all economic
and political ties.
   But Kohl also tried to ease the concerns of European nations
worried about a united Germany, saying the growing closeness of the
two countries can only help the continent.
   Meanwhile, the West German government said East Germany would
open Berlin's Brandenburg Gate on Friday. The gate is a historic
portion of the Berlin Wall viewed by many as a symbol of German
unity.
   Kohl, East German Premier Hans Modrow, West Berlin Walter
Momper, and East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack will participate in the
historic ceremonies, said government spokesman Hans Klein.
   The official East German news agency ADN said Mitterrand met
with Modrow and that the ``joint responsibility for balance in
Europe'' was the main topic.
   Mitterrand and Modrow also discussed the possibility of
expanding ties, while the East German premier expressed interest in
a trade and cooperation agreement with the European Economic
Community, ADN said.
   It added that Mitterrand had reacted ``positively'' to the idea
of closer East German ties to the EEC.
   But before leaving Paris on Wednesday, Mitterrand said: ``For
the whole of Europe, it would not be good _ indeed it would be very
dangerous _ to reopen the issue of the existing borders.''
   In an interview with East German television, he also said the
``two paths open for the Germans are the democratic path and the
peaceful path.''
   The possibility of reunification was raised after the
pro-democracy movement recently forced the Communist Party in East
Germany to oust its hard-line leaders, lift travel restrictions and
open the Berlin Wall.
   Mitterrand arrived Wednesday, a few hours after Kohl Germany
ended an emotionally charged visit to East Germany that brought out
thousands advocating reunification.
   During Mitterrand's visit, French and East German officials are
to sign several agreements, including a five-year project for
closer economic and technical cooperation.
   At a state dinner Wednesday hosted by East Germany's interim
president Manfred Gerlach, a non-Communist, Mitterrand paid tribute
to the East German pro-democracy movement and said the Germans
should determine their own future.
   But he stressed that ``no country may impose its political
system on another.'' He said closer German ties would result in the
context of a strengthened European Community and a general
overcoming of the continent's division. Mitterrand is representing
the 12-nation EC, whose rotating presidency France holds until Dec.
31.
   He is also the first head of state from the three western World
War II Allies to visit East Berlin.
   The United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain have
ultimate authority over Berlin, a result of the postwar occupation
of Hitler's defeated Third Reich.
   While relations between Kohl and Mitterrand are close, the
French leader's statements before his trip highlighted traditional
French wariness of a strong Germany at the heart of Europe.

   Imelda Marcos' new attorney, trying to repair
the image of the former Philippine first lady, asks that people
compare her with Nancy Reagan.
   ``Suppose Mrs. Reagan were abducted from her home in California
and taken to the Philippines and charged in the Philippines with
crimes she allegedly committed in the U.S.,'' the attorney, Gerry
Spence said Friday. ``How do you think Mrs. Reagan would feel?''
   Spence made his remarks after a federal court hearing on the
racketeering indictment that charged Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband, Ferdinand Marcos, with embezzling more than $100 million
from the Philippine treasury to buy art and Manhattan real estate.
They also were charged with defrauding banks of $165 million in
loans. Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Spence of Jackson Hole, Wyo., who had represented the family of
Karen Silkwood, was hired by Mrs. Marcos as part of changes in her
defense team that included the dropping of two other attorneys.

   East Germany will tear down a 600-foot
section of the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate and allow
completely unhindered passage between the two sides of the city
there, West German television said.
   Since November, the East Germans have created numerous passage
points through the Berlin Wall but have retained nominal checks of
passports or identity cards.
   The section at the Brandenburg Gate will be the first section
without any official controls.
   ``The Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate will be torn down,''
the ZDF television network said Friday. ``East German border troops

   Keith Haring, whose cartoon-like drawings
appeared in public spaces from New York City's subways to the
Berlin Wall, has died of AIDS. He was 31.
   Haring, who had been diagnosed with the AIDS virus more than a
year ago, died early Friday in his downtown Manhattan apartment,
said an assistant, Margaret Slabbert.
   Active in AIDS fund-raising, Haring returned from a European
trip a month ago and fell ill soon after.
   Haring's work, characterized by human and animal figures in an
energized setting, was admired worldwide and brought him a

   A disease closely related to the AIDS virus
can almost certainly be traced back to an African monkey, which may
have given it to people by biting them, a researcher said.
   Dr. Vanessa M. Hirsch of Georgetown University said Friday the
West African epidemic of HIV-2 disease most likely comes from the
sooty mangabey, a nondescript charcoal-gray monkey that is now
endangered.
   The virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys. But
when humans contract the disease, it causes a serious illness that
is similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, although less
fatal.
   Hirsch said she believes HIV-2 was transmitted from monkeys to
people within the past century through a bite or some other close
contact.

   West Germans vandalized the Berlin Wall, an
official called for its removal, and an East German tried to escape
to the West on Sunday, the 28th anniversary of the day construction
began on the infamous barrier.
   Security forces also dispersed about 50 East Germans who tried
to demonstrate in East Berlin in front of the West German mission,
which was closed last week after a crowd of East Germans arrived
seeking refuge.
   Witnesses said the demonstrators tried to lay flowers at the
mission gates in an apparent act of solidarity with their
countrymen holed up inside demanding exit visas to the West. No
protesters were arrested.
   Dorothee Wilms, the West German minister for inter-German
affairs, criticized East Germany's effort ``to build up and perfect
the inhumane barriers'' between East and West. Her deputy chief,
Ottfried Hennig, predicted the wall would be taken down by the end
of the century.
   An unidentified assailant hurled a firebomb at the wall near the
Brandenburg Gate early Sunday, West German police said. The bomb
exploded when it crashed against the wall, but it burned out
without causing serious damage.
   The East German state news agency, ADN, said several masked
assailants from West Berlin damaged border barriers in the southern
sector of East Berlin.
   ADN, which did not describe the damage, said a diplomatic
protest would be lodged with West Berlin authorities.
   Witnesses at the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing between East
and West Berlin reported Sunday that at least one man attempted to
flee across the heavily guarded crossing just before noon. He was
arrested by East German border guards before reaching Western
territory, the witnesses said.
   In Budapest, Hungary, 200 people gathered at downtown
Voeroesmarty Square to protest the wall. The speakers, who included
young East German tourists, called for its demolition.
   Several displayed placards with slogans proclaiming, ``Make
Love, Not Wall,'' and ``We Have No Need of Any Control.'' No
violence was reported during the 40-minute demonstration.
   The August 13th Society, a human rights organization that
monitors East European refugee affairs, estimates that at least
40,000 East Germans have escaped across the borders with West
Germany since the wall was erected.
   Prior to 1961, hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled to the
West, draining the Communist state of many of its top scientists,
artists and intellectuals. The number of escapes surged over the
last few months after Hungary began dismantling its border barriers
with Austria.
   East Germans can usually obtain permission to travel to Hungary,
a neighboring Communist ally, and an estimated 1,500 of them have
illegally crossed from there into Austria this summer.
   Several hundred East Germans have recently sought refuge at West
German embassies, which has prompted Bonn to close its embassy in
Budapest and its mission in East Berlin.
   East Germany on Saturday defended the Berlin Wall and said hopes
for its removal are ``illusory.'' Neues Deutschland, the newspaper
of the East German Communist Party, said the wall is ``a step
toward peace'' and that it will remain in place to prevent East
Germans from fleeing to the West.

   Former President Reagan, once lambasted by
angry demonstrators in divided Berlin, was hailed Tuesday as a
returning hero.
   On Wednesday, Reagan is to cross into East Berlin at the
Brandenburg Gate, where he gave a speech in 1987 challenging Moscow
to tear down the Berlin Wall. That visit was marred by
demonstrations by 25,000 people opposed to U.S. foreign policy.
   Now that East and West Germany are to reunite in October, the
atmosphere is transformed. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old saw only
cheerful faces in his brief contact with the public.
   About 100 Germans and foreign tourists gathered outside the
Bristol Kempinski Hotel to see Reagan and his wife Nancy leave for
a diplomatic dinner. They applauded and called for autographs.
   The Berliner Morgenpost daily welcomed Reagan's visit with a
headline saying his walk through the Brandenburg Gate will mean
``Reagan's Dream Fulfilled.''
   Reagan and his wife arrived in Berlin early in the day to open a
10-day European trip.
   During his 1987 visit, Reagan voiced skepticism about reforms
started by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He said the one
thing Moscow could do to advance the cause of peace would be to
dismantle the Berlin Wall.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate,'' Reagan said. ``Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.''
   The former Communist rulers of East Germany opened the wall in
November in one of their last, desperate acts to stay in power.
   On Wednesday, Reagan will travel about a mile into East Berlin
to meet with officials there _ now democratically elected.

   Two hot-air balloons bearing peace slogans
were anchored Wednesday in front of the Brandenburg Gate as a sign

   Dozens of people looked on as a joint French-West German team

   The team had expected officials would turn down their request to
anchor the balloons on East Berlin territory, but the Foreign
Ministry granted permission, the official ADN news agency said.
   ``We have the luck to experience this new epoch of peace and
understanding,'' said Jean-Marc Culas, the head of the team. ``We
simply wanted to be there and bring our message with the balloons
to everyone.''
   It was yet another sign of relaxed rules along the once-dreaded
Berlin Wall, where dozens of souvenir-seekers continue hack away on
the western side gathering souvenirs.
   West Berlin police said they had taken into custody two
Americans and a West Berlin man who had broken out seven sections
of the wall, each measuring 8 feet high by more than 3 feet wide.
   The unidentified men apparently wanted to sell the sections as
souvenirs and had loaded five of them onto a truck before they were
caught, police said. Police said they were cited for theft and
released.

   East German workers early Saturday punched through
the Berlin Wall, lifting a section of concrete panel to create a
6-foot gap, the first hole in the fortification that has divided
East and West for nearly 30 years.
   On Friday, East Germany ended all border restrictions, and more
than 100,000 jubilant East Germans climbed over and rushed through
borders for the first time since 1961. They chatted amiably with
stony-faced guards who no longer have orders to open fire.
   Thousands crossed back and forth during the day. West German
television showed East German guards helping East Berliners climb
over the wall to avoid congested check points. Some border guards
were handed roses by beaming girls.
   Communist leader Egon Krenz told 150,000 people at a rally in
East Berlin that his new reforms ``will not be turned back.'' The
party's Central Committee approved a document calling for free
elections, more restrictions on its security forces and greater
separation of party and state.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany flew to West Berlin
hoping to speak with Krenz, who has stunned the world with rapid
reforms _ and a pledge of free elections _ intended to appease
pro-democracy protesters and end emigration to the West.
   Work began late Friday at the Bernauer Strasse.
   East Germans used a hydraulic crane to dismantle the round top
of the concrete wall. East German workers could be heard knocking
on the wall.
   Peter Zeisler, a West German police official at the scene, said:
``It will be a pretty hole that will make it possible for people
and cars to come through.''
   When the barrier was finally broken through early Saturday, East
German border guards and West German police shook hands. Then other
East German guards immediately placed a flimsy red-and-white metal
barrier in front of the opening.
   On the Western side of the wall, dozens of firemen dismantled
observation platforms from which West Berliners used to gaze
across. About 400 people watched, occasionally setting off
fireworks.
   ``We are speechless,'' said Helmut Keuchel, 48. ``This is a
fabulous and overwhelming experience.''
   Several thousand people celebrated at the Brandenburg Gate, the
great monument that, like the wall, was a symbol of Berlin's
division. Many danced on the wall, drank champagne, waved
sparklers, set off fireworks and chanted: ``The wall must go! The
wall must go!''
   East German border guards watched impassively as some in the
crowd used picks and hammers to chip away pieces of the hated
barrier for souvenirs.
   Thousands of East Berliners poured across the Glienicker Bridge,
on which some of the most famous spy trades took place, when it was
opened in the early evening.
   In West Berlin, thousands more streamed along the elegant
Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard, some carrying candles, others
toasting each other. Crowds of young girls could be seen rushing
down the street toward stores. Bars offered free drinks to East
Berliners.
   Police in West Berlin said they gave up counting Friday when
they reached 50,000 visitors.
   Krenz told those at the rally that ``the best of our people must
be elected to Parliament.'' He said reforms would make ``a new
revolution on German soil'' that would produce a communist system
``economically effective, politically democratic, and morally
pure.''
   ``These are not empty promises,'' he declared, addressing the
skepticism of those who have questioned his sincerity.
   Communist officials said Thursday that, for the first time since
the Berlin Wall was built, citizens could travel freely to the West
until a new travel law was drafted. On Friday, they made the open
border permanent.
   ``It is permanent and will be the foundation of a new travel
law,'' Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel said on state television.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told
20,000 cheering people outside the West Berlin city hall the East
Germans were cutting more holes in the wall and were expanding the
Glienicker Bridge crossing. Bells, some called them freedom bells,
rang in the background.
   Chancellor Kohl said: ``The spirit of freedom now reigns all
over Europe: Poland, Hungary, and now, East Germany. We claim this
right for all people in Europe. ... we claim it for all Germans ''
   President Bush said he would ``seize every chance'' to promote
democracy in Eastern Europe and his meeting next month in Malta
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will have
``even more importance.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the lifting of East
German travel restrictions ``the most dramatic event in East-West
relations'' since World War II, but added: ``There's a long way to
go before there is true freedom and true political pluralism in
East Germany.''
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
opening East Germany's borders would help stem emigration and end
``stereotypes about the Iron Curtain.''
   East Germans arrived in cars or taxis, on motorcycles, by foot
for their first taste of the West. Most apparently planned to
return home.
   East German roads were clogged with cars heading for the border,
but West German border officials said only about one-tenth of the
visitors planned to stay. So far this year, more than 200,000 East
Germans have gone to West Germany.
   People thronged East German police stations, waiting for the
travel passes officials said nearly everyone would be given.
Thousands went through simply by getting a stamp at a border
control point, and many crossed without special documents.
   ``We've just decided to leave our jobs for a little while, have
a look around and then go back over,'' said a young man who visited
Herleshausen with four compatriots. ``We don't know what our boss
will say about that. Perhaps he's over here too.''
   A young man drove to Herleshausen with his child for 15 minutes
just to buy a West German newspaper.
   ``I'm going over to pick up some brake pads you can only get in
the West,'' said a motorcyclist who crossed crossed at Helmstedt.
   In Berlin, many East Germans just wanted to shop or see the
sights. A group of East German workers took turns.
   ``Everybody wanted to go so we decided to do it in shifts,'' one
said. ``We're still fulfilling our quota of work.''
   Usually dour East German border guards chatted with countrymen
filing through border control points.
   ``You don't have to work today?'' one asked a young man at the
Invalidenstrasse crossing in Berlin.
   ``No, I've got the day off,'' was the reply.
   The ruling Politburo fired four more officials and began an
investigation of ``gross mistakes'' made by the leadership under
Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old party boss dismissed Oct. 18.
Honecker supervised the building of the wall 10 years before
becoming party chief.

<HEAD>US Embassy Denies Party Newspaper Report on Mexican Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy in East Berlin has posted a
denial on its outside wall of a report in the Communist Party
newspaper that the U.S.-Mexican border resembles a battle zone.
   It also said people try to get into the United States, not out
of it, as in the case of East Germany.
   Embassy officials posted the printed denial Monday in a
glassed-covered case attached to the wall of the embassy about 300
yards from the Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin, where East Germans
can walk up and read it.
   The statement disputes a report in the party newspaper Neues
Deutschland that calls the U.S.-Mexican border a ``fighting zone.''
   Neues Deutschland said there is often shooting in the area, with
an ``average of 3,000 arrests per day,'' and U.S. border troops
guarding it were trained to ``shoot instinctively.''
   In its denial, the embassy says the border is a ``showplace and
symbol of a complex social and economic situation'' and ``every
U.S. citizen is free to leave the United States when they want to.''
   Apparently in reference to restricted zones along the Berlin
Wall and the heavily fortified East German border with West
Germany, the embassy statement says the border between the United
States and Mexico has no fortifications.
   ``It has never had mine fields, automatic shooting devices,
shoot-to-kill orders, moats or barriers of steel and cement, to
hinder vehicles from crossing,'' the statement says, and in
contrast to the situation in East Germany, ``people attempt to
enter our country.''
   In addition to the Berlin Wall and armed guards, East Germany
has steel-mesh fences and walls along its nearly 870-mile border
with West Germany to prevent escapes to the West.
   The East Germans for years also had mine fields and automatic
shooting devices along the border, but began dismantling them
several years ago.
   According to West German figures, 188 East Germans have died
trying to escape across the the border since the Berlin Wall was
built in August 1961.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany recommended Wednesday that East Germany become stronger
economically before considering reunion with its rich and powerful
neighbor.
   At the end of an emotional visit to the East, he also discounted
fears of a ``Fourth Reich,'' an increasingly used term that raises
the specter of Adolf Hitler.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, who arrived in East
Berlin for a three-day official visit hours after Kohl returned to
the West, cautioned against changing borders in Europe.
   ``For the whole of Europe, it would not be good _ indeed it
would be very dangerous _ to reopen the issue of the existing
borders,'' he said.
   Before returning to Bonn, Kohl said ``the economic potential of
the German Democratic Republic must be strengthened'' before
reunification became a possibility. He said he expected a treaty
expanding relations to be completed before East Germany's first
free elections, scheduled for May 6.
   Mitterrand, in an interview with East German TV before leaving
Paris, said relations between the two German states have ``very
special characteristics.''
   He was the first head of state or government of the three
western World War II Allies to visit East Berlin. Aides said his
trip should not be viewed as recognition of East Berlin as the East
German capital, which the Western Allies reject.
   The United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain still have
authority over Berlin as a result of postwar occupation of Hitler's
Third Reich.
   Kohl, who spent two days in East Germany, said at a final news
conference his government would address the concerns of other
European countries as the two Germanys move closer together.
   ``It's the most natural thing that Germans want to live
together, but we all know it cannot come immediately,'' he said.
   East Germany's parliament scheduled a session for Jan. 11-12 to
debate a new travel law and legislation to promote joint ventures
with Western companies.
   A draft law providing alternatives to military service for
conscientious objectors also will be on the agenda, the official
news agency ADN reported.
   Bild, a West German newspaper, said another passage through the
Berlin Wall would be opened Friday at the historic Brandenburg
Gate, a symbol of German unity.
   Kohl and Premier Hans Modrow agreed at their summit Tuesday that
East Germany woulds open a pedestrian crossing at the gate before
Christmas and would lift travel restrictions for West Germans on
Christmas Eve.
   They also signed several agreements and pledged to negotiate a
treaty bringing them closer together, especially by expanding
economic links.
   In a commentary Wednesday, ADN said the summit was a success,
but ``anyone who hoped'' Kohl would arrive ``with a sack full of
Rhine gold rejoiced too early.''
   Kohl told reporters inter-German issues that could be discussed
soon included improving traffic connections and solving joint
telecommunications and pollution problems.
   ``We will have to work intensively'' on a common German
currency, he said, and acknowledged that as ``one of the most
difficult questions.''
   Kohl said the aim of a common currency was to allow West Germans
to buy goods in East Germany. East Germany restricts such purchases
because state subsidies make many goods much cheaper than in West
Germany, and shortages are feared.
   In a sign of the rapidly increasing economic links, East Germany
announced Wednesday the first joint venture with a West German firm
had been signed. A compact disc manufacturing plant is to be built
by the Pilz company, based outside Munich, and the East German
state conglomerate Robotron.
   In Bonn, a working group of both nations on promoting tourism
held its first meeting.
   Kohl said West Germany will support reform in East Germany and
``not only talk, but act.'' He pledged, however, to avoid
``destabilization,'' an apparent reference to the power vacuum
created by the collapse of Communist Party control over the past
two months.
   Addressing the concerns of neighboring countries, Kohl said:
``Fears based in the past are understandable, but there is nothing
to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talk about a Fourth
Reich.''

The Rams can't get to the Super Bowl but they can get to East Berlin by 
climbing through a hole in the Berlin Wall. Five of them did it Sunday, proving 
once again that anything in this world is possible as long as Joe Montana 
doesn't play for the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, by the time the Rams got there, it was more Berlin mall than Berlin 
Wall. "I wish we would've gotten over here earlier," said offensive tackle Irv 
Pankey as he surveyed the swap meet that has set up shop outside Brandenburg 
Gate. Much has happened during the nine months after the liberation of Berlin 
-- most of it good if you own a piece of the rock and are looking to turn a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
Want a chunk of the wall? Five deutschemarks (about $3) will get you a plastic 
bag of graffiti-splattered stones, complete with certificate of authenticity. A 
palm-sized slab goes for two deutschemarks. And for three, you can rent a 
hammer and a chisel and take matters into your own hands. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviet guards who once patrolled the wall are now retired, their 
uniforms are up for sale. Spread atop folding tables as far as the eye can see 
are helmets, officers' caps, khaki shirts, medals, pins, coats and trousers -- 
an altogether different type of radical chic. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you're more interested in something suitable for framing, a vendor will 
gladly show you something black and white and once read all over the zonal 
border -- signs that scream, with a foreboding air: 
</P>
<P>
 Sperrgebeit! 
</P>
<P>
 HALT! 
</P>
<P>
 The irony behind this curtain is palpable. After 30 years, the Western world's 
darkest symbol of Communist repression has been trampled underfoot by 
capitalistic fervor, where, if you wish to share a piece of history, it's going 
to cost you. 
</P>
<P>
The death trap has become a tourist trap. Maybe you call it progress. 
</P>
<P>
Several Rams went along for the ride within hours of the team plane's landing 
at Tegel Airport. The Rams are here for an exhibition game with the Kansas City 
Chiefs, but more than that, they are seeking their place in the sun. London in 
1988. Tokyo in 1989. Berlin in 1990. Searching for some kind of identity, and 
knowing that America's Team has already been taken, Georgia Frontiere has the 
Rams committed to going global. 
</P>
<P>
As the Lewis and Clark of the NFL's world-conquest program -- Lawrence Taylor 
uber alles -- the Rams know the value of a photo opportunity. So Sunday 
afternoon, five players were rustled together and quickly shuttled off to the 
wall, with a couple of brief stops in front of the cameras along the way. 
</P>
<P>
First up, Kaiser Wilhelm Church, a landmark in the middle of the financial 
district in West Berlin. This church, shelled during World War II, stands today 
as it did 45 years ago in memory of the bloodshed. The players posed in front 
of it and next to Berlin, a twisting metallic abstract sculpture that is 
supposed to symbolize the relationship between East and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Art critic Pankey's analysis? 
</P>
<P>
"Some silver stuff in the middle of the street." 
</P>
<P>
Next, the bus weaved its way to Brandenburg Gate and a glimpse at the last few 
remnants of the wall. You can buy more than you can see and the hawkers hit 
everyone in the Rams' party, some more than others. 
</P>
<P>
Pankey decided he had to have a Russian hat, fur-lined and fur-covered, ideal 
for days such as Sunday -- pushing 90 degrees and panting amid the humidity. 
</P>
<P>
"Amigo!" Pankey shouted at an astonished salesman. "How much for one of those?" 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five marks, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Pankey pulled off the white baseball cap he was wearing, complete with sharp 
NFL logo. "I'll trade you this for that," Pankey proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor shook his head. "Is worth one mark," he replied, frowning at 
Pankey's headgear. 
</P>
<P>
So Pankey shelled out the 35 marks and grinned beneath the black fur for the 
photographers until he walked a few yards and saw the same hats selling at 
another booth for 15 marks. 
</P>
<P>
Silly American. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached the wall, Pankey was determined to get his money's 
worth. He rented one of the hammer-and-chisel kits and went off to stalk the 
cement. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to get a good spot," he said. "I'm going to be upset if I don't get a good 
piece of this wall." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey got more than one. He wanted his twin infant sons, Keith and Kevin, to 
have something besides pine cones and lizards by the time they reach 
show-and-tell age. Then he passed the hammer to his teammates. Fullback Robert 
Delpino took a few whacks. Kicker Mike Lansford and guard Duval Love pounded 
away as well. 
</P>
<P>
The graffiti is striking and it is telling. There are many references to Pink 
Floyd, the rock group whose concept album, "The Wall," was the inspiration for 
last month's German Woodstock, which brought a crowd of 300,000 to the real 
wall for a live performance of the music. There are lyrics from the Sex 
Pistols' "Holiday In the Sun": "Now there's a reason to be waiting at the 
Berlin Wall." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was built, Berliners had been waiting for this wall to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are holes in the cement big enough to drive a lineman through. 
Pankey completed the journey, stepping from west to east, and someone asked him 
if the wall takes on a new meaning when viewed from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall's down," Pankey answered. "That's the best meaning." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the Rams were summoned back to the bus and headed back to 
the team hotel, where beds and treatment for severe jet-lag awaited. Pankey 
looked beat, and he'd been taken at least once, but he figured there are worse 
PR gigs than this. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a kick in the butt," Pankey said with a grin. "I think I scared the 
hell out of some of the people there. A lot of people just turned around and 
looked at me and kept looking up. They had to catch themselves. It was a new 
experience, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-5, 280-pound professional football player in Germany. A newly 
dismantled Berlin Wall. The sightings are for real, even if they do take some 
time to sink in.

   East Berliners reacted with astonishment to the
announcement Thursday that their Communist government was allowing
them to travel freely to the West for the first time in decades.
   ``Is it really true?'' asked Mario Schmidt.
   ``Show me the ADN report,'' the 18-year-old demanded, seizing a
copy of the news as reported by East Germany's official news agency.
   ``Why don't they just tear the wall down right away?'' said
student Birgit Grosspetzsch, 18, referring to the Berlin Wall built
in 1961 by East Germany to keep its citizens from going West.
   Late Thursday, about 100 East Germans gathered at the
Brandenburg Gate, the huge monument just over the Berlin Wall in
East Berlin.
   ``Open the gate! Open the gate!'' they chanted.
   Two sisters whose last trip West was to the funeral of their
grandmother in West Berlin in 1966 were so happy that tears of joy
brimmed in their eyes.
   ``We're going to the friends in West Berlin as soon as we can,''
said the older sister, aged 56. ``Really great,'' added her
44-year-old sister.
   West German police said about 100 East Germans had already
crossed through Berlin Wall crossing points, while other East
Germans apparently waited for police offices that issue visas to
open in the morning. The government announcement came after the
offices closed.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo, announced
that East Germany's heavily fortified frontier with West Germany
would be opened as a provisional step until a law is passed to
allow greater freedom of travel.
   The decision means all East Germans ``can travel over all East
German border checkpoints,'' including through the Berlin Wall,
Schabowski told reporters in East Berlin.
   Schabowski did not say when the law would be passed.
   Several young people thought the news would help to stem the
mass exodus to the West. More than 200,000 have fled for the West
so far this year, including 50,000 who have escaped through
Czechoslovakia since Saturday.
   ``I think that even some of those who left recently will come
back now,'' said a 25-year-old electrician who gave his name only
as Thomas.
   He had just heard the news from his mother, who made immediate
plans to visit his brother, one of the tens of thousands of people
who have fled West in recent weeks through Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   ``I'll be off to visit my brother in Munich,'' he beamed. ``But
I'll come back. I think many people will think about that now,
where so much is changing here.''
   Another mother, Brigitte Hinze, made immediate plans to take
underwear to her 19-year-old son, who fled to West Berlin through
Prague last week. She was carrying the garments in a plastic bag,
ready to mail off, when she heard the news.
   ``Now I'm going to visit as soon as I can,'' she said, her voice
shaking. ``I'm so happy.''
   Uwe Landgraf, 28, made plans for a trip to Paris. ``Now I no
longer feel locked in here.''
   Sabine, a 22-year-old secretary, also named France as her first
destination.
   ``Now I can get to know countries that we only ever saw on maps
or heard about at school,'' she said.
   Several of those hearing the news at East Berlin's Schoenhauser
Allee metro station said they believed West Germans also would be
happy.
   ``They can't cope any more,'' Thomas said.
   West German officials have said their reception centers are
overflowing with the East Germans who have come West just since
their Communist government allowed them out through Czechoslovakia
last Friday.
   Although relaxing travel restrictions would satisfy one of the
central demands of dissatisfied East Germans, others remain.
Demonstrators have demanded free elections and the end of the
Communists 40-year monopoly on power.
   ``One party, that's a dictatorship, and nothing will change,''
said an 80-year-old widow. ``We need a multiparty government.''
   ``We've got to get the right people in there _ then we can start
talking,'' said Wolfgang Karek, 50, a newspaper vendor and
part-time musician.
   Communist leader Egon Krenz on Thursday urged a new law ensuring
free and democratic elections. But he did not say whether he was
urging a true multiparty system.
   Despite the jubilation over the prospect of free travel, East
Berliners remain skeptical of promised reforms, having heard too
many promises from the Communists before to believe in fundamental
change now.
   ``The changes are not yet really what we want,'' said a canteen
worker in his 50s. ``We need completely new people _ we've seen
where it led with the old lot.''
   ``You can forget him,'' a 70-year-old retired trade worker said
of Krenz. ``Just a puppet like all the rest of them. For the
moment, he's the only man possible, but he won't last.''
