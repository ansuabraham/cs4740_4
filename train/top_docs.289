Three Sachems: Clay, Webster, Calhoun
---
By David Shribman</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Three decades ago, John Kennedy, obsessed with greatness in Congress but unwilling to achieve it himself, headed a committee to select which senators to honor with portraits in the ornate Senate Reception Room. 
Scholars and commentators were consulted and the verdict was fairly predictable. 
The top three finishers were Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun. 

   Clay, Webster and Calhoun -- their names flow off the tongue in a group. 

   The leading political figures of the "second generation" of American leaders, they were, as University of Virginia historian Merrill Peterson puts it, "part of the furniture of American memory." 

   "The Great Triumvirate" (Oxford, 576 pages, $27.95) is an unusual alchemy -- one part history, one part biography -- by a leading American historian who argues that these three men -- one from the East, one from the South, one from the West -- were the match of the founding generation of Americans: "When the last of this 'second race of giants' passed away in 1852, nothing was left to challenge the sway of the Lilliputians," he writes. 
"The republic lost its glory -- the regalia of great statesmen." 

   Henry Clay, the man John Quincy Adams called "a republican of the first fire," elevated the House to new importance. 
He fashioned his own ideology, an "American System" that consisted of policies to encourage national economic development, chiefly protective tariffs and a series of internal improvements that now would be known as public-works projects. 
And though he thought slavery would wither away -- he later advocated repatriating slaves back to Africa as colonists -- he became known for his ability to sculpt compromise after compromise on the slavery question. 
Clay, according to Mr. Peterson, had a "genius for accommodation, sensitivity to opposing political forces and ingenuity in adapting old policies to new conditions." 

   Webster is known in history much the same way he was known as a young Boston lawyer with a gift for oratory -- the "guardian of the Constitution." 
Mr. Peterson credits him with pioneering the "theory of the Constitution as the fundamental law of one people, rather than a compact of sovereign states." 

   And John C. Calhoun. 
First pressed by the early Nullifiers, then their champion, he embraced this tool of expedience to assure his base in South Carolina, to protect his region from the threat of high tariffs and to muffle the drumbeats of Abolition. 
"It took possession of him, transfixed his political vision, and justified all his actions," says Mr. Peterson. 

   He once viewed slavery as scaffolding for the South, support that would be removed "when the building is finished." 
Later he came to call it "a great good." 
He was, moreover, a proponent of small government in the Jefferson model, aiming for nothing less, as he put it, "than to turn back the Government to where it commences operations in 1789." 
Mr. Peterson sees Calhoun's power resting "not on charisma or organization but on a political ideology that postulated unity in the state and eventually in the section as the only means of securing slavery and the South from an encroaching northern majority." 

   The three united in 1832 to oppose Andrew Jackson but, Mr. Peterson points out, spent most of their public lives dancing a political version of the country reel, changing partners and calculating their every move with an eye on what the others would do. 
Webster first opposed Clay on tariff protection, then switched sides and found himself opposing Calhoun. 
Calhoun, as vice president under John Quincy Adams, stacked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee against Secretary of State Clay. 
And although Clay and Webster, the two leading Whigs, united in opposing an independent Treasury scheme proffered by the Van Buren administration, they fought so much they paved the way for William Henry Harrison to snatch the presidency in 1840. 

   Each had great achievements. 
From his position in the border state of Kentucky, Clay formed two great compromises. 
Although he never shed the charges of "bargain and corruption" growing out of his maneuvers that left John Quincy Adams as president in 1824, he was an active and successful secretary of state. 
Webster is now regarded as among the greatest secretaries of state in history, having prevented war with the British and helped fix the nation's northern border. 
And Calhoun today is regarded as one of the few original thinkers of the era that followed the Founding Fathers'. 

   Despite the triumvirs' documented greatness, Mr. Peterson offers harsh assessments of their legacies. 
The Civil War that followed their deaths would have offered Clay "grim proofs of the limits of compromise." 
It would have demonstrated to Webster "the fragility of law and constitutions before moral and social forces he never truly understood." 
And it offered an "awful judgment" on Calhoun. 
His face ended up on the currency and postage stamps not of the U.S., but of the Confederacy.

<TEXT>
   Americans wanting to sell anything from
biscuits and cigars to plumbing and whiskey often have tried to
cloak their wares in the presumed respectability of Congress and
its most illustrious members.
   Daniel Webster, for example.
   Webster, perhaps the most famous senator and orator of the
mid-19th century, had his face and his name used to promote cigars,
flour, and a concoction known as Dr. J.C. Ayres Cherry Pectoral,
promoted as a cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis, croup, whooping
cough and other ailments.
   According to a new three-case exhibit recently installed in a
Senate corridor, the claim that Webster endorsed Dr. Ayres' elixer
may have been somewhat exaggerated.
   Promoters of the product claimed that Webster praised it in 1853.
   The famed statesman died in 1852.
   The exhibit, organized by the U.S. Senate Commission on Art and
Antiquities, includes a shiny metal spatula from 1910 which
demonstrates that even 58 years after Webster's death his name
still had commercial appeal.
   Webster's features are engraved on the widest spot of the
antique pancake turner, which is also emblazoned with the words:
``Daniel Webster Flour, Better Than the Best'' and ``One Good Turn
Deserves Another.''
   Webster's face was also used on the flour bag with the words:
``Daniel Webster Flour Bakes Everything Better.''
   In an age when a cigar brought to mind a politician, Webster
also was used to promote a brand of cigars.
   Their name?
   ``Websters,'' of course.
   The names and faces of Webster's contemporaries, Sens. John C.
Calhoun of South Carolina and Henry Clay of Kentucky also were used
to peddle cigars.
   And for years, Old Crow whiskey identified itself as, ``The
Whiskey That Henry Clay Took to Washington.''
   ``From the earliest days of advertising, senators have been
known to endorse commercial products,'' notes a news release issued
by the Senate commission.
   From the beginning of the advertising age in the mid-19th
century, ``our country's enterprises have understood the power of
national legislative symbols to influence the American consumer,''
the commission said.
   The display has a title _ ``What This Country Needs'' _ taken
from the 1917 declaration of Vice President Thomas Marshall that
``What this country needs is a good five cent cigar.''
   Although Marshall did not recommend any particular brand of
nickel cigar, the exhibit makes clear that he would not have been
breaking new ground had he done so.
   A much later advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes reads:
``U.S. Sen. Gerald P. Nye Says: `I enjoy the comfort a light smoke
gives my throat.''
   The familiar image of the Capitol dome has been used, according
to the exhibit, to symbolize ``purity, wholesomeness,
respectability and success, innovation and leadership, prosperity
and celebration.''
   In one 1890's advertisement, the Capitol looms in the background
as two bearded senators are served Schlitz beer at a table
surrounded by ferns.
   ``The Capitol at Washington is painted with oxide of zinc,''
proclaims another advertisement, implying that American homeowners
would do well to use that ingredient on their own domicile.
   On display are advertisements for breakfast cereals, stationery,
soft drinks, biscuits, tires, soap, cameras, and plumbing, all
using the Capitol theme.
   One proclaims that the Durham Plumbing System has been installed
in ``the greatest building on this continent _ the Capitol at
Washington.''
   In another, fashionably dressed men, presumably senators, are
shown striding up the Senate's marble steps.
   All of this has caused an occasional raised eyebrows, and the
Arts and Antiquities Commission notes that the use of the Capitol
in commercial advertising never has been sanctioned by Congress.
   But neither has the practice been banned.
   In 1956 the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a bill
banning the use of ``pictures of the Capitol or other public
buildings in ... advertising when it would be reasonably calculated
to convey the false impression that the company has some connection
with, or was insured by, the United States Government.''
   The measure passed the Senate.
   But the House failed to act on it.

   The Senate, told it ``is a guardian of
tradition without becoming a barrier to change,'' celebrated its
first two centuries of history on Thursday, recalling its faltering
beginnings and noting its many milestones.
   April 6, 1789, was the date that the first Senate, meeting in
New York City, finally reached a quorum _ and thus was able to
start conducting business _ after a frustrating month of failing to
do so.
   ``History oozes from these walls,'' said Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, as the day of commemoration began in the Old Senate Chamber
in the Capitol with the issuing of a postage stamp displaying the
gilt shield and eagle still suspended over the presiding officer's
chair.
   The eagle and shield were there during speeches on the old
chamber's floor which served the Senate from 1810 to 1859, and can
be seen in 19th century prints involving three famous senators of
the era: Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, Henry Clay of Kentucky
and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.
   Those three senators and the roles they played in the period
before the Civil War were invoked repeatedly as past and former
senators hailed the Senate as an institution.
   Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, a former Senate Republican
leader, said the sense of history in the old Senate hall, and in
the Senate's present chamber first occupied in 1859, is so strong
that at times one can truly ``smell the marble.''
   Nearly 20 former senators _ including Baker and former
Democratic leader Mike Mansfield of Montana _ joined senators in
the current 101st Congress for the ceremonies. Members of the House
of Representatives celebrated the quorum bicentennial session of
that body on Tuesday.
   Former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton, a Democrat from Missouri, said
that the legacy of the early Senate is the art of the American
political compromise.
   ``Today compromise is woven into constitutional fabric of the
nation,'' Eagleton said.
   Although many senators past and present have regarded compromise
as morally wrong, Eagleton said it is politically essential.
   ``Compromise, in my judgment, is getting a bad rap,'' Eagleton
said. ``Without it we screech to a halt, paralyzed by
intransigence.''
   The Senate session began at 11 a.m., the hour of the first
session two centuries ago.
   With the conclusion of the ceremony's first half in the old
chamber, senators formed a procession to the Senate's present
meeting place down the hall.
   Senior senators from the states answered the roll call,
beginning with Delaware, which became the first state in 1787, and
continuing to Hawaii, which in 1959 became the 50th to join the
union.
   When South Carolina's name was called, Republican Strom Thurmond
gave this response: ``South Carolina was not the first state to be
admitted, but it was the first to secede'' in 1860. After the Civil
War, South Carolina returned to the union in 1868.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, noted Thomas Jefferson's description
of the Senate as a stage, and recalled some of the drama the
present chamber has witnessed, including the one-vote defeat of the
attempt to oust President Andrew Johnson during Reconstruction
after the Civil War, and the rejection of President Woodrow
Wilson's effort to bring the United States into the League of
Nations after World War I.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that while
the Senate has undergone many changes over the years, it remains a
place where the rights of the minority are protected and speech can
remain virtually unlimited.
   ``It is a guardian of tradition without becoming a barrier to
change,'' he said.
   Senators moved in and out of the ceremonies to spirited John
Philip Sousa marches played by the Marine Corps band.
   A tourist asked a doorman: ``Does a band play every day the
Senate meets?''
   ``No,'' the doorman replied. ``Only once every 200 years.''

Assessing Early American Tariffs</HL>
<DD> 08/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   It was amusing to read James Bovard's "American History: Pass a Tariff, Start a War" (editorial page, July 20) in defense of free trade, because the truth about American history is that for the greater part of it, the U.S. was a strongly protectionist nation. 
From 1789 until the end of World War II, our country rose to become the greatest economic power on earth behind high tariff walls. 
The Japanese and Koreans seem to have learned more from American history than we have. 

   Mr. Bovard cites anachronisms such as John Taylor and nonentities such as Frank H. Hurd. 
But those of us who believe a little trade regulation might be a very good thing indeed can take comfort in such historical allies as Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun before he became the sectional spokesman for the free-trading but slave-holding plantation owners of the south. 

   What is more, since George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt all supported tariffs or other protectionist measures during their presidencies, we might even want to conclude that the world's greatest monument to fair trade was carved in the rock of Mount Rushmore.

   Mr. Bovard makes the bold claim that "Few people realize that restrictive trade policies were a major cause of the American Revolution." 
He cites Britain's prohibiting Americans from "erecting any mill for rolling or slitting iron." 

   Americans during that time did not seem disturbed by this prohibition. 
John Adams wrote that, "America has all along consented, still consent and ever will consent, that Parliament . . . should regulate the trade of the dominions." 
And the First Continental Congress, in a resolution, declared that "we cheerfully consent to the operation of such Acts of the British Parliament, as are bona fide restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members." 

   Pre-Revolutionary Americans perhaps can be excused for thinking that trade restrictions benefit the nation. 
After all, Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations" had not yet been published. 
Modern Americans cannot likewise be excused.

   From the days President George Washington
dispatched the first United States Marshals to quell the Whiskey
Rebellion, the storied lawmen have been part of the country's most
colorful and most violent episodes.
   They did the hanging for famous ``Hanging Judge'' Isaac Parker of
Fort Smith, Ark., after rounding up bank and train robbers hiding in
the brush of Indian Territory, smashed whiskey stills during
Prohibition and protected slaves freed after the Civil War.
   The nation's oldest law enforcement organization, the Marshals
began their bicentennial celebration Thursday with the opening of an
exhibit at the Supreme Court followed by a black-tie dinner at a
nearby hotel.
   Organized by the Marshals Service with the help of the
Smithsonian Insitution, the exhibit displays artifacts from
massacres and shootouts that have earned the men their place in the
lore of the Wild West and their immortalization by movie legends
John Wayne and Henry Fonda.
   ``As the United States expanded across the continent, U.S.
Marshals and their deputies established the federal goverment's
authority over areas that had known little order and no goverment.
Most of them were rough, uncouth men,'' according to an excerpt of
the Marshals' official history by Frederick S. Calhoun.
   The brothers of Deputy Frank Dalton, one of many men killed in
Indian Territory, were also deputies before they turned to robbing
banks.
   ``They were the federal goverment at the local level,'' Calhoun
said. ``There was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy, so when the
citizens got mad they took it out on the federal marshals.''
   As a result, as many as 100 marshals and their deputies died in
Indian Territory between 1872 and 1896, their deadliest era, Calhoun
said.
   ``With the exception of Indian Territory, the far most dangerous
time to be a marshal was in the South after the Civil War,'' Calhoun
said. ``If the Ku Klux Klan didn't get you, the moonshiners did.''
   At least 400 and as many as 700 marshals have died in the line of
duty, more than any other law enforcement agency. But the exact
number isn't known because of difficulties in determining whether
members of posses had actually been deputized before their deaths,
said Marshals Service director Stanley Morris.
   ``At almost every point in history when the federal government
was involved in a significant event, there were marshals
participating,'' said Marshals Service spokesman Stephen Boyle.
   A marshal who fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a
homestead in the Oklahoma land run of 1889 at Guthrie; marshals
guarded the first black student at the University of
Mississippi-Oxford in the 1960s; and marshals ringed the Pentagon
during the Vietnam war protests of the early 1970s.
   They arrested gangster Al Capone twice and took the census until
1880.
   As evidence of those events, the Marshals' exhibit contains the
arrest warrant for Geronimo, an 1870 Ku Klux Klan robe and hood from
a recruit in the Klan's birthpace of Pulaski, Tenn., a 1790 whiskey
still from the Whiskey Rebellion era, and one of the two machine
guns from the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago _ the
bloodiest of Prohibition.
   The exhibit, which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2{
years, also includes a Jesse James vest and sidearm, and original
drawings by Wyatt Earp of four gunfights, including one at the OK
Corral involving the legendary wild West marshal.
   Appointed by the president, the 94 district U.S. marshals are a
part of the executive branch, created by the first Congress in the
Judiciary Act of 1789 _ the same law that established the Supreme
Court and the federal judicial system.
   The marshals of the 1980s provide security in federal court and
protect Supreme Court justices when they travel beyond Washington.
They operate the witness protection program that gives new
identities to those whose lives are jeopardized by testifying for
the government, and track down federal fugitives.
   They also take custody of those accused of federal crimes and
transport federal prisoners, running the government's only scheduled
airline service with two Boeing 727s and smaller aircraft out of
their Oklahoma City hub, Morris said.
   They are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs and
other federal crimes and have managed horse ranches, restaurants,
condominums, a golf course and a greenhouse.
   With just 3,000 employees, the service is smaller than the New
York City Police Department, Morris said, yet its ranks are
stationed in every U.S. judicial district from Guam to the Virgin
Islands.

   Funding for counties and grant sizes are reconsidered each year

<HEAD>Politicians Get 520 Pages of Speech Fodder in New Book of Quotes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians stumped for memorable quotations
to enliven their speeches need look no further than ``Respectfully
Quoted,'' a newly published book from the Library of Congress that
is crammed with 2,100 oratorical gems from the past.
   The book might give some comfort to Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a
controversy over cribbed comments.
   If Biden recalls a famous line from President Kennedy's
inaugural address in 1961, he might be intrigued that Lebanese
writer Kahlil Gibran asked much earlier, ``Are you a politician
asking what your country can do for you, or a zealous one asking
what you can do for your country?''
   The book, a three-year project by Suzy Platt of the library's
congressional reference division, is a compilation of quotations
which members of Congress or their staffs over the past 75 years
have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and
origins.
   For the hapless politician scrambling to extricate himself from
trouble, there's this reputed quote from former Republican
presidential candidate George Romney: ``I didn't say that I didn't
say it. I said that I didn't say that I said it. I want to make
that very clear.''
   It was Theodore Roosevelt who cast this verbal harpoon at
President John Tyler: ``He has been called a mediocre man, but this
is unwarranted flattery. He was a politician of monumental
littleness.''
   Exasperation prompted former Rep. George E. Danielson, D-Calif.,
to declare that trying to get answers from Attorney General John N.
Mitchell during House hearings on the Watergate scandal in 1974 was
``like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall.''
   ``These quotations come from the real world of cut-and-thrust
politics,'' says Charles A. Goodrum, former assistant director of
the library's Congressional Research Service, which compiled the
520-page dictionary of political quotes. ``They show the
combination of spirit and humor that represents American political
activity at its best.''
   Ms. Platt amassed verified quotations which researchers began
recording on 3-by-5 cards nearly 50 years ago to avoid
time-consuming duplication of efforts. The CRS handles more than
1,500 requests for information from Congress every day.
   The researchers discovered that some widely used quotes, now
part of American folklore, are impossible to trace to the person
who first uttered them. Other quotes have been mistakenly
attributed to a few legendary orators, such as Abraham Lincoln.
   It has never been verified, they say, that Lincoln _ or P.T.
Barnum _ observed that ``you may fool all the people some of the
time; you can even fool some of the people all the time, but you
can't fool all of the people all the time.''
   Who said, ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing?'' The
library says it wasn't the late Vince Lombardi but Red Sanders,
football coach at Vanderbilt University.
   Goodrum said Congress no longer produces thundering, long-winded
orators of the likes of Daniel Webster, Henry Clay or John C.
Calhoun, and that television's insatiable hunger for 20-second
``sound bites'' is largely to blame.
   ``Today's politicians probably aren't as quotable as the
old-time orators who spoke in the measured cadences of the Bible
and Shakespeare,'' he said. ``Even though their quotes don't stand
up so they can be chiseled on marble as clearly, their speeches
reflect some very incisive thinking about the major issues of our
time.''

Since 1864, each state has been entitled to donate statues of two of its most 
distinguished deceased citizens for permanent exhibit in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state legislature decides who is to be honored, a statue is created and 
accepted by Congress for a place in the National Statuary Hall -- America's 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always anxious to see the statues from their state. But often 
they're surprised and disappointed because they have no idea who (the people) 
depicted in the statues are," said Barbara Wolanin, 46, curator of Statuary 
Hall since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
California's statues, both dedicated on March 1, 1930, are of a minister and a 
priest. It is the only state with two statues of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors recognize Father Junipero Serra, the Franciscan priest who 
established nine California missions before he died in 1784. Father Serra's 
bronze likeness holds a little mission in his left hand, and in the right, a 
cross, held high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Starr King is not so familiar. "What did he do?" Californians typically 
ask when they see the statue. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Unitarian minister, came to California in 1860 from Boston to serve as 
pastor of the First Unitarian Church of San Francisco. It was during the Civil 
War and many Californians favored the Confederacy. Of the more than 100 
newspapers in the state, only 24 supported Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"King traveled throughout California championing the Union cause. He is 
remembered as the man whose matchless oratory kept California in the union," 
curator Wolanin said. 
</P>
<P>
King lived in California only four years before dying at age 40 in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95 statues from 50 states, 14 are of religious leaders, including Father 
Damien (Hawaii), who devoted his life to lepers on Molokai; Father Kino 
(Ariz.), a Jesuit missionary, and Brigham Young (Utah), the Mormon Church 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Five states -- Nevada, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico -- have 
contributed only one statue each. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, Utah became the latest state to present its second statue, a 7-foot-7 
bronze likeness of lanky Philo T. Farnsworth (1906-1971), known as the "Father 
of Television." The statue shows Farnsworth holding one of his first 
cathode-ray tubes. He transmitted his first electronic TV picture in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Ridgecrest Elementary School in Butler, Utah, under the guidance of 
Principal Bruce Barnson, led the effort to put the Farnsworth statue in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll conducted by students, residents favored Farnsworth over 20 
other Utahans, including Eliza Snow, a poet and wife of Brigham Young; Mormon 
Church leader Ezra Taft Benson; hotelier J. Willard Marriott, and heavyweight 
boxing champion Jack Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present for Utah Gov. Norman Bangerter's unveiling of the statue 
was the inventor's 81-year-old widow, Elma (Pem) Farnsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Three statues are of Presidents: George Washington (Va.), Andrew Jackson 
(Tenn.) and James A. Garfield (Ohio). Four are of vice presidents, 36 of U.S. 
senators, 23 of House members, 30 of governors and 32 of military heroes. (Some 
held more than one of these titles.) Six statues honor women: Dr. Florence 
Sabin (Colo.), author of the "Sabin Health Laws" that modernized Colorado's 
public health system; Frances Willard (Ill.), founder of the Women's Christian 
Temperance Union; Marie Sanford (Minn.), educator and champion of women's 
rights; Jeannette Rankin (Mont.), the nation's first congresswoman; Mother 
Joseph (Wash.), a Catholic nun who contributed to the fields of health care, 
education and social work, and Esther Hobart Morris (Wyo.), the first woman to 
hold judicial office in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of four signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of 
six physicians. A king is here -- Kamehameha (Hawaii), and a famed cowboy 
artist -- Charley Russell (Mont.). Oklahoma honors two American Indians: 
Sequoya, inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and Will Rogers, humorist, 
newspaper columnist and movie star. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with Rogers' famous advice to "Always keep an eye on Congress to see 
what they're up to," his statue is the only one facing the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The feet of many of the statues gleam from constant rubbing, "for good luck," 
by visitors. Will Rogers has the shiniest feet of all. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of the president and vice president of the Confederacy, 
Jefferson Davis (Miss.) and Alexander Hamilton Stephens (Ga.), respectively, as 
well as of "Father of Refrigeration" John Gorrie (Fla.), and steamboat inventor 
Robert Fulton (Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
America's best-known historic figures are here as well: Henry Clay (Ky.), Huey 
Long (La.), William Jennings Bryan (Neb.), Daniel Webster (N.H.), Robert E. Lee 
(Va.), Samuel Adams (Mass.), Roger Williams (R.I.), John C. Calhoun (S.C.), Sam 
Houston and Stephen Austin (Tex.), and Ethan Allen (Vt.). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lesser known include Jabez Curry (Ala.), Uriah Rose (Ark.), Edmund 
K. Smith (Fla.), George Shoup (Ida.), Samuel Kirkwood (Iowa), George Glick 
(Kan.), Zachariah Chandler (Mich.), Zebulon Vance (N.C.) and Jason Lee (Ore.). 
Most visitors to Statuary Hall have no idea who they were, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people pass away who are much more famous than many in Statuary Hall, 
but the states are stuck with those selected at an earlier time," longtime 
Capitol guide Madeline Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Statuary Hall is in a part of the Capitol completed in 1807, a domed 
semicircular room with sandstone walls and breccia marble columns, a room that 
housed the House of Representatives until 1857, when the House moved to its 
present, larger chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed a bill in 1864 to create the National Statuary Hall to house 
two marble or bronze statues from each state "of deceased persons illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services." 
</P>
<P>
In 1870, Rhode Island contributed the first statue, Revolutionary War hero 
Nathaniel Greene. By the turn of the century, 23 were on exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
By 1933, there were 65 statues crowded into Statuary Hall, and it became clear 
that the floor would not support any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was then decided to keep most of the collection in the hall and place the 
others in prominent sites throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statues no longer stand in the same room, this gathering of heroes 
-- famous or not -- continues to be called National Statuary Hall.

<TEXT>
   For nearly two centuries, society's
highest and mightiest flocked to this Allegheny Mountain resort to
sip the natural mineral water and soak up elegance at one of
America's oldest spas.
   But the Bedford Springs Hotel is foundering these days as its
owners struggle to repay debts and avoid the auction block.
   ``We have the ability to revive something historic and to spur
the economy, and that should sound like government funding would be
available to do that,'' said Hobert Hobbs, 50, vice president of Sky
Group International Inc., which owns the hotel.
   Unless an investor comes to the rescue, the resort will be
auctioned off Sept. 21, nine days before $4.8 million is due the
bank. The money is what was spent from a $7.5 million loan made in
1987 for renovations that weren't completed because of a dispute
between owners that ended up in bankruptcy court.
   Local folks fear that a new owner will raze the 185-year-old
hotel or modernize it to the point that all ambience is lost.
   Merchants in neighboring Bedford, a town of about 4,000 people
brimming with antique and art shops, say business already is off 20
percent to 25 percent as a result of the hotel turmoil. Tourism
accounts for about a third of the area's income, according to Joe
Lurie, executive director of the Bedford County Office of Economic
Development.
   ``It's like losing a big industry,'' he said.
   A few years ago, nearly 200 people worked at Bedford Springs
Hotel, a stately stretch of three- and four-story buildings on 2,300
acres in south-central Pennsylvania. They tended an 18-hole golf
course, tennis courts, a stocked lake, and hiking and riding trails
during the May-through-October season.
   Forty-seven employees are left. All but 66 of the hotel's 244
rooms are closed to guests, who dine at the golf clubhouse because
the main kitchen is shut down.
   Eight guest rooms were occupied on a recent weeknight, leaving
doorman Joe Koontz with little to do except read.
   ``They (guests) ask me what's going to happen next. Well I don't
know what's going to happen next,'' said Koontz, 61.
   Bedford Springs Hotel's troubles, in part, reflect those of the
entire industry, according to industry observers.
   ``The hotel industry is in deep trouble all around the country,
big time. There are 45 percent more rooms than demand in the whole
United States. It's an overbuilt industry,'' said Phil Goodman,
president of Western Media Corp., a marketing company in San Diego.
   Edward Watkins, editor of Lodging Hospitality, a monthly trade
magazine, estimates about 50 of the nation's 45,000 hotels and
motels are ``old-line resorts,'' which offer traditional types of
recreation in a spread-out, rural setting with a meal plan. Only a
dozen or so are 100 years old or more.
   ``The traditional guest they served is getting old and dying
off,'' he said.
   The Bedford Springs Hotel was opened in 1804 by a doctor drawn by
the area's magnesia springs and their reputed curative powers. The
springs had been used for centuries before by Indians.
   The spa quickly attracted the notables of the times: Mrs. John
Quincy Adams and her daughters, Aaron Burr, and statesmen Henry
Clay, John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster.
   President James Polk visited in 1848 followed by five other
presidents, including James Buchanan, who used the spa as a summer
White House. Candidate Ronald Reagan stayed overnight in 1974.
   The U.S. Supreme Court met at the resort to decide a case in
1855, the only time it ever met outside its chambers. And it was
there in 1858 that Buchanan received the first Trans-Atlantic cable,
a message from England's Queen Victoria.
   During World War II, the Navy established a radio training school
at the resort. The hotel also housed Japanese diplomats.
   Bedford Springs is being considered, along with State College, as
a possible summer home for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
   Hobbs and community leaders hope the orchestra's interest will
prompt the bank to grant a delay on payment of the loan.
   ``We're still confident something good is going to happen,''
Hobbs said. ``Was it Yogi Berra who said, `It ain't over til it's
over?' Well it ain't over til it's over.'''

   Charles Wiltse, a historian who was
considered a leading biographical expert on 19th century America,
has died at the age of 83.
   Wiltse died Tuesday at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic after
suffering a heart attack, said John Wilson of Rand-Wilson Funeral
Home.
   Wiltse edited the papers of Daniel Webster, the prominent
congressman and secretary of state, in a 16-volume work completed
last year. He also was an expert on one of Webster's
contemporaries, statesman and Vice President John Calhoun. In the
1940s he prepared a three-volume set on Calhoun's papers.
   He was the author of ``The Jeffersonian Tradition in American
Democracy'' and ``The New Nation 1800-1845,'' as well as many
articles on the history of the period.
   He was a professor of history at Dartmouth College from 1966 to
1972, before retiring from teaching.
   Wiltse was born in San Francisco, and was a 1929 graduate of
West Virginia University. He earned a Ph.D. at Cornell University
in 1932.
   He is survived by a sister, Clara Wiltse of Muncie, Ind. His
wife died in 1985.

   The Trouble With Veeps

   Though presidential-primary results have yet to register,
it's a sure bet that politicians are already scheming and
cajoling behind the scenes in the hopes of landing the No. 2
spot on the 1992 ticket -- the Republican one, too. This
alone shows how far the much-maligned vice presidency has
come since Daniel Webster, in spurning the Whig nomination in
1848, explained: "I do not propose to be buried until I am
dead."
   Following John C. Calhoun, who was elected the seventh
vice president in 1825, no vice president was nominated to a
second term by a party convention until James S. Sherman, in
1912. As syndicated columnist Jules Witcover puts it in
"Crapshoot: Rolling the Dice on the Vice Presidency" (Crown,
450 pages, $25), through most of our history, the office was
a "certifiable dead end."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judging by the dreadful bill of particulars Mr. Witcover
has assembled, this was a good thing. The overwhelming
majority of U.S. veeps have been dim, crooked, lowly and
loutish. Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, was indicted
for murder and tried for treason. Both of Ulysses S. Grant's
running mates, Schuyler Colfax and Henry Wilson, were
implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandal. Calvin Coolidge
was counting on his veep, Charles Dawes, to break a tie in a
crucial Senate vote -- but Dawes slept through it.
   Herbert Hoover's No. 2, Charles Curtis, was nicknamed
"Egg" for his wheeling and dealing for the poultry industry.
Under Franklin Roosevelt, the pro-Soviet Henry Wallace liked
to denounce American businessmen as "midget Hitlers." In a
delicious bit of foreshadowing, the New York Times once said
of Woodrow Wilson's vice president, Indiana Gov. Thomas
Marshall, "If Indiana cannot raise men of presidential
caliber, she should at least try to train them to keep
silence when they have not the mental equipment to fit them
for an understanding of what is required."
   But dating from the tenure of Harry Truman, a scorned vice
president who turned out to be a heroic Cold War leader, the
vice presidency itself has been no joke (the current occupant
notwithstanding). Five of the past nine presidents had first
served as vice presidents, and in six of the past seven
national elections both nominees had first been presidential
understudies. Three -- Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford
-- rose to the top spot following presidential death or
disgrace.
   The enhanced chance of today's vice president becoming
tomorrow's president has Mr. Witcover worried. He sees danger
in the slipshod selection process and the indifference of the
electorate.
   The fact is that advances in medicine and security make
the odds of a president dying or being killed in office
slimmer today than in 1850. As for the vice presidency's
giving candidates a leg up in the race for the presidency,
this is due to television exposure and the ability to raise
money. In other words, it is due to politics; Mr. Witcover
writes as though vice presidents ascend through black magic.
   Still, it is deplorable that presidential candidates
continue to select running mates with little regard for their
worthiness as successors: John F. Kennedy, for instance,
tapped Johnson because he wanted Mike Mansfield to be Senate
majority leader rather than the treacherous LBJ. Richard
Nixon chose candidates who wouldn't outshine him, Spiro Agnew
and Mr. Ford. George McGovern, turned down by his first two
choices and unable to reach the third on the telephone,
picked the eventually discredited Sen. Thomas Eagleton on a
lark, thus ensuring that background checks would be part of
all future selections.
   George Bush was no different from the pack in his choice
of Dan Quayle. But Mr. Witcover's partisanship keeps him from
recognizing this, as he insists against his own evidence that
Mr. Quayle is uniquely unfit for higher office. He gives us
surely the most exhaustive list of Mr. Quayle's gaffes in
print, but his portrait of the man is cursory and flat, and
he has almost nothing to say about Mr. Quayle's substantive
record in the vice presidency, which is more impressive than
most of his predecessors'. (Even the Washington Post has
recognized this, leaving Mr. Witcover trailing behind the
Beltway's sluggish conventional wisdom.)
   One does not have to be a fan of Mr. Quayle's to see that
Mr. Witcover's huffing and puffing comes down to this: "What
if Quayle, feeling his oats and prodded by his right-wing
constituency, brought in more doctrinaire conservatives to
restore the Reagan Revolution they feel was abandoned by
Bush?" Personally, I think it would be pretty wonderful.
   The author is angry that the voters didn't punish Mr. Bush
for his choice. But for better or worse, vice presidents have
hardly ever made a difference one way or the other on
Election Day. To remedy this, Mr. Witcover wants to rob
voters of their right not to care. A new president would
submit his or her vice presidential nominee to Congress for
confirmation after the election, thereby eliminating
"blatantly political considerations" now impinging on the
choice. The idea that Congress could make a decision free of
partisan politics, much less of character assassination, is
one that could only be held by a liberal Washington
columnist.

   At 400 pounds, Sen. Dixon Hall Lewis of Alabama
was the weightiest person ever to serve in Congress.
   Lewis, a Democrat who served first in the House, then in the
Senate, was so heavy he had difficulty finding a carriage driver
willing to take the risk of hauling all those pounds.
   Once, wrote Isaac Bassett, the Senate's assistant doorkeeper for
much of the 19th century, Lewis ``got into a hack and went right
through the bottom, onto the ground _ and if the horses had not been
very tame he would have been killed.''
   Sen. Lewis _ and the extreme rotundity of his profile _ is
presiding this summer over the marble-clad rotunda of the Russell
Senate Office Building, looming from a balcony in the form of a
giant, shadow-casting silhouette.
   Lewis and the silhouettes of six of his senatorial colleagues of
his era form the somewhat whimsical background of an exhibit
illustrating the triumph and travail experienced by the Senate in
its first 100 years, 1789-1889.
   Born in 1802, Lewis served in the House for 15 years. He was
appointed to the Senate in 1844, dying four years later.
   Bassett, who made good use of his powers of observation during
his 60 years of service to the Senate, noted that Lewis rarely rose
from his specially constructed and commodious chair to address the
Senate.
   Bassett wrote that Lewis told him the reason ``was that he was so
big and fat that I would have to fan him, and it would not look very
dignified in such a body as the Senate.''
   But if Lewis was an infrequent speaker, he did listen intently to
the major addresses of others.
   On Jan. 26, 1830, he walked across the Capitol and joined the
throng crowding into the chamber of the Senate, determined to hear
Sen. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts defend the federal union.
   The ``enormous'' congressman was given a seat in the tiny lobby
behind the presiding officer's chair where he became wedged in by
other spectators.
   Because he was separated from the chamber by a painted glass
screen, he could hear Webster but could not see him.
   Describing the scene, Bassett said the frustrated congressman
``deliberately pulled out his knife and removed the obstructing
paint on the glass.''
   But the operation ``caused quite a noise,'' Bassett said.
``Everybody was looking to see where that scratching came from.''
   Finally, Bassett said, Lewis cleared an area ``as large as a
man's hand,'' obtaining a ``good view'' of the famous Webster.
   The senatorial silhouettes, originally made on paper during the
1840s and 1850s and now reproduced larger than life, bring together
an unuusal cast of characters.
   Joining Lewis in larger-than-life profile is, for example, Sen.
John Randolph of Virginia, a thin, stick-like figure described as
``one of the most brilliant, deranged and pathetic men ever to serve
in the Senate.''
   Randolph was known to stride into the Senate followed by a pack
of hunting hounds while flicking a riding crop and drinking a cup of
beer.
   Abusive in speech, he once provoked a duel with Sen. Henry Clay
from which both men emerged unscathed.
   Randolph lived to be 99, dying in 1833 just days before his 100th
birthday.
   Also on the railing above the rotunda floor is a far less
colorful lawmaker, Sen. Felix Grundy of Tennessee, who was described
by doorkeeper Bassett as a consummate insider and master of
parliamentary tactics.
   Near Grundy is Sen. John Forsyth of Georgia who cut a more
visible public swath with blistering oratory and cutting wit.
   Informed that President Andrew Jackson's opponents were forming
the new Whig party, Forsyth remarked:
   ``It is a glorious name, and I have no doubt they will disgrace
it.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Senate Barbers Shaved Senators _ and Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shave and a haircut used to cost nothing, if
you were a United States senator and were shaved and trimmed in the
United States Senate barber shop.
   And when one reform-minded senator tried to eliminate free
senatorial shaving and hair cutting 37 years ago, his
shaved-for-free colleagues rebelled.
   The senator was the late Paul Douglas of Illinois, and his
experience was recalled in a recent Senate speech by Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Douglas had gone to the Senate barber shop for a haircut.
   ``After the barber had done his work,'' said Dole, ``Douglas
began to think that his income was ample enough to pay for his own
haircut _ which then cost a dollar and a quarter _ and not charge
it to the taxpayer.''
   So Douglas introduced an amendment to the annual legislative
appropriations act to cut off funds for the barber shop unless it
began charging senators for its services.
   The counterattack was not long coming.
   At a Senate hearing, Sen. Carl Hayden of Arizona complimented
Douglas on his haircut, then recalled that the haircut issue was
one that flared from time to time.
   Hayden said that when he first came to the Senate he became
disturbed at newspaper articles complaining about free senatorial
haircuts and discussed the matter with Senate veteran William Borah
of Idaho.
   ``Senator Borah said, `You tell that reporter to go to the
devil. I want the same service that was received here by Henry Clay
and John C. Calhoun.'''
   Dole picked up the story, saying, ``After a good laugh, the
Senate shouted down Senator Douglas' amendment, and the free
haircut survived.''
   But only for the monent.
   ``I want to assure taxpayers that today senators pay their own
way when they have their hair cut, as Senator Douglas tried and
failed to accomplish 37 years ago,'' Dole said.
   While they pay more than a dollar and a quarter, the Senate
barbering charges may be a bit gentler than those of most
commercial barbershops.
   The current charge for a haircut in the Senate barbershop is
$4.50.
   More elaborate cuts are $6.50. Hair styling costs $9.00.
   A shave costs $4.00.

   During debate on a major drug bill earlier this month, Rep.
Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., resorted to a ruffle of rhetorical
flourishes to introduce the next speaker, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill.
   ``At this time I would would like to recognize for eight minutes
the chairman of the awesome and powerful Ways and Means Committee,
one of the most distinguished leaders that we have in this
Congress, Mr. Rostenkowski from Illinois.''
   ``The awesome chairman is recognized,'' said Rep. Bob Carr,
D-Mich., who was presiding.

   Those last hearings before the confirmation of Justice
Thomas were a sordid spectacle. It may not be entirely
Pollyannaish, however, to note certain useful byproducts. The
nation's consciousness on the subject of sexual harassment
was significantly raised; about time, too. Moreover, the
television audience saw a succession of competent, posed,
well-spoken black witnesses who disagreed among themselves;
this should undermine the David Duke impression that black
leaders all dress up in African costumes and spout a racial
party line while the rank and file mug people in the streets.
   That about exhausts the good news. The hearings provoked
widespread titillation and disgust. Our national
self-righteousness demands a scapegoat, anyone but ourselves,
and is finding it in Congress. The Thomas confirmation
hearings come as a culmination of a series of scandals on the
Hill -- overdrafts at the House bank, unpaid bills at the
House restaurant, free massages in the House gym, fixed
parking tickets, junkets abroad, wine, women and song --
practices in which the rest of the population of course never
indulges. According to the New York Times/CBS News Poll, a
sizable number of Americans now see their national
legislators as generally pampered, arrogant and crooked.

   Most of the practices under criticism are indeed
objectionable; and it is quite reasonable to hold members of
Congress to higher standards than we hold investment bankers,
stock manipulators, savings and loan operators and other
emblems of the private sector. Certainly the Senate Judiciary
Committee did not distinguish itself in the Thomas hearings.
   Yet it is a little hard, it seems to me, to place all the
blame for the mess on the Senate. Surely a considerable share
must go to the man who presented the Senate with such a
dubious nomination. The Supreme Court today is the most
undistinguished in my lifetime. In the past, presidents have
sought out people of national experience and distinction for
elevation to the court -- cabinet members, senators,
governors, eminent jurists, leaders of the bar, great legal
scholars. Even the reactionary justices who tried to kill the
New Deal half a century ago included men of intellectual
force like George Sutherland, Willis Vandevanter and Owen
Roberts. Today dimness seems almost a prerequisite for
appointment.
   Clarence Thomas is the third mediocrity in a row. It was a
cynical choice. The president called him "the best man for
the job on the merits" and denied that his race was a
consideration. But had Clarence Thomas been a white man with
the same qualifications, it is not very likely that he would
have been appointed. The opponent of affirmative action
ironically became the beneficiary of affirmative action.
   All presidents naturally enough appoint justices who they
believe will give their own views of public policy a
sympathetic hearing. But responsible presidents also have
some regard for the Supreme Court as an institution. When
their own predilections command a safe majority, they
sometimes take care to preserve the court's appearance of
impartiality by providing for other viewpoints. A rigidly
ideological and partisan Supreme Court loses credibility and
falls into discredit. That is what happened to the "nine old
men" in the 1930s. Balance is a reasonable consideration in
making appointments for life to the highest court in the
land.
   Thus Herbert Hoover, even if with reluctance, appointed
the great liberal justice Benjamin Cardozo. Franklin
Roosevelt made Calvin Coolidge's attorney general his chief
justice. Harry Truman appointed Harold Burton, a Republican.
Dwight Eisenhower appointed William Brennan, a Democrat. But
Mr. Bush is not a lawyer and does not perhaps fully
appreciate the role of the court. One fears that he regards
judicial appointments as a convenient way of getting the hard
right off his back and thereby gaining a free hand on matters
that really interest him, like foreign policy. Had he
nominated someone like John Harlan or Lewis Powell or his
good friend Potter Stewart, none of this mess would have
happened.
   In the meantime, everyone is mad at Congress; and the
remedy of choice these days is term limitation. A number of
states have already adopted term limitation for their own
legislatures. Some states seek to impose limitations on their
representatives in Congress as well -- a proposal of highly
dubious constitutionality, even given the present court.
According to the Gallup Poll, 70% of American voters wish to
limit congressional terms.
   The argument is that limitation to a maximum 12 years of
service in either house would end the seniority system, shift
Congress from constituent service to policy-making,
revitalize party competition, ensure a constant influx of new
legislators with new ideas and force legislators to pay
attention to the national interest rather than to their own
re-election.
   Well, perhaps. But the most certain result would be to
tilt the balance of the constitutional system even more in
favor of the executive. It is hard to imagine a greater boon
for the Imperial Presidency than to purge Congress of
experienced legislators who are specialists in issues, who
know the workings of government and who remember where bodies
are buried. What president would not prefer a revolving-door
Congress filled with amateurs learning the ropes from scratch
and condemned to vanish when they have gained the experience
to be effective? Alas, it is not true, as William Jennings
Bryan is supposed to have said, that any man with sufficient
goodness of heart can write a currency bill.
   The Founding Fathers considered and rejected proposals of
term limitation. They were right to do so. It would have made
quite a difference to American history if such limitations
had ended after 12 years the careers of such illustrious
legislators as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun,
Thomas Hart Benton, Charles Sumner, James G. Blaine, Henry
Cabot Lodge, Robert M. LaFollette, George W. Norris, Sam
Rayburn, Robert P. Wagner, William E. Borah, Arthur
Vandenberg, George Aiken, Robert A. Taft, Jacob Javits and so
many others.
   Term limitations would bounce from our present Congress
Tom Foley, Lee Hamilton, Sam Nunn, Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
Richard Lugar, Bill Bradley, Stephen Solarz, Bill Green,
Charles Rangel, Tom Downey, Bob Michel, Dick Gephardt, Les
Aspin and other skilled legislators. Their replacement by
fresh-faced and untutored novices would unquestionably
increase presidential power, but would it really improve the
performance of the American government?
   One hears that the automatic return of incumbents is a
horrid new phenomenon. But recall the election of 1790, where
38 out of 41 incumbent congressmen were reelected; or 1792,
when all 45 incumbents were re-elected; or 1866, when 85% of
the incumbents seeking re-election made it; or 1934, when 388
members ran and 325 were re-elected.
   Throughout American history, according to the
authoritative study by David Huckabee, the proportion of
House incumbents running for re-election who were returned to
office has dropped below 70% only seven times and has
exceeded 80% most of the time. As Mr. Huckabee concludes,
"Incumbents who have sought reelection apparently have always
been relatively successful." As for the alleged tyranny of
incumbency today, hardly half of today's senators were
senators 10 years ago, and less than half the members of the
House were members 10 years ago.
   When you think about it, the whole idea of term
limitations is profoundly anti-democratic. It assumes that
the quest for reelection corrupts legislators and that they
will better serve the national interest when they ignore the
wishes of their constituents. It assumes that the less
accountable a member of Congress is to popular desires and
needs, the better legislator he will be. It assumes, in
short, that the democratic process itself is the enemy of the
public interest.
   Surely a democracy requires a legislature that listens to
the people, not a legislature that couldn't care less about
the people. The desire to be re-elected, as Alexander
Hamilton wrote in the 72nd Federalist, gives the elected
official "the inclination and the resolution to act his part
well" and gives the voters opportunity to assess his
performance. When they approve his conduct, they can
"continue him in his office, in order to prolong the utility
of his talents and virtues, and to secure to the government
the advantage of permanency in a wise system of
administration." Term limitation, Hamilton said, "would be a
diminution of the inducements to good behavior." It would
increase "the temptation to sordid view, to peculation, and,
in some instances, to usurpation."
   If democratic government is about anything, it is about
the unfettered right of the voters to choose those who govern
them. Term limitation, by assuming that voters are too dumb
to choose wisely, is an insult to the people. Term
limitation, by weakening the power of the legislative branch
to counterbalance the executive branch, would be an injury to
the republic. And term limitation distracts attention from
the search for answers to the very grave substantive problems
that afflict and enfeeble the nation.

   United States marshals live in legend as the
men who tamed the Wild West, but their 200-year career is
intertwined with more of the country's history than just bringing
bandits to justice.
   The country's oldest law enforcement organization looks back at
its storied history today as it begins a bicentennial celebration
with the opening of an exhibit at the Supreme Court and a black-tie
gala at a nearby hotel.
   ``At almost every point in history when the federal government
was involved in a significant event, there were marshals
participating,'' says Stephen Boyle, a spokesman for the U.S.
Marshals Service.
   A marshal fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a
homestead in the Oklahoma land run of 1889; marshals guarded the
first black student at the University of Mississippi during the
desegregation battles of the 1960s; they ringed the Pentagon during
the Vietnam war protests of the early 1970s.
   They smashed whiskey stills during Prohibition and arrested
gangster Al Capone twice; took the census until 1880; captured
fugitive slaves before the Civil War and protected freed slaves
during Reconstruction; and did the hanging for ``Hanging Judge''
Isaac Parker in Fort Smith, Ark., when Oklahoma was still Indian
Territory and bank and train robbers hid in the brush.
   ``This is our heritage, the preservation of history,'' said Clint
Peoples of Waco, Texas. Peoples is the executive marshal for the
bicentennial, and served as a marshal for 15 years in North Texas
and as chief of the Texas Rangers.
   Sponsored by the United States Marshals Foundation, a non-profit
fund-raising organization, the special guest at tonight's event will
be James Arness, who played Marshal Matt Dillon on television's
``Gunsmoke'' for 20 years. One of those being honored is Deputy
Marshal Rey F. Cestero of Savannah, Ga., for his assistance in
apprehending two murder and abduction suspects in August.
   Included in the exhibit, organized with the help of the
Smithsonian Institution, are the arrest warrant for Geronimo, an
1870 Ku Klux Klan robe from the Klan's birthplace of Pulaski, Tenn.,
a 1790 still from the Whiskey Rebellion era, and one of the two
machine guns from the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago _ the
bloodiest of Prohibition.
   The exhibit, which will tour a dozen cities over the next 2{
years, also includes a Jesse James vest and sidearm, and original
drawings by the legendary Wyatt Earp of four gunfights including one
at the OK Corral.
   During their first 100 years, marshals ``were the federal
government at the local level,'' says marshals historian Frederick
S. Calhoun. ``There was no infrastructure of a bureaucracy, so when
the citizens got mad, they took it out on the federal marshals.''
   Partly as a result, at least 400 and as many as 700 people in the
Marshals Service died in the line of duty, more casualties than in
any other law enforcement agency, officials say. The reason they
lack specific numbers is that officials are unsure whether all those
who died had been deputized or were simply parts of posses and that
``makes it very fuzzy,'' said Stanley Morris, director of the
Marshals Service.
   Appointed by the president, the 94 U.S. marshals are a part of
the executive branch, created by the first Congress in the Judiciary
Act of 1789 _ the same law that established the federal judicial
system.
   The marshals of the 1980s provide security in federal courts, and
protect Supreme Court justices when they travel beyond Washington.
They track down federal fugitives and operate the witness protection
program that gives new identities to those whose lives are
jeopardized by testifying for the government.
   They also are responsible for property seized in the war on drugs
and other federal offenses, and currently have three-quarters of a
billion dollars in their inventory, Boyle said. Marshals have
managed horse ranches, restaurants, condominiums, a golf course and
a greenhouse taken in such raids.
   With just the 94 marshals, aided by some 2,000 deputies and about
1,000 support staff, the service is smaller than the New York City
Police Department, Morris said, yet its ranks are spread across
every U.S. judicial district from Guam to the Virgin Islands.
   Calhoun, who has a doctorate in history from the University of
Chicago, says the deadliest era in the service's history was before
Oklahoma statehood, when about 100 marshals died in Indian territory
between 1872 and 1896.
   ``With the exception of Indian Territory, the far most dangerous
time to be a marshal was in the South after the Civil War,'' Calhoun
said. ``If the Ku Klux Klan didn't get you, the moonshiners did.''

<HL> The First 'Heartbeat Away' Succession </HL>

   Whether Dan Quayle or Lloyd Bentsen becomes vice president, the precise duties of the position they are seeking will be, as always, unclear. 
But the job does carry with it a sobering potential responsibility: to succeed the president in case of death, resignation or impeachment. 

   This fact has given vital significance to the public scrutiny of Messrs. 
Quayle and Bentsen and to their debate last week. 
But for the first 50 years of our nation's history, the position of vice president held no such importance: According to the way many political leaders of those years read the Constitution, there was no clear line of succession. 
No president had died in office, so the issue never had come up. 

   However, when the ninth president, William Henry Harrison, died a month after taking office in 1841, there arose around his vice president, John Tyler, one of the fiercest political controversies in U.S. history. 
There was, of course, no precedent for whether the vice president should be accorded the full power of the president or be regarded simply as acting chief executive. 
And the Constitution's language contributed to the problem, stating that "in case of the removal of the President from office or his death, resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president." 

   Did "the same" mean the office or the duties? 
Tyler said it meant the office, but his interpretation was not accepted by all Whig or Democratic leaders, newspaper editors or even his own inherited cabinet. 
Many maintained that the Founding Fathers did not intend the office to devolve on the vice president, just the duties. 

   Despite the doubts, Tyler acted decisively. 
Harrison died at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday, April 4. 
Tyler, who had returned to his home in Williamsburg following the inauguration, rode 53 hours on horseback after receiving the news of Harrison's death. 
He reached Washington around 5 a.m. Tuesday, April 6, convinced that he was the actual president, not an ad interim administrator. 
He felt the oath that he had taken as vice president was sufficient to assume the office of president, but in order to forestall any problems, he took a second oath. 
He was sworn into office by William Cranch, chief judge of the circuit court of Washington, D.C. Chief Justice Roger Taney was nearby in Baltimore, but refused to administer the oath because he hadn't been officially requested to do so. 

   As a vice presidential candidate on the Whig ticket, Tyler had done little campaigning, and he was not perceived as an important leader by politicians or the public. 
In fact, in the famous 1840 campaign slogan -- "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too" -- his name came as a sort of afterthought. 
As vice president, he had been expected to have little responsibility. 

   Now that he claimed the presidency, he met strong resistance, especially from former President John Quincy Adams, who insisted that Tyler was merely an "acting president." 
Adams felt Tyler's ascent to the presidency was "in direct violation both of grammar and context of the Constitution." 

   Certainly the Whigs were stunned by the turn of events. 
In Tyler, they found themselves with a party leader who subscribed to few, if any, of their policies. 
Tyler had been a Democrat and was still a Democrat at heart who supported states' rights and opposed a national bank, in direct contrast to the beliefs of Henry Clay, the most powerful Whig. 

   Tyler held firm and won the day, although nearly six weeks after taking office his official status was still being questioned by Congress. 
On May 31, New York Rep. John McKeon rose in the House to inquire if Tyler was indeed officially the "president." 

   Not surprisingly, Tyler's nearly four-year term as president was a stormy one. 
He was constantly at odds with the Whigs, who controlled both houses. 
They were especially angered by his repeated vetoes of the national bank and high-tariff bills. 
Eventually, the Whigs disowned and denounced him, leading Henry Clay to call him the "president without a party." 

   Dissatisfaction with Tyler eventually led to impeachment proceedings against him, the first president to be so dubiously honored. 
The impeachment resolution, however, was defeated, 127-83, in the House. 

   Despite all his problems, Tyler decided to run for re-election in 1844 as a Democrat. 
He was nominated at a Baltimore convention, but was persuaded to withdraw from the campaign several months later. 
This move was thought to have helped elect Democrat "dark horse" James Polk while defeating Tyler's nemesis Henry Clay.

   ``Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be
true or not, I can say for one that I have no other so great as
that of being truly esteemed of my fellow man, by rendering myself
worthy of their esteem.'' _ Abraham Lincoln.

   When Abraham Lincoln received the Republican
Party's nomination for president in 1860, the New York Herald
dismissed him as a ``fourth-rate lecturer, who cannot speak good
grammar, and who, to raise the wind, delivers his hackneyed,
illiterate compositions at $200 apiece.''
   The man later compared to Mark Twain for his gift with the
English language was nicknamed Ignoramus Abe, Old Scoundrel and
Filthy Story-Teller.
   ``I have endured a great deal of ridicule without much malice
and received a great deal of kindness not quite free of ridicule,''
Lincoln once said, referring to the condescending treatment his
homespun style received even from friends.
   But historians have seen him differently, finding richness in
the language of a poor, country lawyer. The Library of America,
which has previously published the works of Twain, Henry James and
other celebrated writers, is honoring Lincoln with a two-volume,
$35 publication of his speeches and letters: ``Lincoln: Speeches
and Writings 1832-1858'' and ``Lincoln: Speeches and Writings
1859-1865.''
   ``How do we define literature?'' asked editor Don E.
Fehrenbacher, author of ``Lincoln in Text and Context: Collected
Essays,'' and ``The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American
Law and Politics,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in
1979.
   ``He is able to write in such a way as to express deep emotion
under artistic control. That's what we look for in a (Ernest)
Hemingway or in a Henry James, and that's what we get in Lincoln's
best works.
   ``That combination of something fundamental to say that goes
beyond mere intellect. There is artistry in his letters, that ear
for the English language.''
   The author of the Gettysburg Address composed all his own
speeches despite spending only 12 months in school. He was part
philosopher, part politician, part poet. His influences included
Shakespeare, the King James version of the Bible and long-time
Speaker of the House Henry Clay, whose dealmaking earned him the
nickname ``The Great Compromiser.''
   Lincoln was a progressive pragmatist. He staked his political
career on opposition to slavery, but tempered that with assurances
that blacks would be better off living in their own country once
freed. ``I have no desire to own a slave or to marry one'' was how
he summed up his position.
   He first presented himself as lagging sadly behind _ a
reluctant, almost embarrassed public servant, more familiar with
the straight path back to his Kentucky log cabin on Nolan Creek
than the winding, uphill climb to the White House.
   In an open letter to the people of Illinois' Sangamon County,
published March 9, 1832, Lincoln offered sincere, cut-and-dry
analyses of local issues as he urged consideration for election to
the Illinois General Assembly and concluded with a near apology for
taking up the voters' time.
   He was born Feb. 12, 1809, the second child of pioneer farmer
and carpenter Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln. He was just 2
when his family moved out of the log cabin to a 230-acre farm on
Knob Creek, 11 miles northeast of Hodgenville, Ky.
   In his early 20s, after the family moved to Indiana and then to
Illinois, Lincoln made his home outside Decatur, Ill., and gave his
first known political speech in 1830, favoring improved navigation
on the Sangamon River.
   In 1834, a year after he was appointed postmaster of New Salem,
he was elected as a Whig to the Illinois House of Representatives
and served four terms. During that time, he received a license to
practice law and began his public opposition to slavery.
   ``The main routes upwards for men who were not well born were
law and politics,'' Fehrenbacher explained. ``There weren't that
many openings, and politics were much more central in those days.
The crowds came out and listened for hours.''
   Elected to Congress in 1846, Lincoln served just one term,
bitterly questioning President James K. Polk's use of troops in the
Mexican War. He left Washington after failing to receive an
appointment from the administration of President Zachary Taylor, a
fellow Whig.
   His life in politics seemingly over, Lincoln practiced law in
Springfield, where he lived with his wife, the former Mary Todd,
whom he married in 1842, and three sons, Robert Todd, Tad and
Willie (a fourth son, Edward, died at age 3).
   The slavery issue had apparantly been settled in 1820 when Clay
helped craft the Missouri Compromise, which allowed the South to
keep slaves but required abolition in a large section of
territories in the Midwest. The agreement, however, fell apart in
1854 when Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed
the anti-slavery language of the Missouri Compromise in favor of
``local sovereignty.''
   An enraged Lincoln, insisting that ``the spirit of '76'' and
``the spirit of Nebraska, are utter antagonisms,'' cut back on his
promising legal work and set his sights on the U.S. Senate.
   Thus was born the most famous political rivalry of the time:
Lincoln, the gangly, moody proponent of abolition, and Illinois
Sen. Stephen Douglas, the squat, gregarious author of the
Kansas-Nebraska Act and a powerful Northern Democrat.
   In 1856, Lincoln helped found the Republican Party of Illinois,
which opposed slavery. He warned two years later that ``a house
divided against itself cannot stand,'' anticipating that the United
States could not remain intact with conflicting laws.
   Fehrenbacher said the Lincoln-Douglas debates, included in their
entirety in the two-volume compilation, made Lincoln a national
figure.
   Thousands attended each of the seven confrontations, all held
outdoors, and frequently interrupted the speeches with loud
applause and cries of encouragement. The format was broken into
three parts: a one-hour opening statement, a 1{-hour reply and a
half-hour rejoinder.
   Slavery was virtually the only issue. Douglas made overtly
racist appeals and insisted the government was ``made for the
benefit of white men and their posterity for ever.''
   Said Lincoln:
   ``You say it must not be opposed in the free States, because
slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the slaves States,
because it is there; it must not be opposed in politics, because
that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in the pulpit,
because it is not religion. Then where is the place to oppose it?''
   Douglas won the election, but Lincoln was pleased enough with
the debates to have them published the following year.
   In the 1860 presidential campaign, with the Democrats badly
splintered, the election broke down into two regional campaigns:
Lincoln vs. Douglas in the North, and John C. Breckinridge vs. John
Bell in the South.

   The U.S. Tax Court has upheld an IRS order
denying a tax exemption to a South Carolina private school on
grounds it discriminates against blacks.
   ``The absence of either a single black student in the school or
a plausible explanation of inability to attract black students
permits an inference of discrimination, particularly in view of ...
(the school's) history,'' the court held.
   The decision, made public Monday, means that contributions to
Calhoun Academy in St. Matthews, S.C., are not deductible.
   Chief Judge Arthur L. Nims III held that although Calhoun had
adopted a racially non-discriminatory policy, the school had failed
to operate under that policy.
   ``We cannot conclude that non-discrimination in ... operations
is more likely than discrimination,'' Nims wrote for the court.
   Calhoun, organized as a not-for-profit corporation Dec. 30,
1969, offers classes for grades kindergarten through 12. The school
has never had a black pupil or teacher. Two black parents requested
and were given application forms for enrollment in 1984-85, but a
black teacher has never applied for employment.
   Since 1982, at least one pupil of Oriental background has been
enrolled in Calhoun. The only non-white teacher, a
Japanese-American, was hired in 1983, court records showed.
   The school amended its charter in 1985 and began advertising
that it did not discriminate. It applied to the Internal Revenue
Service for a tax exemption in 1986.
   The IRS denied the exemption, citing the fact that Calhoun was
formed at a time of enforced desegregation in area public schools,
its total lack of black pupils despite blacks being a majority in
Calhoun County and its failure to announce a policy of
non-discrimination until 1985.
   At a later meeting, the IRS suggested that Calhoun improve its
contacts with the black community and offer reduced tuition for
black pupils. A director of the school rejected the reduced-tuition
suggestion, saying it would result in unequal treatment on the
basis of race.
   In siding with the IRS, the Tax Court cited a 1983 case in which
the Supreme Court had stripped a tax exemption from Bob Jones
University after finding that it discriminated on the basis of race.
   The Supreme Court held that racially discriminatory schools
violate fundamental public policy and cannot be viewed as
conferring a benefit on the public.
   ``From the record before us,'' Nims wrote, ``it appears that
white students and their parents gravitate to petitioner (Calhoun)
at least in part because of a historical absence of black students:
Petitioner admits that the local public schools are superior in
material respects, yet considerably less expensive.
   ``Petitioner's survival would thus depend to some extent on
perpetuating its history,'' the court ruled, adding that such
discrimination would clearly preclude a federal tax exemption.

   There are no individual heroes in this account of a juicy slice of American history, not even Washington, Jefferson, Madison or Jackson. 
Its only hero is the American people, who are celebrated with ardor in rich and dense detail. 

   The merit of Oscar and Lilian Handlin's "Liberty in Expansion: 1760-1850" (Harper &amp; Row, 481 pages, $25.95) is that it treats the grand theme of freedom in American history by keeping it close to the earth of everyday living. 
The present book is the second of their planned four-volume history of "Liberty in America: 1600 to the Present," an ambitious project that bears witness to the American romance with freedom over the centuries. 

   The Handlins avoid grand theory and theorists. 
Liberty, they say, does not lie in concepts, thinkers or leaders, but in the experience of the people as they pursue the conditions of a good life. 
Out of this pursuit, liberty has emerged, almost as an afterthought. 

   The theme of migration, with its ethnicities and pluralisms, is the thread running through the lifelong work of the senior author, Oscar Handlin -- all the way from his early "Boston's Immigrants" (1941) and his Pulitzer-winning "The Uprooted" (1951). 
The present series fuses that theme with the story of liberty. 
I must add that no other major historian has aimed so persistently at a pointillism that turns the specific Whitmanesque points of light into a general picture of America. 

   The best way to read "Liberty in Expansion" is to start, perversely, with the 15-page epilogue in which the authors explain their method with a touch of belligerence. 
To study a "vast population . . . without obscuring their identities," they say, don't start with a "paradigm or model" of your own. 
Examine the "residues," "detritus" and "shards" left behind -- the tracts, pamphlets, newspapers, public records, letters, diaries, memoirs, advertisements, orations. 
After a time "contours" will appear, then "larger structures." 
Don't impose the patterns. 
Let the patterns emerge. 
Flee dualisms and dichotomies such as ideologies and class, consensus and conflict, frontier and imperialism, Hamilton and Jefferson, Republicans and Federalists, Democrats and Whigs, agrarian and mercantile. 
And don't lose yourself in a search for foreign sources of influence, whether John Locke or David Hume. 
The influences are likely to be home-grown, coming out of the American grain. 

   This is an appealing form of historical populism in its literal sense. 
The danger is that it can become a cult of the people, like Carl Sandburg's effusive "The People, Yes." 
Surely it asks too much of the "shards" of history, embedded in the mounds of raw evidence, to form their own pattern and to offer not only text and context for interpretation, but also the interpretation itself. 

   The result is a radical dissolvent of traditional history as narrative. 
There is no sequential account of the American Revolution here. 
The experience of the Revolution becomes a discipline in liberty and fortitude in the face of scarcities, confusions and suffering. 
We get no account of Washington and his generals but we get the pithy conclusion, from the evidence, that the Revolution "created something like a General Will." 

   The Constitution offers a similar test. 
Instead of seeing it as an act of creation by a remarkable group of framers, drawing on great 18th-century philosophers, the authors see only a group of "practical men" -- lawyers, merchants, planters -- moved by a fear of disorder in their daily lives, determined to create a structure of order. 
The resulting "social contract" was not only in the document and its judicial interpretations, but in the daily lives of nameless men. 

   This is the mood and method the authors apply as well to the first half of the new century. 
We get very little about Jackson, Clay, Calhoun and Webster -- the "Bigs" -- and much about the threat of disorder, the behavior of juries, and the treatment of two "enclaves" -- of the slaves and of Indians, who were pushed out of their forests and life ways by intolerance and treachery. 
We get the building of an infrastructure of toll roads, canals and railroads because they met the needs of the people. 
We get the greeds and cruelties, the tinkering, inventing and creating, the sectional compromises and the shadows that loomed beyond the compromises. 

   This is rich stuff. 
Yet I wish the Handlins -- so good at the interpretations that somehow emerge -- had given us more of them. 
They scorn the emphasis of historians on elites, but willy-nilly, their pages show plenty of talented and passionate Americans -- abolitionists, professional politicians, newspaper editors, preachers, feminists -- who keep pushing through the humdrum of life to wield a disproportionate influence on events. 
The vignettes they give us of extraordinary people -- Samuel Adams, Martin Van Buren, the black freeman Frederick Douglass, the preacher James F. Clarke, the Indian warrior Tecumseh -- are so sharp in their brevity as to warrant more expansive treatment. 

   In their anti-Carlylean rejection of the "Bigs," the authors fall into a dichotomy trap of their own, an either/or between the "people" and the creative individual shapers of American history, the Madisons and Emersons. 
This is one area in which they should have given us a both/and. 
It is in the dialogue between the people and their leaders that liberty is pursued and achieved. 
Like God, liberty is in the details.

   Two men join the Democratic presidential race this week.
One is Bill Clinton, a relatively obscure Arkansas governor
who is sometimes confused with DeWitt Clinton, the visionary
New York governor who built the Erie Canal. The other is Bob
Kerrey, a Nebraska senator who is so little known that
newspaper stories about him often are accompanied by pictures
of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
   The group of candidates -- which also includes Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and
Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia -- is no field of dreams. For
months, the Democrats' first team stood up, one by one, and
stood down from the race. Jay Rockefeller's not ready, Dick
Gephardt's not inclined, Al Gore's not willing, Lloyd
Bentsen's not disposed. The best that can be said for Mario
Cuomo, the Democrats' best shadowboxer, is that he's not
clear.

<TEXT>
   But candidate for candidate, the Democrats, who had the
presidency within reach four years ago, are fielding a more
interesting and in many ways stronger group of candidates in
1992 than they did in 1988.
   Take them by genre:
   -- The accomplished governor. Last season's entry, Michael
Dukakis, had three terms as governor and trumpeted his
success fashioning a Massachusetts Miracle. But that miracle,
which even then had the whiff of a mirage about it, was
fueled by the Reagan economic boom if not by the Reagan
defense buildup, and it occurred in a state with enormous
advantages that include, to start, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the Harvard Business School, big
banks, some of the nation's leading medical institutions,
scores of high-tech entrepreneurs and hundreds of thousands
of (over)educated workers.
   This year's veteran governor is Mr. Clinton, who, like Mr.
Dukakis, came back to dominate his state's politics after
voters rebelled against his first term. But the
accomplishments of Mr. Clinton, who has been cited as an
example by such Republicans as former Gov. Thomas Kean of New
Jersey and Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, are more
enduring.
   He's pressed for rural development and battled to win an
education overhaul that will be paying dividends to Arkansas
long after the public-private partnerships of Mr. Dukakis
have vanished. All of this in a state -- poor, crippled by
decades of segregation -- whose constitution shackles the
governor. Besides, Mr. Clinton, who actually likes
campaigning, is a far more natural politician than Mr.
Dukakis.
   -- The warrior lawmaker. The last Vietnam veteran to seek
the presidency was Al Gore, who had been in the Senate only
briefly before he entered the race. Serious and sober, he
mastered esoteric arguments about the dangers of
chlorofluorocarbons and the potential of fiber-optic
networks. He talked tough and sensibly on defense and came
close to breaking through.
   His analogue this time is Sen. Kerrey, whose Vietnam
experience is PT-109 without the hype, and more stirring than
Mr. Gore's experience as a reporter for the Army. He walked
on an artificial leg to pick up his Congressional Medal of
Honor, and is the first such honoree to sit in the Senate
since the Civil War veterans faded from politics. He matches
Mr. Gore's experience in Congress with a term as governor of
Nebraska, leaving office in a devoutly Republican state with
a 78% approval rating. He has the star quality the somewhat
stodgy Mr. Gore lacks; at a fund-raiser for his 1988 Senate
race, as many Nebraskans sought his autograph as Willie
Nelson's.
   -- The fiery populist. Rep. Gephardt swept the Iowa
caucuses four years ago with a populist theme that skirted
the very edge of protectionism, ending his speeches with an
explosive cry: "It's your fight, too." But that populism was
grafted onto Mr. Gephardt, who had built a reputation in
Washington as an insider with an eye toward accommodation.
   Sen. Harkin was born to poverty -- and populism.
Throughout his career he's relished the struggle against the
established and powerful. Unlike Mr. Gephardt, who has
strolled to re-election, Mr. Harkin has had real battles.
   --  The lonely man of ideas. Bruce Babbitt attracted a top
staff and a cult following in 1988 with some unusual
proposals: eliminate subsidies to large farmers, distribute
national child-care vouchers, curb tax breaks for executives'
bonuses.
   This time the idea man is Mr. Tsongas. While Mr. Babbitt
came to politics reluctantly, Mr. Tsongas grew up with it,
serving in local posts and the House before becoming a force
in the Senate, leaving only when faced with cancer. He
already is getting nods of agreement (though precious few
expressions of support) with a platform that offers an
"aggressively" pro-business approach, an end to requirements
that companies issue quarterly reports, a virgin materials
fee to give recycled commodities a price advantage, and an
Enterprise Corps of adults, modeled on the Peace Corps, to
help the Soviets.
   -- The voice of the voiceless. The last two campaigns, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson proved to be more than an eloquent voice
for the poor and disenfranchised. He emerged as a shrewd
strategist who knows how to set and then dominate the
political debate with rhetorical and moral fervor.
   But Gov. Wilder has done more than just talk about a
rainbow coalition. He's put one together, and done so in
Virginia, winning more than 40% of the white vote in a state
that a generation ago sought to revive the philosophy of John
C. Calhoun in a last-ditch effort of "massive resistance" to
desegregation. And while Mr. Jackson is often criticized for
supporting big-spending items, Mr. Wilder has positioned
himself as something of a fiscal conservative.
   Not that it will be easy to topple Mr. Bush next November.
The president's poll ratings are stratospheric and he's sure
to reignite the glow of the lightning victory in the Persian
Gulf. But there are vulnerable spots: the economy, the
continued rule of Saddam Hussein, a vague sense of unease
among the voters that things aren't quite right.
   But campaigns aren't always full of heavyweights. Few
political insiders considered Sen. John Kennedy anything but
a lightweight in 1959, and only later did Hubert Humphrey
attain his solid reputation. In 1975, the field of Jimmy
Carter, George Wallace, Mo Udall, Henry Jackson, Fred Harris
and Sargent Shriver wasn't noticeably stronger than this
group.
   And though this may not be the Democrats' starting five,
it is no old-timer's game either. Even with a 60-year-old
like Mr. Wilder in the group, it's a new generation of
candidates.
   Those strangers on the television set may be more suited
for the times than the familiar faces they're replacing.

LITTLE TEAMS OPEN FESTIVITIES IN 11TH BIG EAST TOURNAMENT

The Big East Conference tournament begins tonight at New York's Madison Square 
Garden with the elimination game between eighth-seeded Pittsburgh (11-16) and 
ninth-seeded Boston College (8-19), which scored only one conference victory 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to Friday's quarterfinal round and an appointment with No. 
1-seeded Syracuse (22-5), the nation's fourth-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for Friday: Connecticut (25-5), ranked eighth, vs. Seton Hall 
(12-15), which nearly won a national championship last season; Georgetown 
(22-5), ranked fifth, vs. Providence (17-10), and St. John's (23-8) vs. 
Villanova (17-13). 
</P>
<P>
The championship game will be played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
This tournament is usually a plaything for Syracuse and Georgetown. The 
Orangemen or Hoyas have won eight of the 10 postseason titles (Syracuse two, 
Georgetown six) and only one championship game was played without either team 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to pick a favorite, Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun chose Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think right now, the team that has been most devastating to us is 
Georgetown," he said. "Syracuse, when they crank it up, is strong. We're 
third." 
</P>
<P>
Just to be safe, Calhoun also didn't rule out Providence, because of a lineup 
that includes five seniors who played on a Final Four team, and St. John's, 
because of guard Boo Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
The point, he said, is that the Big East lends itself to upsets. Underrated 
Seton Hall was a last-second shot away from winning a national championship 
last year. This season, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
"The elevator in our league works very nicely," Calhoun said.

<HEAD>Haying Allowed In Set-Aside Land Because Of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has opened up land
set aside under a massive federal conservation program so that
farmers may harvest hay in areas were livestock feed has been
shriveled by drought and hot weather.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Thursday that all of
North Dakota and parts of a dozen other drought-stricken states are
eligible for haying on land held by farmers in the Conservation
Reserve Program, or CRP.
   ``Haying will be allowed for a 30-day period in counties found
to be suffering from a severe drought that has adversely affected
forage crops,'' Lyng said. ``Livestock grazing of this acreage is
not authorized.''
   In addition to the counties approved for haying, Lyng said that
additional designations will be made county-by-county by the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Once counties are approved, interested producers who are
enrolled in CRP will be notified and may apply at county offices
within 10 days for permission to cut hay from their land, he said.
   Jerry Newcomb, head of the agency's emergency operations and
livestock programs, said farmers in the counties announced on
Thursday can begin applying for the haying program as soon as
county offices receive operating procedures in the next day or so.
   Newcomb said he had no estimates of how many acres are eligible
for haying in the designated counties.
   The CRP, was authorized in the 1985 farm law to take up to 45
million acres of highly erodible land from crop production for 10
years. The land must be planted to protective grass or trees. In
return, farmers get annual rental payments from the government,
currently averaging $45 to $50 per acre a year.
   Farmers in feed-short drought areas have been seeking permission
to harvest hay from the CRP land and also to graze livestock on it.
Lyng, however, said grazing was not approved.
   Participants in the program who opt to cut hay from CRP land
will have their next annual payments reduced 25 percent on the
acreage harvested.
   Emergency haying and grazing had already been approved in more
than 1,000 counties in 20 states for land taken from crop
production under annual commodity programs. That land involves
so-called ``acreage conservation reserve'' and ``conservation use''
land and is not included in the long-term CRP operation.
   According to USDA's announcement, further county eligibility for
haying priviliges on CRP land ``will be made based on the fact that
the country has been approved for the emergency haying and
grazing'' of land in the acreage conservation reserve and the
conservation use categories.
   Further, the agency said, a ``drought severity index'' reported
weekly by USDA and the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration will be use to determine a county's
haying eligibility.
   In addition to all of North Dakota's 53 counties, the following
counties were designated for CRP haying privileges:

   The usually raucous ride to the mess
hall was quieter this noon as Sgt. Williams' words sank in.
   ``We don't have time for any attitudes,'' he told his men, all
neighbors from around Allendale, S.C. ``An attitude is going to get
people hurt when we're over there. We're on the same team and it's
time to act like a team.''
   The short lecture before lunch was just another sign that things
are getting serious for the 14 members of the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment.
   The water purification unit from the South Carolina National
Guard trained hard this past week for deployment to the Mideast.
But now the pace is even harder.
   The men go about the day's activities wearing gas mask packs and
web gear to get used to the weight. Their forest-patterned battle
dress fatigues have been exchanged for desert camouflage.
   Every early morning session of PT _ physical training _ sees
more miles run, a subject of mild grumbling among the unit, where
the average age is 35.
   ``If Saddam Hussein was chasing your ass across the desert you'd
all do another five miles,'' chided Capt. Robert Appiah, the
regular Army officer preparing the men for overseas.
   Every night goes a little later as the 265th commander, Sgt.
Ronnie Jackson, pushes his men to practice radio communications,
chemical protection and field operations.
   For Williams, the second in command, it is a question of
survival.
   Called John by his men and his superiors, the usually smiling
non-commissioned officer has been less cheerful these last few days.
   ``You realize what could happen and it makes you more serious,''
said the 42-year-old father of three.
   Williams, a computer programmer, is the only member of the unit
who experienced combat. He has shrapnel scars in his back to remind
him of the ambushes and firefights in Vietnam. They give him an
appreciation of training and teamwork.
   ``I could get knocked off or Ronnie could get knocked off, so
it's important that everybody learn to do every job,'' he said in
his soft voice. ``You've got to look at every man as the one who
might have to take over.''
   The push to get ready has had its casualties. For Spc. Henry
Harris, the 51-year-old retired teacher, it was sore knees. Sgt.
Bill Bostick, 42, has a bad back. Sgt. Earnest Deloach reinjured a
hamstring. All three were given light duty after being forced to
report to sick call.
   The three went reluctantly, fearing they might be sent home.
   ``There was no way I was going to go if that was the case,''
said the 38-year-old Deloach.
   After giving blood for an AIDS test, a requirement of all troops
facing deployment, Spc. Ulysses Calhoun stretched out on a couch
and suggested he might need a long rest. Someone asked if he would
like cookies and juice.
   ``No,'' said Calhoun, ``I believe a big T-bone and a 12-pack
will fix up my blood just right.''
   Still, for every light moment there is a reminder of the future.
After lunch the 265th joined hundreds of reservists for a general
briefing at the post's movie theater. When it ended the unit was
asked to stay for a briefing on Saudi Arabia.
   The reservists filed out, some stopping to wish the unit luck.
The 265th quickly found itself a lonely island of olive drab in a
sea of red chairs.
   ``Damn,'' said Spc. Willie Badger, looking around the empty
theater. ``All these people and we're the only ones going?''

<HEAD>A Look at American Pop Culture: `Edge' Goes Right Up To It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feeling a little alienated?
   Ever find yourself late at night wondering Just What Has Gone
Wrong With the Republic? Is the social contract up for renewal in
your neighborhood?
   And if Andrew Dice Clay did not exist, would it be necessary to
invent him?
   For the answer to the last question and more, tune in tonight to
PBS and ``Edge,'' a funny, adult and extremely well-written look at
American pop culture. It will show you things you otherwise
probably would never see.
   Vanity Fair writer James Wolcott tries to understand why people
laugh at the abusive humor of the '90s in the persona of Andrew
Dice Clay.
   Significantly, the segment is titled ``Another Day in Hell.''
   This is definitely for adults only. Not only does ``Edge''
liberally excerpt Clay's raunchy, unexpurgated concert routine, but
it discusses his appeal in terms of ``class hatred'' and
``marginalized'' white, working-class males.
   ``What's impressive about Clay is the emancipatory and
truth-telling impulse in him.'' says Frederic Smoler, a professor
of intellectual history at Sarah Lawrence College.
   ``The grimmest and saddest and thing about Clay is when he
strips away a thing, debunks it, what's left to his audiences' view
and his own is pretty small and ugly.''
   The least accessible segment is about the faceless photographs
of New York City conceptual artist Lorna Simpson. It's followed by
a nice ballad (inexplicably sung on a bare city rooftop) by
singer-songwriter John Hiatt.
   The great humorist Buck Henry comes on next with a visit to the
Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif. In opening his essay on the
fall and rise of the elder statesman, Henry notes that Yorba Linda
means ``beautiful yorba.''
   There is commentary by Professor Stanley Cutler, author of ``The
Wars of Watergate,'' who notes that the Nixon Library makes no
mention of Nixon's accepting a pardon for any Watergate crimes he
may have committed.
   ``Someday he'll be left alone to history,'' Cutler notes. He is
smiling.
   Henry notes Tom Brokaw's visit to Yorba Linda, to anchor the
evening news from the museum. And the Nixon birthplace, a kit-built
house that cost $800 from the factory and $400,000 to restore.
   There's such a nice, suppressed note of hysteria and loathing to
the piece. Far too soon, Henry bids a fond farewell to the Nixon
complex. He waves goodbye and drives away renewed, refreshed.
   The host of the series, Emmy Award winner Robert Krulwich,
reviews the recent history of student works at the Art Institute of
Chicago.
   Remember when one student painted Mayor Harold Washington in
brassiere, underpants, garter belt and stockings? The painting got
arrested.
   One year later, student ``Dread'' Scott Tyler's wretched ``How
to Display the Flag'' ignited the furor of veterans and flag-wavers
by displaying a flag on the floor that tacitly invited spectators
to walk on it.
   The beleaguered head of the institute school, Tony Jones, notes
that people who tired of abstract art and called for the return to
figurative art have gotten their wish _ with a vengeance.
   Then the show shows us four performance artists whose
applications for federal grants were rejected. It's a delightful
irony.
   And, with a wonderfully wry finale, the excellent comedian,
actor, writer and ``Simpsons'' voice Harry Shearer explains to us
just WHY anchormen are girdling the globe to cover the story.
Shearer is magnificently low-key.
   Make time to see this pilot episode, a joint production of New
York City's WNET and Britain's BBC-2. ``If successful, the pilot
will be followed by 10 one-hour programs,'' says WNET.
   Do yourself a favor and tune in.

   In "Some Summer Thoughts About Secession" (Global View,
op-ed, July 8), George Melloan very properly rejected any
analogy between the attempt of the Southern slave states to
secede from the American Union in 1861 and the current
attempts at secession from the Soviet Union and from
Yugoslavia. Mr. Melloan is entirely correct in asking,
"Should Americans allow Communists to say that seceding to
escape slavery is the same as seceding to preserve it?"
   While the underlying cause of secession was slavery, the
Southern argument was based upon what were called states'
rights. Each state, it was said, was sovereign, and possessed
the same constitutional right to withdraw from the Union that
it had originally to join it. Between 1787 and 1861 the
conception of states' rights -- in the South, but not only in
the South -- had, however, undergone a strange sea change. In
1787, as in 1776, all rights of the legitimate governments
were held to be grounded in the equal natural rights with
which every human individual had been endowed by his Creator.
States' rights -- or states' sovereignty, according to John
C. Calhoun, the spiritual father of the Confederacy -- had no
basis in natural law, but were entirely and exclusively
rights of positive law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was this severing of states' rights from natural rights
as much as the interest in slavery itself that drove the
movement for secession in 1861. But the divorce of states'
rights from natural rights not only removes any moral basis
for condemning slavery but places all constitutional rights
of individuals of every race or color at the mercy of the
state. It was not for nothing that the late Richard
Hofstadter called Calhoun "the Marx of the master class."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COACHES AND TEAMS MAKING THEIR MARKS THIS SEASON;

<P>
CALHOUN'S TEAM CONN.-FOUNDED ALL THE EXPERTS

</HEADLINE>

Jim Calhoun, his New England accent as thick as a bowl of clam chowder, never 
tires of telling how his Connecticut team defied logic and preseason 
predictions this year, to say nothing of a Big East schedule that includes such 
perennial basketball bullies as Syracuse and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun wants America to know that it didn't happen by accident, but by 
something as fickle and corny as teamwork. And OK, a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
It happened because Tate George, the only senior starter on the team, decided 
he wasn't going to go his entire career at Connecticut without appearing in at 
least one NCAA tournament. So during the off-season he shot 500 jumpers a day 
and later helped organize thrice-weekly workouts with his teammates that began 
at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It happened because sophomore Chris Smith, the one legitimate star on this 
team, nearly doubled his scoring average of a season ago. 
</P>
<P>
And it happened because Calhoun, who may have done the best coaching job of his 
career, also knew a thing or two about international relations, convincing 
Israel's basketball treasure, Nadav Henefeld, to venture from the Middle East 
to the Big East and, of course, to the campus at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're Cinderella," Calhoun said. "I think we maximize what we do 
well and hide what we don't. We have good components. The pieces fit together. 
We seem to have some answers to problems presented on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Or cawt, as Calhoun pronounces it. 
</P>
<P>
"Bet you couldn't tell I'm from Boston," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picked by conference coaches to finish eighth, Connecticut ended the regular 
season tied for first place with Syracuse, which probably still can't believe 
it has to share a Big East title with the Huskies. And when play begins 
Thursday in the conference tournament at New York's Madison Square Garden, 
Connecticut will be there sporting all sorts of impressive numbers, including a 
25-5 record, an 11-4 Big East mark, a No. 8 national ranking and the 
testimonial of one John Thompson, Georgetown coach and closet sentimentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the Hoyas' game against Connecticut at Capital Centre in 
Landover, Md., Thompson lumbered toward Calhoun. In a brief, heartfelt 
exchange, Thompson told the Connecticut coach how much he had admired the work 
done with the Huskies this season. Then, despite beating Connecticut by 20 
points that evening, Thompson delivered a postgame sermon to the media that 
once again praised Calhoun and the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his team, in all the years I've been in the Big East, is the biggest 
surprise to me," Thompson said. "People like to run around and talk about 
surprises, but I think Calhoun has done as good a job as I've ever seen in the 
Big East -- consistently at the level he's done it at. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, everybody talked about Seton Hall being a surprise (advancing to 
the final of the NCAA tournament). I thought Seton Hall was going to be a very 
good team, and everybody misread them. I did not think Connecticut would be as 
good as they are this year. The man has done one hell of a job with that team, 
regardless of what happens from here on in." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson spoke the truth. No team in the 11-year history of the Big East has 
been picked eighth in the preseason poll and finished first. No team in the 
conference ever finished seventh one season, as the Huskies did in 1988-89, and 
went on to win or share a title the next season. In fact, no seventh-place Big 
East team had ever done better than fifth the following season until 
Connecticut arrived and changed the shape of the bell curve. 
</P>
<P>
If Calhoun is upset about the preseason snub by his peers, he doesn't show it. 
If anything, he agreed with their choices. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were picked eighth because seventh and ninth were occupied," he 
said. "It was probably a very justifiable pick." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the reasons: Cliff Robinson, the Huskies' 6-foot-11 scoring machine, 
had joined the NBA. Connecticut's leading three-point shooter was gone, too. 
Worse yet, the returning team featured no double-figure scorer and only one 
senior starter. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had a lot of guys coming back, too," George said. "People don't know 
how hard you work during the summer. They just see how you ended the season." 
</P>
<P>
For Connecticut, last season ended in the NIT, rather than in the NCAA 
tournament. An earlier two-point loss to Providence and a three-point loss to 
Seton Hall had sealed the Huskies' fate with the NCAA selection committee. 
Providence was the final Big East entry, thus extending Connecticut's record as 
being the only team in the conference's history never to appear in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after this 18-13 disappointment that George started pumping 500 
shots a day. Smith went to the Olympic Festival in Oklahoma City to improve his 
game. And Calhoun flew to Tel Aviv, in hopes of signing the 6-7 1/2 Henefeld, a 
low-post player on the Israeli national team whose soft touch and court skills 
were more suited to off-guard or small forward in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld, who had visited the Connecticut campus for only four hours during a 
previous recruiting trip, eventually accepted a scholarship from the Huskies. 
But he couldn't practice with the team until his Scholastic Aptitude Test 
results were received and approved by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld took the test on Oct. 14. Connecticut began practice on Oct. 15. At 
3:30 p.m. on Nov. 1, Henefeld was granted permission to join the team. Later 
that night, after a brief orientation drill, Calhoun inserted Henefeld into the 
lineup against Marathon Oil, a traveling exhibition team. Afterward, Henefeld 
was asked about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very interesting, to play before you practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld improved. He finished this season averaging 12.0 points and 5.9 
rebounds a game. He also recorded 120 steals, a total surpassed by only one 
other Division I player this season. Thus the nickname: "Gaza Strips." His 
teammates, though, unsure how to pronounce his first name (it's NAH-dove), 
started calling him, "the Dove." It stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are a half-dozen interview requests for Henefeld each day -- and not 
just from the American media. As perhaps Israel's leading sports celebrity, 
Henefeld is being followed closely in that country. That would explain why at 
least one Israeli television crew will be on press row when Connecticut plays 
Seton Hall Friday at noon in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the Huskies are used to attention, however far-flung it might be. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine newspaper, radio and television reporters followed Connecticut to 
Boston College last week. Against Georgetown, four local stations reported live 
from the game. Ten newspapers accompanied the Huskies to the Great Alaska 
Shootout in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Connecticut officials fondly refer to the area media as "The 
Horde." 
</P>
<P>
"People in other parts of the country might not comprehend that," said Tim 
Tolokan, Connecticut's sports information director. "But we're the No. 1 sports 
story in this state." 
</P>
<P>
Some story. The Huskies began their Big East schedule by losing their first two 
games. Then they proceeded to win 12 of their next 14 conference games. By 
season's end, Connecticut had beaten every Big East team at least once, 
including St. John's, which had drubbed the Huskies by 31 points earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost to St. John's as bad as we did, a lot of teams would have had a 
couple days off, figuring they needed time to forget about it," George said. 
"We had our regular 2 1/2-hour practice. It was like we didn't even play the 
night before." 
</P>
<P>
Said Calhoun: "We have a tremendous sense of chemistry and we're unaffected by 
outside pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but they're also eighth in the conference in field-goal percentage, 
seventh in free-throw percentage, seventh in three-point percentage and sixth 
in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the No. 8 team in the country? 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut survives despite such numbers because it averages about 17 more 
scoring opportunities a game than its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know the saying," Calhoun said, " 'Even a blind squirrel can find an 
acorn once in a while.' " 
</P>
<P>
Already there are rumors that Calhoun might be wooed away by a high-profile 
program in need of a good coach and some integrity -- did someone say North 
Carolina State? This is Calhoun's fourth year at Connecticut and he has taken 
the Huskies from a 9-19 record in 1986-87, the year he had to start a walk-on 
from the baseball team, to an NIT championship the next season, to a 25-5 
record and a soon-to-be-issued NCAA tournament bid in 1990. And at Thursday's 
news conference in New York, Calhoun is expected to receive the Big East's 
coach-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
But will he stay put? 
</P>
<P>
So popular is Calhoun in Connecticut that he said he can't visit a restaurant 
and eat a meal without interruption from well-meaning fans. He has become a 
state hero, and with such stature comes a price, mainly his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single year, what I try to do is sit down and evaluate myself and my 
situation," he said. "Connecticut is a terrific job. I'm not sure the vision 
was 25-5, though. The vision was to make us a mainstream Big East team." 
</P>
<P>
That accomplished, Calhoun carefully fends off talk of his possible departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy here," he said. "I don't have plans to leave here. But I want to 
make sure I feel very comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
A Big East tournament championship would help. So would a strong showing in the 
NCAA tournament, which is what George has in mind. After all, he didn't shoot 
those off-season jumpers for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside the league, they respect us because we come out every night and play 
hard," George said. "But outside the league, people think we're still the new 
team on the block. Hopefully, we'll raise some hell in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
As if they haven't done enough already.

<HEAD>Love-Triangle Murder, Grant's Menagerie: Lafayette Square Saw it
All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists admiring the grassy serenity of
Lafayette Square little suspect that it once was the site of a
love-triangle murder, Helen Hayes' stage debut and a makeshift zoo
where Ulysses S. Grant kept a menagerie of deer and prairie dogs.
   Some of the ``secrets of Lafayette Square,'' both amusing and
tragic, were disclosed Wednesday during a historical tour of the
seven-acre park opposite the White House. The tour was sponsored by
the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
   According to tour guide Sarah Shaffer, the square that is
inhabited today by homeless vagrants and anti-nuclear demonstrators
once was surrounded by elegant hotels and clubs and the homes of
prominent Washington figures.
   The square is no stranger to scandal. More than a century before
the Watergate scandal engulfed the Nixon White House, a lurid sex
scandal resulted in the death of the son of Francis Scott Key, who
wrote ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   Phillip Barton Key was fond of crossing the square from his
boarding house to visit the wife of Daniel Sickles, a New York
congressman, when she waved an all-clear signal from her bedroom
window. Sickles, enraged at the discovery of his wife's infidelity,
killed Key with a shotgun blast in 1859.
   On the east side of the square lived Dolley Madison, the
destitute widow of James Madison, who had to mortgage her house
before Henry Clay persuaded Congress to give her $20,000 to pay off
her debt to John Jacob Astor.
   Nearby is the site of the old Belasco Theater, a vaudeville
palace where actress Helen Hayes made her first stage appearance as
a 5-year-old singer.
   On the northeastern edge of the square, where the Department of
Veterans Affairs has its headquarters, stood the posh Arlington
Hotel, where industrialist Andrew Carnegie once spent $10,000 on a
dinner party for his friends.
   The park originally contained a private farmhouse, apple orchard
and graveyard before it was bought in 1791 to help create the
capital city envisioned by George Washington.
   It served as the unkempt front lawn of the executive mansion for
a while, until Thomas Jefferson ordered Pennsylvania Avenue built
right through the middle. It was a military campground in the War
of 1812 and again during the Civil War, when President Lincoln
crossed the street to visit troops guarding the White House.
   The President's Park was renamed Lafayette Square during the
French military hero's visit to the United States in 1824. But it
is Andrew Jackson _ not Lafayette _ who is honored with an
equestrian statue in the center of the park.
   The statue was cast at a local foundry from melted-down British
cannons seized in the War of 1812. It was unveiled in 1853 and
celebrated by spectators who toasted ``Old Hickory'' from open kegs
of rum and whiskey.
   The square was haunted by tragedy, too.
   Conspirators in Lincoln's assassination in 1865 bungled an
attempt to kill Secretary of State William Seward in his home on
Lafayette Square. Although Seward survived, his wife and daughter
died of ``nervous prostration'' shortly after the attack.
   In a home on the present site of the Hay-Adams Hotel on the
northern edge of the square, Clover Adams, daughter-in-law of John
Quincy Adams, committed suicide by drinking chemicals from her
rooftop photography lab.
   Long before the square was beautified with fountains and floral
gardens, President Grant had the park drained and landscaped,
removed a Civil War cemetery and installed his pet deer and prairie
dogs.
   Grant's zoo was closed when the neighbors complained of the
noise and stench.
   The tour was part of local observances of National Historic
Preservation Week, an annual event sponsored by the non-profit
National Trust to encourage public support of efforts to preserve
buildings, objects and sites of historic significance.

<TEXT>
   President John F. Kennedy, Harvard class
of 1940, couldn't resist some good-natured teasing when Yale
awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1962.
   ``As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledged America to be
the daughter of Europe, so I am pleased to come to Yale, the
daughter of Harvard,'' Kennedy told graduates assembled in the
courtyard of Yale's Old Campus on that sunny June day.
   ``It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds _ a
Harvard education and a Yale degree,'' Kennedy said.
   This year's presidential campaign has elevated what is perhaps
the oldest, most intense and most snobbish rivalry in America to a
new height.
   For the spoils of this contest will go either to a Yale man or a
Harvard man _ only the second time in 200 years that graduates of
the two schools have vied for the presidency of the United States.
   And the only other time it happened, in 1912, the Harvard man,
Theodore Roosevelt, and the Yale man, William Howard Taft, both
lost to a Princeton man, Woodrow Wilson.
   While Kennedy was a master at exploiting his Harvard education
for political advantage, Republican George Bush, Yale class of
1948, has tried to turn Democrat Michael S. Dukakis' Harvard
connections into a campaign liability.
   Bush, scion of a wealthy Greenwich, Conn., family, accuses the
Massachusetts governor, the son of Greek immigrants, of having a
``Harvard boutique'' mentality tainted by ``liberalism and
elitism.''
   Campaigning Saturday in Modesto, Calif., Bush said, ``I don't
want somebody from Harvard telling me what I can do and what I
can't do.''
   Asked about that statement at a news conference Sunday, Bush
said he did not want to take on the institution itself, asking
``How can I, a nice guy from Yale, feel that way about Harvard? Now
come on.
   ``I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in
(recent) Democratic administrations that come out of the same
liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said.
``There's an elite inside the elite there.''
   Dukakis, in turn, has tried to stay out of the Harvard-Yale
debate, saying his 1960 Harvard law degree and teaching stint at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government don't make him a Harvard man
at all.
   ``I'm a Swarthmore guy,'' Dukakis says, referring to the liberal
arts college in Pennsylvania where he received his undergraduate
degree.
   But Bush's Harvard line held little sting given his own Ivy
League connections. And it probably was lost on most Americans, who
view both Yale and Harvard as elite Eastern universities for the
wealthy.
   Dukakis campaign aides couldn't hold their tongues when outgoing
Education Secretary William Bennett, himself a Harvard Law School
graduate, asserted on national television in September that the
Harvard crowd ``with which Mike Dukakis runs ... think they're
smarter'' than most Americans.
   ``Bill Bennett spent seven or eight years getting an education
in Massachussetts and these comments are a clear indication that it
didn't do him a bit of good,'' shot back Mark Gearan, press
secretary at Dukakis' Boston headquarters.
   Harvard and Yale have eyed each other with haughty disdain for
nearly 300 years, since Yale was founded in 1701 by a group of
clergy worried about religious backsliding at the more liberal
Harvard, the oldest college in America. Harvard was founded in
1636, just 16 years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.
   ``We have been natural rivals almost from the beginning,''
George Pierson, the Larned professor emeritus of history at Yale,
said recently. ``We were the only two with the exception of William
and Mary that you could go to. After that, we both grew in the
favor of the Lord.''
   The Harvard-Yale annual crew race is the oldest intercollegiate
sports rivalry in America, dating from 1852. The schools refer to
their annual football contest as ``The Game,'' as if all others
hardly matter.
   Other Harvard-Yale presidential campaigns have been averted only
by quirks of history. The 1824 election would have pitted Harvard
graduate John Quincy Adams against Yale graduate John Calhoun, but
Calhoun dropped out and threw his support to Adams, who defeated
Andrew Jackson, who didn't have a college degree.
   The 1876 contest between Rutherford B. Hayes, a graduate of
Harvard Law School, against Samuel Tilden would have been a
Harvard-Yale matchup, except Tilden dropped out of Yale after one
year and graduated from New York University.
   Although this is only the second head-to-head match, Harvard and
Yale both boast presidents among their graduates. While Yale holds
the edge in their football series, 56-40, and Harvard holds the
edge in crew races, 72-51, Harvard holds a substantial lead in the
presidential sweepstakes: six Harvard graduates have held the
office _ John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Hayes, Theodore Roosevelt,
Franklin Roosevelt and Kennedy _ compared to just two from Yale _
Taft and Gerald Ford, a 1941 graduate of Yale Law School.
   Raymond Wolfinger, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, says most Americans don't give a hoot about
the Harvard-Yale rivalry.
   ``In terms of the mass public, the difference between Harvard
and Yale is nonsense,'' said Wolfinger, who earned his doctorate at
Yale.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Echoes of a Speakers' Scandal Followed Blaine for
Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the morning of June 5, 1876, James G.
Blaine, the speaker of the House of Representatives, stood in the
well of the House and waved a packet of letters in the air.
   Blaine, one of the nation's foremost politicians, was in serious
trouble.
   And he was about to confound his accusers.
   Nearly 113 years later another speaker of the House _ Jim Wright
of Texas _ faces accusations of unethical behavior in office.
   Wright adamantly denies any wrongdoing. But he has been the
subject of the most prolonged and intense of the several
investigations conducted over the decades into the private and
public affairs of a speaker of the House.
   Speaker Blaine rode out his scandal, but echoes of it were to
follow him for the rest of his career.
   In the spring of 1876, Blaine was a frontrunner for the
Republican presidential nomination in the election that would
replace President Ulysses S. Grant's corruption-ridden
administration.
   Three years earlier Reps. Oakes Ames, R-Mass., and James Brooks,
D-Mass., had been censured by the House for involvement in the
so-called Credit Mobilier scandal in which railroad construction
stock had been given to selected members of Congress, allegedly for
favors received.
   Now Blaine became embroiled in the scandal, facing accusations
that the Union Pacific Railroad had paid the speaker an inflated
price for stock of a defunct and bankrupt rail line.
   An investigation was launched by the House Judiciary Committee
but it was sputtering when new evidence emerged.
   It took the form of a set of letters between Blaine and a
business partner which had come into the possession of a third man,
James Mulligan.
   Mulligan, in Washington to testify before the committee,
encountered an unexpected visitor at his hotel _ Speaker James G.
Blaine.
   According to Mulligan, an emotional session followed in which
Blaine fell to his hands and knees and begged for the letters,
threatening suicide if he did not receive them.
   Mulligan claimed Blaine obtained the letters by a pretext and
left the hotel.
   An uproar followed and Blaine came under intense pressure to
make the Mulligan letters public. He refused, claiming they were
private property.
   Instead, he obtained a statement from two lawyers who said they
had examined the letters and found nothing relevant to the
investigation.
   The uproar continued and Blaine set about to defuse it.
   On June 5 he appeared on the House floor and waved the packet
exclaiming, ``There they are. ... There are the original letters.''
   Blaine then read aloud what he said were the contents of each of
the letters. He said he had handed over ``every solitary scrap and
scrimption'' for inclusion in the Congressional Record.
   They had, he declared, ``no more to do with that investigation
than the North Pole.''
   But no one was ever shown the originals of the letters to verify
Blaine's reading of them.
   Events moved rapidly.
   Blaine collapsed outside his church suffering from a possible
heat stroke. The investigation was postponed for two weeks to await
his recovery. But before the committee could reconvene, the
governor of Maine appointed Blaine to fill a vacancy in the Senate.
   The investigation was postponed again, and eventually died.
   Blaine's political backers proceeded, in classical Washington
fashion, to make the best of a bad situation.
   In the 20th century it's called making lemonade out of a lemon.
   Blaine's name was placed in nomination at the Republican
National Convention by Robert G. Ingersoll on June 15, 1876, with
words that gave Blaine an enduring nickname: ``The plumed knight
from the state of Maine.''
   ``Like an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine
marched down the halls of the American Congress and threw his
shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every
traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputation.''
   Blaine never obtained the presidency.
   But he twice was appointed secretary of state.
   No House speaker has ever been ousted. But several have been
singed during the 200-year history of Congress.
   Henry Clay, who was elected speaker six times, drew accusations
of ``corrupt bargain'' when the close election of 1824 was thrown
into the House of Representatives.
   The choice was between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.
Clay and other members of the Kentucky delegation tipped the
balance in favor of Adams.
   The accusations flew after the victorious Adams named Clay as
his secretary of state.
   Speaker Samuel J. Randall, a Pennsylvania Democrat, promptly
called for his own investigation in 1879 after being accused of
favoritism toward a company which provided the paper for the bonds
and banknotes produced by the Bureau of Engraving.
   He was quickly cleared.
   In 1910 Speaker Joseph G. Cannon faced a rebellion against his
imperious and heavy handed rule of the House.
   Although not deposed, Cannon was stripped of much of his power.
   Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, D-Mass., was named in the
so-called ``Koreagate'' influence peddling scandal in the 1970's
but was exonerated.

   After two weeks of hard training comes
the hardest day.
   ``It's all right, hon. It's going to be fine,'' Sgt. Earnest
Deloach said over and over as his wife, Lillie, sobbed into his big
chest. ``It's okay.''
   The 265th Quartermaster Detachment was leaving for the Mideast.
   Ima Jean Rooker went to hug her son, Spc. Mark Rooker, a big,
strapping boy of 20 whose desert camouflage uniform was hung with
canteens, chemical warfare gear and his M-16.
   Her smile dissolved into tears as she reached out for her
youngest. ``Ooh,'' was all she managed to say.
   Rooker's father, Jerry, stood to the side, reaching in around
his sunglasses to rub his eyes.
   Nineteen days ago, Rooker was a college student, Deloach was a
prison supervisor and the rest of the 14-man unit of the South
Carolina National Guard worked jobs from truck driving to
construction.
   But military planners determined they needed water purification
specialists in Saudi Arabia and the Allendale, S.C., unit showed up
on someone's list.
   The unit was mobilized and rushed through a busy training
schedule of physical conditioning, marksmanship, chemical warfare
and radio communications.
   Now, it was time for goodbyes.
   ``It reminds me of your GI Joe days,'' Mrs. Rooker said to her
son, her voice choking.
   ``I'll be home before you know it,'' Rooker said. There was an
uncomfortable silence.
   Suddenly, Spc. Ulysses Calhoun began to sing. ``Sometimes I feel
like a nut, sometimes I don't ... ''
   Everyone laughed and the tension was broken.
   Calhoun, a 23-year-old construction worker, was usually the one
to complain about the duty or the weather or the food. Today he was
light and breezy, joking with everyone and playing with his
daughter, Whitney, a fearless 3-year-old who marched around with a
U.S. flag in her hand, her father's desert-issue sunglasses propped
on her face.
   ``Daddy, why you always wearing the same clothes,'' she asked,
pointing to his uniform.
   Whitney had seen her father on local television a number of
times, but Calhoun was unimpressed with his celebrity.
   ``I'd rather I was on a game show,'' he said.
   The goodbyes lingered through most of the day. The unit traveled
to Hunter Army Air Field in a tight little convoy of four pickup
trucks and one van. The families followed in their cars, headlights
on like a funeral procession.
   No one talked in the crowded van. ``Why y'all so quiet,'' Sgt.
John Williams asked. ``How about some music?''
   No one noticed the rap music booming out of the radio. Mostly
they napped or stared out the window at signs and yellow ribbons
wishing godspeed to troops already departed for Saudi Arabia.
   The 265th's immediate destination was a large, open airplane
hangar half-filled with cots, a color television, bleachers, video
arcade games, portable latrines and magazines in Eastern Airline
folders. Creedence Clearwater Revival and Pink Floyd echoed from a
loudspeaker in the rafter.
   This was ``lockup,'' a holding area for men and material
shipping out to the Mideast. Once in, the men couldn't leave. Their
families weren't allowed near the area.
   So the families gathered in bleachers set 1,000 yards away to
watch their husbands and sons load duffel bags and flak jackets
onto one of their trucks.
   A while later the families sent over packages of fried chicken
and had their own picnic as the men ate in the sweltering heat of
the runway.
   But finally, it was time for the families to go. They shouted
and waved as the men rushed out to wave back.
   ``Goodbye, goodbye,'' they called, their voices high and thin in
the distance.

   Joseph A. Bevilacqua, whose lifelong
friendships with reputed mobsters tarnished and eventually ended his
career as Rhode Island's top legislator and top judge, died
Wednesday. He was 70.
   Bevilacqua was elected to the Rhode Island House in 1954 and
maintained a successful criminal law practice while he rose through
the ranks to become majority leader in 1966 and speaker in 1969.
   Questions about his ties to criminals came into the open when the
General Assembly elected him chief justice of the state Supreme
Court in 1976. Investigations were conducted, and in 1985 Bevilacqua
was censured by the Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline for
associating with known criminals. In 1986, after the General
Assembly launched impeachment proceedings, Bevilacqua resigned.

   Two-time Olympic gold medalist Lee Calhoun, who
won the 110-meter hurdles with dramatic victories in Melbourne and
Rome, died Wednesday of complications related to a stroke. He was 56.
   Calhoun was the head track and field coach at Western Illinois
University since 1980.
   He was the first man to win successive Olympic hurdle titles. His
first came in the 110-meter hurdles at the 1956 Games at Melbourne,
when as a virtual unknown he slipped past heavily favored teammate
Jack Davis in a photo finish and his time of 13.5 seconds
established an Olympic record.
   Four years later at Rome, Calhoun again needed a photo finish to
nip teammate Willie May by one one-hundreth of a second for his
second gold medal.
   The Laurel, Miss. native was a seven-time national champion and
also held world records in the 110-, 50-, 60- and 70-meter hurdles.

   Gore Vidal's novelistic march through U.S. history here reaches the years 1895-1906 and the presidencies of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. 
It wasn't our nation's finest hour and this novel isn't Mr. Vidal's. 

   Perhaps the problem is that the novel lacks a towering central character. 
After reinventing Aaron Burr for an age that remembered him, if at all, only as one of history's bad guys, and humanizing Abraham Lincoln who had been so wrapped in glory by Carl Sandburg's interminable, adoring biography in earlier historical novels, Mr. Vidal is working with lesser figures here in his fifth fictional treatment of American history. 

   Geniuses come and go on the periphery -- Henry Adams, Brooks Adams, Henry James -- but the novel centers on a fictional woman, Caroline Sanford, who becomes a powerful Washington newspaper publisher, and John Hay, once secretary to Lincoln, now secretary of state for McKinley and Roosevelt. 

   In Hay, a wealthy, famous writer turned statesman, Mr. Vidal, a famous writer but only a would-be statesman, has a sort of mirror image of himself. 
And "Empire" (Random House, 486 pages, $22.50) is a forum for Vidalian jibes -- many of them delivered by Hay -- at the follies of U.S. politicians and the corruption of U.S. society. 
A major part of a secretary of state's job is defined as "to provide jobs that don't exist for the friends of senators who do." 
Caroline Sanford, rich, intelligent, French-educated and virginal, decides early on: "Sentimental religiosity and public stealing, that was the new world." 
Another character, disparaging Roosevelt, wonders: "Perhaps that was the politician's art: to bring to the obvious the appearance of novelty and passion." 

   When "Empire" begins, Hay is 60 years old and in failing health. 
Mr. Vidal, now 61, presents him as an autumnal voice seeking meaning in his own life and brooding upon mankind's follies. 
Early on Hay muses: "If I were to tell the truth I would have to confess that I have somehow managed to mislay my life. 
Through carelessness, I have lost track of time and now time is losing, rapidly, all track of me." 

   Hay also is the main voice for Mr. Vidal's opposition to the creation of an American empire, the cherished goal of Roosevelt, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge and others who glory in the taking of Cuba and the Philippines from Spain. 
Jingoism rides high. 
"Asia is ours," says Lodge. 
Brooks Adams, guru to Roosevelt, proclaims: "If the Anglo-Saxon race is to survive -- and prevail -- we must go to war." 

   It's a debate as familiar as Nicaragua today or Vietnam 20 years ago. 
Equally fresh are some of the novel's discussions of sex and public life. 
Like Caroline Sanford, Gary Hart might ask whether "Americans really believe what they said {on sexual relations} or were . . . simply fearful of that ominous majority whose ignorance and energy set the national tone? 
They certainly never ceased to pretend in public that marriage was not only sacred but the stately terminus to romance." 

   But while Mr. Vidal makes much of his characters' thoughts and conversations, "Empire" is a curiously plotless book, almost totally lacking drama. 
Even in the fictional lives of Caroline and her brother Blaise what might be a bitter or damaging contest over their inheritance ends up with their amicably sharing the family mansion in France and their Washington newspaper. 

   Adultery, a homosexual seduction, a potentially career-destroying unmarried pregnancy, some family skeletons dragged from the closet, all get thrown into the mix, but Mr. Vidal doesn't seem to care. 
At times he doesn't seem to care about what he's saying either. 
It's hard to believe that Mr. Vidal, the antithesis of sophomoric, could write, as he does after the tragic death of Caroline's young fiance: "As Caroline comforted her maid, Blaise knew that she would be all right. 
On the other hand, he wondered, briefly, about the universe. 
Was it all right? or was the whole thing meaningless and random, and insensately cruel?" 

   He has a better time making fun of the idle rich at Newport. 
Or mocking the press. 
Or playing with mirrors of fact and fiction as when his heroine, seeking advice from Henry Adams, likens herself to Mrs. Lightfoot Lee, the heroine of Adams's wonderful Washington novel "Democracy." 

   But there's far too little of Mr. Vidal having such fun in "Empire." 
The way publishing operates, however, what's between the yellow covers of "Empire" doesn't matter. 
It's already an assured best seller, published with a giant first printing of 200,000 copies and as a Book-of-the-Month-Club main selection. 
And why not? 
After 21 novels, five plays, a book of short stories and five collections of essays in a distinguished 41-year career, when Mr. Vidal writes a novel it ought to be a center-ring event. 

   But is all history center-ring material? 
Is everything grist for the historical novelists' mills? 
At the rate those mills are grinding now, there will be a place in fiction for everyone from every administration. 
I wonder what future readers will make of Billy Carter. 
Or of Albert Hakim.

Like most basketball players, Rod Sellers probably dreamed of being on the 
floor with a championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
In Sellers' case, however, the dream has become a little twisted. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, the University of Connecticut's sophomore center, has wrenched his 
left knee three times in the past seven games. Each time, he has wound up on 
the floor, squirming with pain. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the deck again in UConn's second-round NCAA Tournament victory over UC 
Berkeley on Saturday. "It's getting frustrating, ending up on the floor every 
game," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't practice Monday, Sellers pronounced himself well enough to 
play against Clemson on Thursday in the NCAA East Regional semifinals at 
Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. The winner of that game will face 
the winner of the UCLA-Duke game for a berth in the Final Four in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said he would practice today -- "All out," he said -- and is looking 
forward to tangling with Clemson's 6-foot-11 front-court stars, Elden Campbell 
and Dale Davis, known as the "Duo of Doom." 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt I'm playing," said Sellers, who has a partial tear of the medial 
collateral ligament. "There was less pain this time. It's a little stiff and I 
can't bend it all the way back, but I can run (and move laterally). . . . It's 
nothing serious, it just needs some rest." 
</P>
<P>
UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said Sellers could have re-entered the game against UC 
Berkeley, which the Huskies won by 20 points, but it was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was this Thursday and the same thing happened, he probably would play," 
Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
That suits Sellers fine. He is from Florence, S.C., and grew up watching the 
Tigers on television. In fact, Clemson was high on Sellers' list when he was 
choosing a college. 
</P>
<P>
When Sellers visited Clemson, Campbell and 6-7 forward Sean Tyson showed him 
around. "I know those guys pretty well," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had 26 points and 17 of Clemson's 55 rebounds in the Tigers' 79-75 
victory over LaSalle on Saturday at the Civic Center. Tyson had 17 points and 
11 rebounds and Campbell, who fouled out, had seven points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first put the (NCAA Tournament) brackets up I said, 'We're going to 
meet them sometime,' " Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, who averages 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds, is wearing his third knee 
brace. He has used a white one and, for the sake of poetic justice, a black one 
and a blue one. He wants to get a darker blue brace to match his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had so many braces, I want to get one in every color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Williams, UConn's junior forward, also will wear a knee brace Thursday, 
although it's not nearly as high-tech as Sellers'. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has a history of knee problems, had fluid drained from his right 
knee Monday and should be ready for the Clemson game. "There's been more and 
more swelling as he's taken some pounding down the stretch," Calhoun said. "He 
says it's going to be much better than it has in two weeks. You could see in 
the last couple of games, I thought, that he wasn't quite as quick as he has 
been." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (30-5) began preparing for Clemson (26-8) Monday with rebounding 
and general toughening-up drills. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun will begin tailoring specific offenses and defenses this afternoon. 
After practice, the team leaves for New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"You always try to attack big people (like Xavier did in beating Georgetown on 
Sunday)," Calhoun said. "We'll spread it out and attack, but we'll still 
attack."

   L. Douglas Wilder's apparent victory in the Virginia governor's
race is a watershed in American political history, in which black
politicians have had but a shadowy presence.
   Wilder would be the nation's first elected black governor, but
would not be the first black American to serve as governor.
   That distinction belongs to Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback,
who became governor of Louisiana following the impeachment of Henry
Clay Warmoth in 1872. He served for 43 days until the newly elected
William Pitt Kellogg was sworn in.
   Although any number of candidates could have been drawn from the
small, black middle class that had existed in the nation since its
founding, a black was not elected to office until 1855, when John
Mercer Langston was elected clerk of Brownhelm Township in Lorain
County, Ohio.
   The first blacks ever elected to a legislative body were Edward
G. Walker, son of abolitionist David Walker, and Charles L.
Mitchell, who won seats in the Massachusetts House of
Representatives in 1866.
   Most of the nation's first black elected officials won their
positions during Reconstruction _ the post-Civil War period in
which Southern states were reorganized so they could rejoin the
Union. Blacks were allowed to vote for the first time and seek
elected office.
   It was a time when Robert H. Wood became mayor of Natchez,
Miss., and Joseph H. Rainey of South Carolina became the first
black in the House of Representatives.
   Hiram R. Revels, a minister, succeeded Jefferson Davis as U.S.
senator from Mississippi on Feb. 25, 1870, thus becoming first
black in Congress. But Blanche K. Bruce, also from Mississippi, was
the first black to serve a full term in the Senate.
   Pinchback, the son of a Mississippi planter and a black woman,
had been a captain in the Union Army. Following the Civil War, he
settled in Louisiana and joined the Republican Party, which largely
consisted of newly franchised blacks and sympathetic and liberal
whites.
   A shrewd and ambitious man, he was elected to the state Senate
in 1868 and was named president pro tempore. When Oscar J. Dunn, a
former slave and the nation's first black lieutenant governor,
died, Pinchback moved to the No. 2 spot through constitutional
succession.
   There were other black lieutenant governors during
Reconstruction in Mississippi and South Carolina. But none was ever
elected governor.
   Wilder, too, served as a lieutenant governor in a Southern
state. But in Virigina at the end of the 20th century, he is part
of the political mainstream.
   Pinchback was something of a pariah. Even as an elected
official, he and his family faced racism. His children had to be
escorted to high school to protect them from mobs of bigoted white
youths. And because of his elegance, intelligence and ambition,
white politicians considered him dangerous.
   His attempt to run for governor was thwarted because whites
controlled the election machinery and blacks were divided. He
instead ran for the U.S. House of Representatives and was elected.
He also ran for the U.S. Senate and was elected in 1873. But after
three years of debate, the Senate refused to seat him.
   ``I demand simple justice,'' Pinchback told the Senate. ``I do
not care so far as I am personally concerned whether you give me my
seat or not. I will go back to my people and come here again; but I
tell you to preserve your own consistency. Do not make fish of me
while you make flesh of everybody else.''
   Pinchback's case drew attention from the national press. Said
the New York Commercial Advertiser: ``Pinchback's presence in the
U.S. Senate is not open to the smallest objection, except the old
Bourbon war-whoops of color.
   ``Mr. Pinchback is the best dressed Southern man we have had in
Congress from the South since the days when gentlemen were
Democrats.''

   Calhoun and Badger are
on guard duty, a fact neither is happy about.
   They must check all vehicles coming into this dusty post. They
wear M-16s to back their authority, but the weapons aren't loaded.
Orders are to keep their ammo clips in their pockets. No accidents
that way.
   ``That's fine,'' says Calhoun. ``We'll get shot with a pocket
full of ammo.''
   Then he begins to sing one of his improvised songs.
   ``Why, oh, why, oh why...'' he goes in his irritating falsetto.
   Badger wants none of this. ``You best be stopping that,
Calhoun,'' he says, hefting his empty rifle. A civilian truck
drives up and the two warily check it out as the sun comes down
like a weight. The truck is cleared and the two resume their seats
on a rusting oil drum.
   Calhoun picks up where he left off. ``Why, oh, why, oh, why...''

   A ``Reporter's Notebook,'' story is a used in this profession to
clear the interesting odds and ends from your notebook at the end
of a story. It's a form of housecleaning.
   But it's hard to do after an intense two weeks with 14
individuals known collectively as the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment.
   What should you leave in and what should you leave out when
summing up an experience that started each day at 5:30 a.m. and
went strong past sunset? How can you remain detached? How do you
reach closure?
   Each member of the 265th is worthy of his own story: Hullie
Cohen's calm competence, Bobby Youman's interest in learning, Ed
Simmons' quiet anger. The group dynamics could make six sociology
case studies: Sgt. Jackson's leadership style and his relationship
with his men; Mark Rooker, 20 years old and white, and his place in
an otherwise all-black unit.
   But there is no room here even to begin. And now it's time to
leave.
   The story ends for me because I have to get on a plane for home.
It goes on for these men who will spend up to six months away from
their families.
   These are men who are very small cogs in the very large wheel of
history. But they are all people of depth and dignity.
   I will miss them more than I want to consider now, as I say
goodbye.

   It's late night on the Persian Gulf shore and even though its
been a long day, some of the men can't sleep. Don Graham and
Simmons, Earnie Deloach and Bill Bostick lean on a truck and tell
familiar stories on each other and the rest of the men asleep in
the tent.
   There are traces of rancor when some names come up. But no
lasting malice.
   ``Hell, we've been together so long we're use to each other,''
said Deloach. ``It's like family.''

   To Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the United States
Senate over the last 200 years has been a rock-bound channel, able
to contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing its
essential and original shape and purpose.
   Byrd, in what he calls a ``labor of love,'' has pursued that
theme in a seven-pound history of the institution as it developed
over the past two centuries.
   The book, called ``The Senate _ 1789-1989'' and available
through the Government Printing Office, is a lavishly illustrated
and meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches Byrd
delivered on the floor of the Senate in an unprecedented series
that began on a spring morning in 1980.
   ``One of my two granddaughters was in the gallery with other
members of her fifth-grade class,'' Byrd recalls. ``I decided I
should mark the occasion by talking a little about the Senate and
its history for that class.
   ``I had no notes; I spoke for an hour,'' he said.
   On the next Friday his older granddaughter was in the gallery
and Byrd decided to make another speech in her honor.
   ``But I thought I ought to make a different speech, so I talked
about the traditions and the customs of the Senate. That's how it
started; that was the seed of the idea. I determined there was
fully enough material to do 100 speeches on the Senate. I saw that
it was going to take a number of years.''
   For most of the next decade, when the business of the Senate had
been completed for the day, Byrd rose to advance his project
another notch, delivering what a generation of Senate clerks and
pages, and doorkeepers, reporters and fellow senators came to call
``Byrd's history lessons.''
   The result is a narrative history of the Senate from the
uncertain first steps of the first Congress in the late winter and
spring of 1789 through the calamity of civil war in the 1860s and
the Senate Watergate investigation of the 1970s.
   The assembly of those speeches into a book was a
``mini-Manhattan Project,'' Byrd says, proudly noting that he
proofread the book five times _ ``every comma, every colon, every
em-dash.''
   To Byrd, the most remarkable fact about the Senate's 200 years
is the way that historic themes tend to repeat themselves.
   Is there concern over the negative tone of last year's
presidential campaign? he asks.
   Then consider, Byrd says, the campaign of 1828 when the
partisans of John Quincy Adams called rival Andrew Jackson ``a
gambler, a drunkard and a duelist'' as well as an adulterer, and
Jackson supporters retaliated in kind, portraying Adams as ``a
monarchist, a gourmandizer and a spendthrift.''
   ``Slander was infectious,'' Byrd says.
   This year's 101st Congress opened with a donnybrook over a
proposed large congressional pay raise.
   Old hat, says Byrd.
   Pay squabbles date to the first Congress and began in earnest in
1816 when it was proposed that the pay rate of $6 a day be changed
to a $1,500 a year.
   The result: Public Outrage.
   The further result, according to Byrd: ``In the next election
two-thirds of the members of the House were defeated. Several
senators were also defeated and some resigned rather than stand for
re-election.''
   Also this year, the Senate tied itself into emotional knots over
President's Bush's nomination of former Sen. John Tower of Texas to
be secretary of defense, a battle that led to Tower's defeat.
   Nothing new in that, says Byrd.
   On a March day in 1843, President John Tyler's nomination of
Rep. Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts to be secretary of the Treasury
was rejected three times in three roll call votes on a single day.
   The Senate was in a nasty mood that day. It twice rejected
Tyler's nomination of Rep. Henry Wise of Virginia to be minister to
France and defeated his nominees to head the navy and war
departments and scuttled his nominee as minister to Brazil.
   To top things off, the Senate rejected Tyler's nomination of
John Spence for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Bush's experience with the Tower nomination can't compare to
that, Byrd says.
   Byrd said he hopes his history, which is available from the
Government Printing Office, will be a contribution to the
institutional memory of the place.
   ``Nothing has changed in 200 years,'' Byrd said. ``The Senate is
still guided by the Constitution and the knowledge that everything
that comes before it is just a new set of circumstances come to
center stage.''

   A 34-year-old man driving on Interstate 75
was killed when a cinder block was dropped from an overpass through
his windshield, causing him to lose control and crash.
   His two daughters, ages 9 and 11, were injured, authorities said.
   The Tuesday night crash, which killed Harold Parker of Macon,
followed by a few minutes a similar incident in which a 5-year-old
boy was injured, said Charles Johnson of the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation's Calhoun office.
   ``We don't know the motive other than just random meanness,'' he
said. ``We're looking at trying to locate who did it.''
   Annette Printup, a spokeswoman for the Georgia State Patrol post
in Calhoun, said the cinder block shattered the windshield of
Parker's Jeep five miles south of Calhoun.
   LaTonya Parker, 9, was hospitalized in serious condition and
Lamonda Parker, 11, was in stable condition.

   Paul McCartney says rock stars are
singing more about ecological issues because world leaders aren't
doing enough to protect the earth's environment.
   ``Governments _ especially George Bush and Margaret Thatcher _
aren't doing enough work,'' the former Beatle said at a news
conference Friday.
   The 47-year-old singer, his wife, Linda, their children and his
band have been in Rio since Wednesday for two shows expected to
break attendence records.
   Jeff Baker, McCartney's press spokesman, said 150,000 tickets
were sold for Friday's show and all 175,000 tickets were sold for
today's concert at Rio's Maracana soccer stadium, the world's
largest arena. Previously, the largest crowd to watch McCartney in
concert numbered 80,000.
   The Rio shows were to close a 33-city world concert tour. But
McCartney told reporters he was considering proposals to extend the
tour to Liverpool, England _ the Beatles' hometown _ in May.

   Argentines as interested in
Gabriela Sabatini's personal life as her tennis career are openly
nosy about the young German with whom the 20-year-old star returned
this week to Buenos Aires.
   ``Guess What the Young Woman Brought Home,'' the newspaper
Pagina 12 titled a story on Ms. Sabatini's return Monday. ``Gaby
Brought Her Boyfriend to Argentina,'' gushed Diario Popular.
   Reporters from newspapers, TV and radio stations beseiged Ms.
Sabatini for interviews.
   ``Frank Unterback is a very nice German boy and we're spending a
few very lovely days together,'' Ms. Sabatini told the newspaper La
Nacion. ``I'm very happy with my friend.''
   Having a husband and children are dreams of every woman, the
world's No. 4-ranked woman tennis player told ATC Channel 7, the
state station.
   A camera showed Unterback, a 24-year-old employee of a sports
store in Stuttgart, smiling hesitantly as her comments were
translated. The couple speak English to each other.

   Hundreds of Janet Jackson fans whooped and
hollered as Michael Jackson's sister received a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   ``I'm very honored and very proud,'' Miss Jackson told fans
jamming sidewalks, standing on cars and leaning out of office
windows on Vine Street on Friday. Police estimated the raucous
crowd at 1,800.
   The singer, clad in black boots, black jeans, black turtleneck
and a black baseball cap, was honored with the walk's 1,911th star,
next to one for rhumba king Xavier Cugat.

   Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the
summit of the world's highest mountain, will return to the Mount
Everest International Peace Climb expedition after hurting his leg.
   Whittaker, 61, of Port Townsend, will direct a group of
American, Soviet and Chinese climbers to the top, the expedition's
officials said in a statement. He plans to return to the mountain
on Thursday.
   Whittaker was forced to leave the expedition two weeks ago
because of a severely torn muscle in his left calf. He has received
medical treatment in Katmandu, Nepal. Deputy expedition leader
Warren Thompson led the climb in Whittaker's absence.
   Dianne Roberts, Whittaker's wife and the climb's executive
director, said the climbers expect to make attempts on the
29,028-foot summit about May 1.
   The expedition's goal is to place an American, a Soviet and a
Chinese climber together on the summit and, during descent, collect
trash and debris left by previous climbers on the mountain. The $1
million expedition began in February.
   Whittaker reached the top of Everest in 1963.

   ``Chattahoochee,'' a new movie based on
Chris Calhoun's efforts to reform inhumane and brutal conditions at
Florida State Hospital, is helping the former mental patient
fulfill a goal he set when he was released 28 years ago.
   ``I promised those who were left behind that I would let the
world know what happened there,'' Calhoun said in an interview
Friday.
   The film, named for the Florida Panhandle town where the
hospital is located, about 40 miles northwest of Tallahassee,
opened Friday in Los Angeles and New York and is scheduled to begin
appearing nationwide May 11.
   Although fictionalized, it is based on the real-life experiences
of Calhoun, a Korean War veteran who was suffering from what now is
known as post-traumatic stress syndrome.
   Calhoun, 56, was committed in 1956 after he shot himself in a
failed suicide attempt, and was released in 1962 after an
investigation spurred by letters he wrote that were smuggled from
the hospital.

   The district attorney's office said three
physicians who treated Elizabeth Taylor overprescribed narcotics
for the actress but will not be criminally prosecuted.
   ``It is clear that the prescribing practices of these physicians
fell below the accepted standard of medical practice,'' Deputy
District Attorney Daniel Feldstern wrote in a report on Drs.
William Skinner, Michael Gottlieb and Michael Roth.
   ``However, it is equally clear that these physicians, in trying
to resolve the patient's medical condition, were also attempting to
deal with her addiction through alternative means of therapy and
treatment, and that their conduct was lacking in the requisite
criminal intent.''
   The district attorney's office will refer the case to the state
medical board.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems, and
she was treated at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage for
alcohol and drug abuse.
   She was treated by the three doctors in 1987 and 1988. Among
drugs Skinner prescribed were Demerol, Percodan, Valium, Ativan,
Xanax, Preludin and Dilaudin.
   On Friday, meanwhile, Miss Taylor, 58, was in stable condition
with pneumonia at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa
Monica.

HENEFELD A REAL STEAL FOR HUSKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE BERKOWITZ, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it was over, they chanted: "Nadav! Nadav! Nadav!" 
</P>
<P>
But the scene was not Hartford Civic Center or Gampel Pavilion or Connecticut 
Field House or any other place the Connecticut Huskies have played this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Woodbury, Conn., in the locker room of Nonnewaug High School's boys 
basketball team. And Nonnewaug had just defeated neighboring Gilbert School 
after making eight steals in the fourth quarter of a game in January. 
</P>
<P>
"They do that in practice too," said Nonnewaug Coach Darryl Morhardt. "Anytime 
somebody makes a steal, they all yell 'Nadav!' " 
</P>
<P>
On the nation's Hot Team of the 1989-90 season, Nadav Henefeld is searing. He 
is a 6-foot-7 1/2, 219-pound, nearly-22-year-old freshman forward from Israel. 
Second in the nation in steals, with a school-record 115 in 28 games. Among 
Connecticut's top three in scoring, rebounding, assists, field-goal shooting, 
three-point shooting, free-throw shooting and blocked shots. Smart. Handsome. 
In serious demand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a legend here," said Steve Pikiell, a junior guard for the Huskies. "I'm 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know where Nadav (pronounced nah-DUV) is. Everyone wants to 
know what he's doing. Everyone wants to know what he's doing after games. You 
go to parties, and everyone's like, 'Where's Nadav? Where's Nadav?' People have 
been waiting for a winner here, and he's stepped in and become everyone's 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies never have finished higher than third in the Big East Conference. 
They have not finished higher than seventh since 1981-82. They were the only 
Big East team that did not participate in an NCAA tournament during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
With the Hartford Whalers as virtually the only other winter sports diversion 
in the state, the Huskies are subjected to almost microscopic scrutiny from 
about 30 Connecticut media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"This place," said the Bristol-raised Pikiell, "it's kind of crazy." 
</P>
<P>
And right now it's crazy for Nadav, who has been named Big East rookie of the 
week three times and became the first freshman to win the conference's 
player-of-the-week award. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld grew up in Ramat-Hasharon, not far from Tel Aviv. He said he began 
dreaming about playing college basketball in the United States when he was 
about 16. But like all Israelis, he went from high school to the military for 
three years of active duty. Not that this interfered with his basketball, you 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the army like a regular soldier," he said. "I had the basic 
training and that was it. The rest of my service in the army, I played more 
basketball than army. My service was as a sportsman, not as a regular soldier." 
</P>
<P>
He played for the Israeli national team, and began to acquire a reputation as 
one of his nation's best players. At about this time last year, with the end of 
his military-service commitment in sight, he wrote to about 20 U.S. colleges -- 
and received practically no response. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he was challenging Israel's club-basketball system in court. Israeli 
players are assigned to clubs based on where they grew up. Henefeld didn't want 
to play for the club that owned his rights, but the courts ruled against him. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Marv Kessler and Schmuel Zisman stepped in. Zisman was the lawyer 
who represented Henefeld. He also happened to have played in Israel for 
Kessler, a former head coach at Adelphi who now is a scout for the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Kessler saw Henefeld play in Israel and was convinced he could 
be a Division I player. 
</P>
<P>
So when Zisman told Kessler that Henefeld wanted to come to the United States, 
Kessler told one of his friends -- St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca. At 
Kessler's behest, Carnesecca invited Henefeld for a visit. At St. John's 
expense, Henefeld arrived in mid-April. He liked everything about the school 
except its lack of dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up visiting Connecticut on the day he was scheduled to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"He was leaving for Israel at 9 p.m.," Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said. "We 
had (assistant) Dave Leitao drive down, pick him up at 5:30 in the morning, and 
he spent that day here at UConn." 
</P>
<P>
It was a fine spring day, and Connecticut's bucolic campus was more in line 
with Henefeld's idea of what an American college should look like. Rolling, 
wooded hills instead of a concrete jungle. Dormitories instead of apartments. 
Yes, Henefeld decided during his hours in Storrs, this was the place. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun cemented the deal -- and satisfied his own questions about Henefeld -- 
by making a six-day trip to Israel in July for the Maccabiah Games. 
</P>
<P>
But there were complications. When Henefeld visited in April, he took the SAT 
but failed to attain the score required for eligibility as a freshman. 
Connecticut appealed to the NCAA to give him another chance in the fall because 
Henefeld didn't have a chance to prepare while in the army. The NCAA granted 
it, but in order the get the results back quickly enough to play this season, 
Henefeld had to fly to Raleigh, N.C. at his own expense in mid-October to take 
the test. He missed the first two weeks of practice while awaiting the score, 
which was a passing one. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NCAA received a mysterious letter, written in Hebrew, that 
claimed Henefeld had been paid to play in some games in Israel. Investigations 
by NCAA and Connecticut officials showed otherwise. His first formal workout 
with the Huskies came on Nov. 1 -- in an exhibition game against Marathon Oil. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld and the Huskies have been rolling since. They have set single-season 
school records for overall victories (24), Big East victories (11) and have 
attained their highest ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Tate George, their only senior, has become a consistent all-around 
player. Sophomore off-guard Chris Smith has blossomed into one of the nation's 
best back-court prospects. Junior guard John Gwynn has found happiness as a 
reserve, averaging 10.5 points in 17.2 minutes per game. Rod Sellers, the 6-9 
starting center, has become a scoring threat inside. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman swingman-baseball pitcher Scott Burrell spurned a huge contract offer 
from the Seattle Mariners, who made him their No. 1 draft choice last year, to 
become the third consecutive Connecticut high-school basketball player of the 
year to stay at home. Junior forwards Lyman DePriest and Murray Williams, and 
7-1 sophomore center Dan Cyrulik have become fine role players. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Henefeld's special mix of basketball skills, on-and off-court 
experiences, and personability come in. Like a mason using mortar to construct 
a path, Calhoun has used Henefeld to magically bond the Huskies, creating a 
yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
"Nadav has been the stabilizer," said Calhoun, who came to Connecticut after 14 
years at Northeastern, where he took a Division II program and built it into a 
perennial NCAA tournament participant that produced players such as Boston 
Celtics guard Reggie Lewis. "I think his age makes a difference, but he's a 
mature guy and he probably was mature at 18. The fact that he took on the 
Israeli club system a little bit helped. So, some of the things we see are 
chronological, but others are personality traits that make him somewhat unique. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was a kid with any kind of a sense of arrogance, I think it would be 
entirely different. He guards (his teammates') notoriety and their successes 
like he would an egg. He makes sure that does not crack." 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld seems to be even more captivating than those Big East imports who were 
all the rage for excellent teams last season -- Georgetown's Dikembe Mutombo 
and Seton Hall's Andrew Gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Said George: "Everyone kind of calls me The Governor because after four years I 
know a lot of people. After one year he knows the whole state, so we're trying 
to figure out what to call him." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's just the hurricane of attention that constantly swirls around the 
only show in a town smaller than Washington or New York, but perhaps it is the 
tremendous sense of pride Henefeld seems to inspire in his homeland and among 
Jews in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He did nothing to hurt this in November, when, with the NCAA's and 
Connecticut's permission, he went home to play an Israeli national-team game 
against France. He flew to Tel Aviv on Nov. 18, played on Nov. 22 (scoring 23 
points in an Israel victory), left two hours after the game and rejoined the 
Huskies 26 hours later -- in Anchorage for the Great Alaska Shootout, where in 
three games he totaled 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli flag has been waved in the crowd at many Connecticut home games, 
media outlets in Israel phone the school's sports-information office after 
every game and Jewish publications from all over the United States have written 
stories on Henefeld. Like everything else, he has taken it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that I can make people feel good about themselves or about me 
playing well here, and I really appreciate it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He would rather be just one of the guys. One of his early highlights was being 
chewed out for the first time by Calhoun, who can be wonderfully acerbic but 
was understandably gentle with Henefeld at first. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld also wants to be viewed as a student, not as a basketball mercenary -- 
what some accused Gaze of being last year when, after helping lead Seton Hall 
to the Final Four, he promptly bolted for home. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons I'm here are many," Henefeld said. "To play basketball, of course, 
but also to get an education and see another place and experience another 
culture. I think that other than an education, you can get so many things from 
seeing another place and living in another culture and meeting some new people. 
I think it helps you as a person. So it's not just the sport." 
</P>
<P>
This was the approach preached to him by Moti Daniel, an Israeli who played for 
George Washington from 1985 to 1987 and with whom Henefeld is friendly.

   Brilliantly colored fall foliage was coated with snow and ice
Thursday in the mountains of North Carolina and frost headed as far
south as Alabama.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended during the afternoon over
North Carolina, South Carolina, northeastern Georgia, eastern
Tennessee and southwestern Virginia.
   The rain was mixed with snow in the Appalachians and changed
completely to snow at higher elevations.
   ``It was very pretty on these colored leaves,'' said Beulah
Calhoun at Calhoun Farm Supply in Newland, N.C.
   Elsewhere in North Carolina, 8 inches of snow accumulated at
Mount Mitchell and Mount Pisgah got a little more than an inch, the
National Weather Service reported. The National Park Service closed
two sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina because of
snow.
   ``I hear there is enough to scrape up a snowball,'' said Hugh
Morton at Grandfather Mountain.
   In eastern Tennessee, snow closed the Clingman Dome road in the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the weather service said.
   At lower elevations in North Carolina, thunderstorms produced
locally heavy rain at Charlotte, including 1.50 inches in the six
hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, and across much of Mecklenburg County,
flooding some streets and roads, the weather service said.
   Hail about an inch in diameter fell at Locust, N.C.
   A tornado warning was issued for part of eastern North Carolina
after a waterspout was spotted offshore. The waterspout, a tornado
that forms over water, did not come ashore.
   Cold air headed southward across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys
with temperatures expected to reach the low 30s by Friday morning
in northern Alabama, and the mid to upper 30s across central and
southern Alabama.
   Frost advisories were posted over much of Kentucky and frost
warnings were issued over southwestern Ohio. Advisories for frost
and freezing temperatures were posted over Indiana and southeastern
Lower Michigan.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered over western New York state and
northeastern Ohio.
   Rain extended from north-central and western Washington state
into northwestern Oregon.
   Strong, gusty wind blew across the northern Pacific Coast during
the morning, with gusts reaching 44 mph at Astoria, Ore., 47 mph at
Bellingham, Wash., and 56 mph at Seaside, Ore.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 19 degrees in
Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Chippewa County Airport, Mich., to 96 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>CHARLESTOWN: Madoc legend.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``In professional archaeological circles, it's kind of
pooh-poohed,'' says Steve Cox, curator of the Tennessee State
Museum. ``There's no archaeological evidence. That's really all that
we have to go on in the prehistoric period.''
   The legend says the Welsh Indians were forced out of Tennessee by
the Cherokee Indians. Three separate northerly routes took them into
Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley.
   American Indians apparently first spread the tale of a race of
White Indians who lived in the Falls of the Ohio area, where Madoc's
followers may have established their largest settlement.
   George Rogers Clark, the founder of Clarksville, Ind., first
heard the story from Tobacco, a chief of the Piankeshaws. He told of
a great battle between the Red Indians and White Indians on the Ohio
River's Sand Island where all the White Indians were slain.
   Maj. John Harrison, among others, has told of an extensive
graveyard in that area, where thousands of human bones were buried
in such confusion as to suggest a battle. The graveyard, if it
existed, has been washed away.
   Some of Clark County's earliest settlers reportedly found ancient
coins and European armor, some bearing the Welsh coat of arms. All
of that armor has disappeared.
   Clark found some skeletons adorned in armor that he thought were
ancient Welshmen and jotted down his findings in his personal
memoirs, Olson says. A copy of this book, in Clark's own hand, was
stolen years ago from the Jeffersonville public library.
   ``Baird's History of Clark County'' says that a tombstone, with
the date 1186, was found in Jeffersonville in the 1800s. Early
pioneers reportedly found native Indians throughout the interior who
could converse in the Welsh language.
   A skull taken from Sand Island in the 1800s was pronounced by a
Dr. Beckwith as ``not that of an Indian.'' Beckwith's qualifications
are not known.
   None of the evidence has been scientifically examined or
confirmed. In fact, virtually all of it has mysteriously disappeared.
   ``I wish I could reproduce everything that's been found or that
it had been put in a museum,'' Olson says. ``There are no museums
here.''
   Without such proof, archaeologists and other experts have their
doubts.
   ``Where you find prehistoric or human occupation you normally
find a range of evidence, such as refuse, garbage, settlements,
villages, sites, artifacts,'' says Gary Ellis, senior archaeologist
for the state of Indiana.
   ``There just isn't any. Most of it is rumor.''
   More likely, Indian scholars say, the stone fort was built by
native American Indians.
   ``A lot of people don't like to believe the Indians could have
stacked rocks that size, but there's evidence around the country
they did things like that,'' says Donna Calhoun of rural Scottsburg,
who is writing a history of Indians in southern Indiana.
   Ray White, tribal chairman of the Miami Indian nation, suggested
the coins, lamps, armor and other artifacts could easily have
traveled inland via the Indian trading network. A diary Calhoun
uncovered during her research locates an Indian trading post 1{
miles east of Charlestown.
   Yet Olson says the evidence supporting the legend is overwhelming.
   ``What something like this does is alter the apple cart of
history,'' Olson says. ``Anytime you get all this and put it before
all these people who've got degrees in anthropology, it really turns
the table. They don't know how to combat it, so they say, `No, this
is a myth.'''
   An archaeological overview done in 1984 predicted the research
value of Devil's Backbone could be quite high. Under federal law,
any Indian mounds and artifacts must be protected from development
there.
   They could provide a unique look into southern Indiana's early
beginnings.
   Or, they could lend credence to a legend and shatter accepted
theories on the discovery and exploration of America.
   ``We need somebody to go into Charlestown and just do a survey,''
White says. ``They really need to find out what's there.
   ``It's bound to tell something about the early, early Indiana
history, before what they're teaching in the schools. It's very
important.''

courtyard of the Nickelodeon theater. A video crew was on the rooftop next
door. Movie fans with cameras milled about. People seemed nervous, expectant.;
  Rory Calhoun, one-time leading man to Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was
coming home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Rita Bottoms, curator of special collections at the University of
California, Santa Cruz library and a "major fan" of Calhoun's, was there. She
talked about how she filled boxes with Calhoun newspaper clippings as a girl,
burned them when she went off to college (too old to have a crush on a movie
star), and always regretted it. At the edge of the crowd was 75-year-old
Walter Reed, a Santa Cruzan whose acting credits included "Yellow Tomahawk," a
1954 Western in which he appeared with Calhoun. They hadn't seen each other in
more than 25 years.;   Shortly after 7:30 p.m., two shiny antique cars filled
with dignitaries pulled up by the sidewalk. Bruce Bratton, the bearded writer
and publicist who organized the event, stood on a bench and bellowed the
star's arrival.;   Calhoun, star of "The Texan" on TV and, more recently,
"Motel Hell," stepped out of a '67 Cutlass convertible. His wife, Sue,
followed and the crowd exploded with applause. "I love you!" one woman
yelled.;   Calhoun, 69, was wearing a cowboy hat, denim jacket, jeans and
black cowboy boots. His thick hair, once black, is now silver. His face is
thinner than in his matinee-idol days, but he still has those big, soulful
eyes that drove people crazy. Smiling and looking a bit overwhelmed by the
reception, Calhoun walked into the courtyard and shouted in his gravelly
voice, "Where's my cousin Tom?";   Tom Fast, of Scotts Valley, stepped out of
the crowd into a hard embrace.;   Then came the proclamations honoring the
native son who moved to Santa Cruz with his mother in 1927 when he was 5, and
grew up running through its pear and apple orchards, playing hooky in the
hills outside town with his dog Rags, and generally getting into mischief in
what he calls "a real Tom Sawyer existence.";   Mayor Jane Yokoyama said the
city was lucky that Calhoun considered Santa Cruz to be his hometown.;   "No,
I'm lucky," Calhoun answered, teary-eyed.;   Then Calhoun got down on his
knees in front of a sidewalk square of wet cement -- the way the stars have
done it at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. He leaned forward on all
fours, pressed his hands into the cement and wiggled them to leave two large
imprints. And he wrote this in the concrete: "My (hrt) is here. Rory Calhoun.
9-21-91";   "Leave room for your feet, honey," his wife advised him.;  
Calhoun stepped into the bottom corner of the concrete square. His
immortalization completed, he pumped a hand in the air, and the crowd cheered
once again.;   (hbox);   Earlier in the day, the first of two filled with
events honoring Calhoun and raising money for Santa Cruz groups, he sat in his
hotel room. It overlooked the very beach where he dug holes in the sand to
cook potatoes 60 years ago, when he was known as Francis McCown. "David
Selznick gave me the name Rory Calhoun, and those are the only two names I've
known -- except sonofabitch," he says, laughing and dragging on a cigarette.; 
 His mother, Betty, was a waitress at Tommy Rudell's coffee shop on Pacific
Avenue downtown, and they lived nearby -- right near where the Nickelodeon now
stands. The way Calhoun tells it, he was one rambunctious youngster: "You
could steal a couple of milk bottles off somebody's porch and turn 'em in at
the creamery for a nickel apiece, and maybe you'd steal four of 'em and you'd
have enough for candy for the whole day." He took his candy to the Unique
Theater on Pacific Avenue where he saw "King Kong," Buck Jones adventure
movies and lots of westerns.;   "Tell him about your dog, Rags," Sue Calhoun
says. "I think that's where he got the nickname 'Smoke.' He and that dog would
disappear -- like smoke -- up in the hills and nobody knew where they were."; 
 "I had a .22 single-shot rifle," Calhoun says, picking up the story, "and I'd
take a frying pan, blanket, some matches and a bottle, and Rags, and I'd
disappear. Didn't matter if there was school or not; I'd disappear for a few
days. Go up there and catch some trout, shoot myself a rabbit and live it up.
Then they'd bring me back, and I'd sit in the police station every day after
school for a month.";   He says he was 9 years old.;   Run-ins with the law;  
Calhoun moved to Los Angeles with his mother in 1936, was sent to reform
school for stealing cars, and returned to Santa Cruz three years later. He
attended Santa Cruz High School for three months, he says, "but I got bored
with that, so I stole a couple more cars and sold 'em, and they caught me."
The memory of the local police chief still gives him the jitters. Calhoun
returned to reform school near Sonora for another 2 1/2 years. "And that's why
I'm laughing -- when I was 17, they couldn't wait to get rid of me, and now
they're bringing me back!";   After his stint, he moved to San Jose. World War
II was on, and he worked in a defense plant in Sunnyvale. "But that was kind
of like being in jail," he says, so he took a job with the state Division of
Forestry in Felton, fighting forest fires and building communication lines.
Around St. Patrick's Day 1944, he took a vacation to visit his grandmother in
Los Angeles, and that's where his life changed.;   Waiting for a trolley in
Culver City, he was enlisted as an extra in a mob scene being filmed nearby.
He never found out what movie it was for, but "they gave me $37. I said,
'Jesus, how long has this been going on?' " Another of the extras, a hustler,
must have recognized Calhoun's good looks, because he dragged Calhoun to a
talent agency. The agency arranged a contract with 20th Century Fox for
Calhoun, and the hustler took a cut.;   Calhoun doesn't have sleazy stories to
tell about the Hollywood crowd; producers didn't cheat him, fellow actors
didn't back-stab him. Edward G. Robinson, while filming "The Red House" in the
'40s, even showed Calhoun how to position himself before the camera so that
editors couldn't cut him out of close-ups with the star.;   In the mid-'50s,
while filming "River of No Return" with Marilyn Monroe in the Canadian
Rockies, Calhoun came down with a horrendous case of the flu: "I had all the
heat on in this room, and covered myself with blankets and what-have-you. It
must've been 110 degrees in that room; I decided I was just going to sweat it
out. Well, Marilyn was the only one who'd come in there and sit with me, put
cold cloths on my head, made me hot lemon and honey. I don't know if it
helped, but it sure was nice having someone there who cared.";   Calhoun's
heyday lasted only into the '60s, but he continued making films, more than 75
in all. There were "Mule Feathers," "Angel" and more than a dozen others
during the '70s and '80s. On television he appeared on "Hawaii Five-O,"
"Fantasy Island" and "Hart to Hart." He had a leading role on the soap opera
"Capitol" from 1982-87. Nothing to bowl you over, to say the least. But even
at the height of his popularity, says old friend Walter Reed, Calhoun hadn't
taken himself too seriously.;   "Y'know, we have a deal in Hollywood -- don't
believe your own publicity," Reed says, "and Rory never did that.";   (hbox); 
 After putting his bootprints in the cement Saturday night, Calhoun signed
autographs. Then everyone filed into the theater to watch "Way of A Gaucho" in
which Calhoun played an honorable, headstrong cowboy on the Argentine pampa.
His co-star in the film, made in 1952, was Gene Tierney -- that was one
attractive couple.;   Before the film rolled, Calhoun stood onstage with
Bratton for some chitchat. The movie was made in Argentina and Juan Peron, the
dictator, took more than a passing interest in its production. Peron, in fact,
stocked the production staff with ex-Nazi S.S. troops: "They'd come over after
the war and they were all on the picture," Calhoun said. "And at night, they'd
call Buenos Aires and report on every move we'd made that day. Who got drunk,
who got -- and all that kind of stuff.";   Calhoun cracked up at that
recollection. A few moments later, to more applause, he left the stage. He sat
down next to his wife -- sharing a big bowl of popcorn -- and the credits
rolled.  </TEXT>

   Today is Sunday, Jan. 29, the 29th day of 1989. There are 336
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Jan. 29, 1820, Britain's King George III died insane at
Windsor Castle, ending a reign that had seen both the American and
French revolutions.
   On this date:
   In 1843, the 25th President of the United States, William
McKinley, was born in Niles, Ohio.
   In 1845, Edgar Allan Poe's poem ``The Raven'' was published under
a pseudonym in the ``New York Evening Mirror.''
   In 1850, Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a compromise bill on
slavery which included the admission of California into the Union as
a free state.
   In 1861, Kansas became the 34th state of the Union.
   In 1900, the American League, consisting of eight baseball teams,
was organized in Philadelphia.
   In 1936, the first members of baseball's Hall of Fame, including
Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth, were named in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   In 1958, actors Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward were married.
   In 1963, the first members of football's Hall of Fame were named
in Canton, Ohio.
   In 1963, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert Frost died in Boston.
   In 1980, it was revealed that six U.S. diplomats in Iran who
escaped the takeover of the American embassy had been smuggled out
of the country with the help of the Canadian embassy.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter formally welcomed Chinese
Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping to the White House, where the two leaders
held a four-hour meeting, followed by a state dinner.
   Five years ago: Saying, ``Our work is not finished,'' President
Ronald Reagan announced in a nationally broadcast message that he
and Vice President George Bush would seek re-election in the fall.
   One year ago: Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega received a
coolly polite reception from Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. A
Boston-bound Amtrak train derailed in Chester, Pa.; safety officials
later blamed both Amtrak and a control tower operator under the
influence of drugs for the mishap that injured 25 people.
   Today's birthdays: Comedian ``Professor'' Irwin Corey is 77.
Actor Victor Mature is 73. Actor John Forsythe is 71. Author
Germaine Greer is 50. Actress Claudine Longet is 47. Actress
Katharine Ross is 46. Actor Tom Selleck is 44. Actress Ann Jillian
is 38. Talk show host Oprah Winfrey is 35. Olympic diver Greg
Louganis is 29.
   Thought for today: ``Faith is nothing but spiritualized
imagination.'' _Henry Ward Beecher, American clergyman and social

<TEXT>
   Seven score and one year ago, the A.
Lincoln who visited this seashore town may have been just a grocer
from Philadelphia.
   But some residents continue to insist it was the future 16th
president who stayed in a hotel in this resort community on July
31, 1849.
   Those who dispute the tale say Lincoln, whose birthday comes
Monday, was in Springfield, Ill., practicing law that long-ago July
31, winning a judgment of $112.30 for a client. Casting further
doubt is a record of an Abel Lincoln, a Philadelphia grocer who
they say may have headed to the Jersey shore that summer day.
   ``All these years, we may have been honoring a grocer,'' said
Jake Schaad, who has researched the story and is writing a book
about the history of Cape May.
   One version of the story claims that, while in Cape May, Lincoln
rejected an offer to become governor of the Oregon Territory after
his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, told him she was afraid of Indians,
Schaad said.
   ``It's a good story but it didn't happen,'' Schaad said, adding
that other versions have Lincoln fathering an illegitimate son
while at the shore.
   The town claims to be America's oldest seashore resort, tracing
its visitors to just after the Revolutionary War, said Jeffrey
Dorwart, a history professor at Rutgers University-Camden who is
researching a book for Cape May County's 300th anniversary in 1992.
   Some long-time residents knew Henry Irick, who said that when he
was 16 he came with his father and Lincoln to this community of
Victorian homes and lazy sea breezes.
   Mary Ann Nyblade, a 65-year-old Cape May resident who can trace
her family in the town back to 1695, said she still clings to
Irick's story.
   Irick was the son of John S. Irick, a wealthy Vincentown farmer
who supposedly met up with Lincoln and came to the Mansion House in
Cape May. He recalled that visit in a newspaper interview in the
late 1890s and the story was born, Ms. Nyblade said.
   The Mansion House guest register shows an A. Lincoln and wife
from Philadelphia in Room 24. Fire destroyed the hotel in 1856 but
the register was saved, Ms. Nyblade said. She acknowledged that the
reference to Philadelphia on the register was a problem for the
future-president theorists, but say the future president may have
listed Philadelphia if they had taken the steamboat from there to
Cape May.
   The man who saved that register was Lewis Stevens, and the
250-page book is now in Huntsville, Ala., in a safe-deposit box
owned by Bill Stevens, Ms. Nyblade's nephew and a descendant of
Lewis Stevens.
   Bill Stevens said in a telephone interview that the register
contains signatures of other famous people such as Sen. Henry Clay.
However, he said he has learned too much about Lincoln to believe
he could have visited Cape May.
   ``I'm convinced he was not in Cape May at that time,'' he said.
   There's no doubt about that, said Thomas F. Schwartz, curator of
the Lincoln collection at the Illinois State Historical Library in
Springfield.
   On July 31, Lincoln was at least 1,000 miles west of Cape May,
filing an affidavit in Sangamon County Circuit Court for Henry
Bailer, who was owed $111.75 by Oliver Davis. Davis ended up paying
$112.30, which Schwartz guesses included interest.
   Dorwart said he can prove President Benjamin Harrison spent
summers in Cape May, as did President U.S. Grant and Woodrow Wilson
while he was governor of New Jersey. But Lincoln is a different
story.
   ``My sense is that, since looking at the Lincoln papers, he was
in Illinois,'' Dorwart said.
   He said residents of Cape May, 50 miles south of the Mason-Dixon
Line and site of several duels between Northerners and Southerners
in the 1840s and 1850s, may have been trying to prove their loyalty
to the Union after the Civil War by circulating the story.
   Irick's tale probably cemented the story as fact, Dorwart said.
   The Cape May County Historical Museum still features a facsimile
of the hotel register signature and everybody acknowledges that
some legends just seem to die hard.
   ``Even if Lincoln didn't come down here, it's part of our
culture that he was here,'' Dorwart said.

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Ursula Meese, and Others </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<G> JUS CNG </G>
<TEXT>
   Amid the stories about the two resigned Justice Department officials yesterday, the Washington Post had another story: "Independent Counsel Subpoenas Ursula Meese's Job Records." 
It now develops that Independent Counsel James McKay is investigating Mrs. Meese's $40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
"According to sources familiar with McKay's inquiry, the independent counsel has been trying to determine whether the Meeses' close friend, E. Bob Wallach, in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Ursula Meese for the jobs." 
Mrs. Meese's job is matching MS patients with employers. 

   Whatever is going on here, the one thing we may fairly conclude is that it is worthy of investigation. But if it merits the attention of special prosecutors and reporters, then the town may hold enough such stories to command the attention of many such investigations. Last December, a UPI reporter produced a long story listing 73 relatives of House and Senate members who have worked for Congress in paid jobs since mid-1986. By law, members may not hire their own relatives, but the law says nothing about them working for other Members or for Congress itself. Here is a partial state-by-state summary, current at the time of UPI's story:
   American Samoa: Fiti Sunia, son of Delegate Fofo Sunia, works in the office of California Rep. Mervyn Dymally. 
"It's hard to get a position if you come in right off the street," says Fiti Sunia. 
Vaaomala Sunia, another of Fofo Sunia's sons, works as a Capitol Hill policeman. 

   Arizona: Vincent Fabrizio, stepson of Rep. Morris Udall is a staff member for the House Public Works Committee, chaired until last week by the late Rep. James Howard.

He was hired before his brother's election, and reports that he has seen at least one congressional relative walk into a Member's office and "come out in a second with a job. . . . 
It is that easy when you know someone." 

   Massachusetts: Christopher Moakley, nephew of Rep. John Moakley, worked in six different temporary congressional jobs between 1982 and 1986, four of them patronage jobs controlled by his uncle.

   When a friend of mine takes the elevated train home to Oak Park, a western suburb here, she makes a point of sitting away from the window. 
She worries she might get hit by gunfire while passing the Henry Horner Homes project. 

   Pharoah Walton, age 9, lives in Henry Horner. 
For him, the shooting is so frequent and intrusive that he's learned over the years to look both ways before running when he hears gunfire. 

   Our inner-city neighborhoods, particularly public housing projects, have become islands of violence, isolated both geographically and in spirit from the rest of us. 
Delivery trucks and taxis dare not venture into these embattled neighborhoods, which are cordoned off by boulevards and highways rather than by walls or rivers. 
Many residents don't have telephones; there aren't even any supermarkets within walking distance. 
There is, say residents, a feeling of terrible aloneness. 

   Most disturbing, however, is how little we know or care about what happens on these inner-city reefs. 
Most of us are like my friend, for whom the neighborhood is a blur and the violence a momentary but passing threat. 

   Local newspapers and television news programs rarely report on stabbings and shootings at Henry Horner. 
Even the police, who must deal with it daily, don't record it all. 
Joseph Gardner, a former executive at the Chicago Housing Authority, the landlord for the city's approximately 40,000 public housing units, concedes that "after 4:30 the gangs run these developments." 

   Indeed, they do. 
I regularly visited Henry Horner Homes over a period of three months to report an Oct. 27 page one story of a 12-year-old's almost daily confrontation with violence. 
I have remained friends with Lafeyette Walton and his family, and just a few weeks ago met a 17-year-old friend of theirs. 
Later that night he was gunned down and killed. 

   It's hard to avoid trouble at the project. 
This summer 14-year-old Lolita Strong miraculously survived an errant bullet that lodged in her skull. 
One mother won't let her three young children play on the playground's rusted Jungle Gym. 
Instead, she moves all her furniture to the side and the living room becomes their "outside." 

   The police are overwhelmed by the problem and, perhaps, a bit fearful themselves. 
One foot patrolman told me he won't go above the first floor in Henry Horner's high-rises without a partner. 
After a big gun battle early in the summer in which young gang members shot at each other from building to building like battleships at sea, I called the police department's central headquarters to ask what was on record about the shoot-out. 
I was told that if such combat took place, the newspapers would have written about it and the city's top police officials would have discussed it at their morning briefing. 
Thus it must not have happened. 

   But it did. 
I arrived at Henry Horner within half an hour of the shooting and, over the next few weeks, talked with residents (both children and parents), community workers and policemen -- all of whom recounted the battle. 

   The city's response to the growing violence has been muted at best. 
Henry Horner residents say the only contact they have with local politicians is around election time -- and even then it's nominal. 
Chicago narrowly averted losing control of the Housing Authority to the federal government in a power struggle that all but neglected the needs of the CHA's tenants. 
But Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) on a recent trip to Chicago visited five mothers from Henry Horner to discuss what might be done about the violence. 
The women asked for tighter security, better screening of tenants and a police phone number they could call with anonymous tips. 

   The CHA's Mr. Gardner requested a meeting with me last month at which, in a kind of cathartic exercise, he reeled off the agency's frustration in trying to diminish the violence in the projects. 
In August, the agency replaced its security guards with off-duty police officers, he said, but funds for the program ran out in October. 
"CHA as a landlord can't solve this problem by itself," he sighed. 
As for Mr. Gardner, at the end of our meeting he said that he was leaving the agency the following week to run for a seat on the commission that oversees the city's sewage disposal. 

   Some compare Henry Horner and other such communities with war zones like Beirut and Northern Ireland. 
And there are similarities. 
In Belfast, for example, the IRA "kneecaps" people who have disobeyed its laws. 
In the projects, people are shot in the legs for disobeying the gangs' rules. 

   But there is one major difference: In Beirut and Northern Ireland, adults -- and children -- can direct their anger and bitterness toward political targets, with some long-shot aim of change. 
In Henry Horner, no such opponent or dream exists. 

   When the apartment next to the Waltons was firebombed this fall, there was no public outcry. 
No political leader came forth to say that this must stop. 
The news media didn't run major stories on the terrorist attack. 
The police didn't come out in full force. 
Even the local residents took it in stride. 
In the jargon of Henry Horner, just another apartment was "cocktailed." 

   Henry Horner is not an anomaly. 
In a memo to his staff, John Calhoun, executive director of the National Crime Prevention Council, wrote of a recent visit to Detroit, a city whose neighborhoods have become virtual battlefields: "When I worked on the streets with kids in the '60s, there was also the grinding poverty visible in Detroit, perhaps more, but there was a difference. 
People were on the sidewalk and in the streets; the church was still a powerful voice; whatever shred of family existed spoke with authority. 
There was hope. 
Facing the Detroit {of today}, I was frightened -- not for my safety, but for the future of these children . . . . 
The kids are colossally, terribly alone." 

   Says a mother at Henry Horner Homes: "Bringing up a child where I do, you can lose them." 
Indeed, we've already lost entire communities. 

   Within days after my story on Lafeyette Walton came out, the family heard that the gangs were angry about the article. 
So Lafeyette's mother, LaJoe, panicked and took Lafeyette, Pharoah and her four-year-old triplets to her sister's house in a nearby neighborhood. 

   "Then I had time enough to think," she recalls. 
"What am I running for if I ain't done nothing? 
I was afraid when I left. 
I was just mostly hurting when I came back." 
The gangs, thank God, have not harmed the Waltons. 
But Mrs. Walton says she stays up nights worrying about her children. 
So might we all.
