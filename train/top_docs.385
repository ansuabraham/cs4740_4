   A striped shellfish now clogging water system
pipelines and threatening the ecological balance of the Great Lakes
could make its way to rivers around the country in as little as
five years, scientists say.
   The rapidly producing zebra mussels could pose a significant
problem for manufacturing plants, many of which have miles of pipes
that draw cooling water, the experts warn.
   The mussels eventually will attach themselves to the insides of
pipes supplying factories and municipal water plants, in some cases
restricting flow, in the Allegheny, Ohio and Monongahela rivers,
said Thomas Nalepa, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   The Mississippi River basin also is vulnerable because Lake
Michigan, where the mussels are expected to arrive soon, is
connected to the Mississippi by the Chicago Canal.
   However, there is no reliable way to determine exactly when the
1{-inch mollusk will arrive in these or other rivers around the
country, scientists said.
   Zebra mussels, so named because of their brown and white zigzag
stripes, have been found in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and Lake St.
Clair, near Detroit.
   They are growing on spawning reefs favored by walleye,
smallmouth bass and other fish in western Lake Erie, raising
concern about the future of a valuable fishery.
   Like barnacles, zebra mussels can travel by clinging to boat
hulls. They can survive out of water for perhaps up to 14 days by
living on internal moisture.
   ``Let's say someone from Pittsburgh were to trailer their boat
up to fish on Lake Erie and ended up with zebra mussels that
attached to their hull,'' said David Kelch, a specialist with Ohio
State University's sea grant program.
   ``They take their boat back to Pittsburgh and in a day or two
put the boat into a river or lake in that area. You've got them.''
   What's more, the larvae, or young, which are microscopic in
size, easily can attach themselves to an angler's minnow bucket, a
water nook in a boat trailer or the feathers of a duck.
   The zebra mussel originated in the Black and Caspian seas
between Europe and Asia. In 200 years, it has spread through much
of Europe. Two years ago, it was discovered in Lake St. Clair and
has infested water intakes for Erie, Toledo, Cleveland and Monroe,
Mich.
   The mussel reproduces at an astonishing rate. A single female
produces as many as 40,000 eggs each breeding season.
   The mollusk also has a voracious appetite for phytoplankton,
which are microscopic floating plants that form the bottom of the
food chain. Mussels could reduce the supply of phytoplankton for
microscopic animals called zooplankton. The zooplankton, in turn,
are eaten by smaller fish, which are eaten for food by larger fish.
   ``Anytime you impact the basic bottom building block of the food
chain, you're going to see an impact on the top predators _
walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch,'' Kelch said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - They are alien creatures of the deep, unknown in
the waters of the United States until a few years ago. They can cut
off the water supply of cities, ruin boat engines, and scientists
worry that they will upset the aquatic food chain. The invasion of
the zebra mussels, which began in the Great Lakes, is expected to
spread to waterways across the land.

   Microscopic at birth, the tiny invaders
ride the currents of the Great Lakes searching for a home along the
rocky lake bottom, or better yet, on a man-made structure.
   Life is easy with few natural predators and plenty of solid
structures to attach their hairlike tentacles. And laying 30,000
eggs a year does more than just keep the family heritage going.
   They grow to the size of a pistachio nut within two years as the
zigzagged stripes begin appearing on their army-green shells. Man
is little deterrent to their population explosion because he's
still trying to understand them.
   ``At first we couldn't identify it,'' says Monroe water plant
superintendent Wilfred LePage. ``A couple months later, biologists
told us, `You have zebra mussels and you may never be rid of them
again.'''
   That was in January 1989. Last December, a colony of zebra
mussels and ice clogged Monroe's only water intake from Lake Erie,
cutting the flow to a trickle. Businesses and schools were closed,
hospital surgeries were postponed and the city went to a local
river and nearby Toledo for water during the two-day emergency.
   ``We went through hell,'' LePage says.
   The event earned Monroe a reputation as the Pearl Harbor of the
zebra mussel invasion. Eventually, the fingernail-sized, inedible
mollusk is expected to spread beyond the Great Lakes to lakes and
rivers in 60 percent of the country.
   ``The lesson I'm trying to get out to water plants is, `Get
ready, because they're gonna come.''' LePage says. ``And when they
do, things happen so fast. Then you'll have to pull out all the
stops just to keep your plant running.''
   Some already know.
   -The city of Detroit water department, which provides drinking
water for 42 percent of Michigan's 9 million residents, this year
built a chlorination plant to control zebra mussels at one of its
three water intakes.
   -The U.S. Coast Guard is finding zebra mussels on the bottoms of
some of its navigational buoys and vessels in the Great Lakes.
Marinas in Lake Erie report the zebra mussels have been found
blocking water intakes for engine cooling systems.
   -The four major steel companies in northwest Indiana have
received variances from their pollution discharge permits allowing
them to use molluscicides to kill zebra mussels at their water
intakes in Lake Michigan.
   -Electric utilities along Lake Erie are stepping up their
inspections of water intakes for coal-burning and nuclear power
plants. Detroit Edison estimates it will spend $500,000 next year
for a zebra mussel control program at its Monroe coal-burning
plant.
   The coming of the zebra mussel has ramifications beyond just
water plants. Scientists worry that they will alter the aquatic
food chain, that mollusk-borne toxins will end up in sport fish and
waterfowl, and that zebra mussels will disturb fish-spawning
grounds and clog water intakes critical for farm irrigation.
   The mussels also cling to boat hulls and boat engines, and their
shells can slice the feet of beachgoers. They are the Great Lakes'
version of the leaf-eating gypsy moth caterpillar or the
Africanized ``killer'' bee.
   ``The zebra mussel is likely to spread much more quickly than
the gypsy moth,'' says Richard Moll, assistant director of the
Michigan Sea Grant program. ``I would imagine in a couple decades
they'll be found throughout the U.S.''
   Like the gypsy moth, the zebra mussel was inadvertently imported
into the United States from Europe, probably aboard a freighter. It
is one of about 115 foreign species that have been introduced into
the Great Lakes by man, intentionally and unintentionally,
according to Ed Mills, a senior research scientist with Cornell
University in Ithaca, New York.
   The zebra mussel is believed to have entered the Great Lakes
area when the freighter of uncertain flag emptied its ballast water
into Lake St. Clair in 1985 or 1986. It has been sighted in each of
the Great Lakes and is moving to inland waterways by hitchhiking on
boats, boat trailers, bait pails and even waterfowl.
   It conceivably can live in waters throughout the temperate
region of the United States, which includes about 60 percent of the
country, and southern Canada. In New York state, the zebra mussel
is moving eastward from Buffalo along the Erie Canal. The Finger
Lakes aren't far behind.
   ``They'll be colonized fairly soon,'' says Robert Lange, a
biologist with the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation. ``They are working through the Erie Canal east. So
far they've reached Rochester and eventually they'll reach the
Hudson.''
   The Mississippi River is expected to be colonized by Great Lakes
mussels entering either in Minnesota or through the Illinois River
near St. Louis.

   Lake Erie has the greatest infestation, but scientists hold out
hope that the other Great Lakes will experience only small
invasions because they don't have the rocky bottom structure Lake
Erie has.
   The zebra mussel is so dangerous because it can reproduce so
quickly. A fully mature female can produce more than 30,000 eggs
per season. The eggs are fertilized outside the shell and hatch
into free-swimming larvae called veligers.
   The veligers can remain suspended in the water for one to three
weeks, allowing currents to scatter them. If they don't settle on
firm objects in that time period, they die. Those that find a hard
surface attach to it with extremely strong tentacle-like threads.
The zebra mussel is mature at one year and can live to about 4
years old and grow to about 1{ inches long.
   ``The older they get, the tougher they are to remove,'' says
Gerry Mackie, a researcher at the University of Guelph in Ontario.
``Nothing or very few things can pry it off the rock. That makes it
tough for predators.''
   And the zebra mussel has few natural predators outside of the
diving duck and sheepshead fish.
   The zebra mussel has flourished in Lake Erie, where it filters
plankton from the water. An adult can filter about a quart of water
per day, and that's what concerns scientists about the impact on
the food chain.
   ``The current situation is the plankton is out in the open
water,'' Mills says. ``With the zebra mussel, which settles on the
bottom, they will be removing particles from the open water. More
of this food is going to be channeled to the bottom. Getting this
food to a salmon is going to be less efficient.''
   Researchers say it's too early to tell how the zeb mussel will
affect sport fishing. They say there could be an increase in mussel
predators such as the bottom-feeding sheepshead, but it's unknown
how they will affect more sought-after fish in the Great Lakes,
such as walleye and lake trout.
   Mackie says, however, there are some positive aspects to the
zebra mussel invasion. The zebra mussel's filtering ability is
making Lake Erie clearer.
   ``I've never seen Lake Erie look so nice as it has,'' LePage
says. ``I've seen the bottom of the lake in places that I've never
seen before.''
   In the Netherlands and Soviet Union, researchers put the zebra
mussel's filtering ability to use in clarifying lakes. They also
use it as a biological monitor to detect what chemicals are in the
water.
   In the United States and Canada, a new industry has sprouted
around the zebra mussel. Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Mich.,
and many others are developing anti-fouling boat coatings to keep
zebra mussels from attaching. The King Co. in Holland, Mich., has
developed a bullet-shaped squeegee to scrape and remove zebra
mussels from water intake pipes.
   Researchers from around the country are watching Congress to see
whether it appropriates $37.5 million for research and control of
the zebra mussel. Others are refining methods to control the pest.
Most of those solutions are based on chlorine, which is fatal to
the zebra mussel. It's been used for the past 200 years in the
mollusk's native Europe.
   In Monroe, a chlorine spray jet has been installed at the mouth
of the water intake to treat the water as it enters the pipe.
   ``So far we are keeping them down,'' LePage says. ``Our intake
is as clean as a whistle.''
   Monroe used the King Co.'s squeegee to clean its intake pipe
after last year's invasion. The high-tech RotoRooter removed enough
mussels to fill six dump trucks. It cost the city $250,000 to get
the system back to pre-mussel operating levels.
   The water plant sends divers down regularly to inspect the
intake for zebra mussel buildup. The city also is building a second
water intake designed to prevent another zebra mussel takeover. The
modifications will cost the city an extra $2 million, LePage says.
   To control the zebra mussel, Great Lakes researchers are trying
to learn all they can about the mussel's habits - its reproduction,
its predators and parasites, and its favorite nesting spots.
   At a recent meeting of zebra mussel experts from around the
world in Saginaw, Mich., some said the best approach may be to find
ways to control and even anticipate all introduced species, not
just the zebra mussel. Other species recently introduced in the
Great Lakes are upsetting the food chain. They include the spiny
water flea and the ruffe, a fish limited mainly to the Duluth,
Minn., area.
   The scientists proposed forming a center for the study of
introduced species, possibly to be established at a university in
the Great Lakes.
   ``It's going to take years of research before we get a
definitive answer,'' Mackie says.

Members of Congress from Great Lakes states Wednesday introduced legislation to 
curb or eradicate the zebra mussel, a tiny shellfish that has infested Lake 
Erie and threatens to cause damage in other lakes and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The experts seem to think that this can spread very rapidly, just as it has in 
Lake Erie," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a co-sponsor of the measure, which 
would authorize spending $4 million a year for five years for prevention 
programs and the same amount on eradication. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require freighters to dump their ballast water in the 
ocean at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
The striped zebra mussel, usually no more than 1 1/2 inches long, is believed 
to have arrived in North America in 1986, when a freighter from eastern Europe 
flushed its ballast water into Lake St. Clair or in the St. Clair River near 
Detroit. The mussels have since spread down the length of the Detroit River and 
into Lake Erie, moving at about 160 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said that the mussels forced Monroe, Mich., to ration 
water for several days because they had clogged drinking water intake pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 50 other major municipal intake pipes in Michigan, not to mention 
industry users, are at risk from this same type of fouling," Levin said. "They 
threaten the Great Lakes' $4-billion sports fish industry by robbing the fish 
and other aquatic species of essential food sources such as algae and 
plankton." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) warned that the inedible shellfish can easily migrate 
into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems, which "could become 
literally mussel-bound." 
</P>
<P>
A female zebra mussel lays up to 40,000 microscopic eggs in a year. 
</P>
<P>
An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional Research Service 
found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat zebra mussels, but he warned 
that there may not be enough intact wetlands to provide habitat for more of the 
natural predators.

   Could it be that the hated zebra mussel isn't
all bad?
   Soviet scientists apparently think so, says an Environmental
Protection Agency official who is planning to visit Moscow next
month in search of ideas for battling the tiny mollusks.
   Officials are frantically searching for a way to prevent
infestation of the Great Lakes by the pesky mussels, with their
zebra-like stripes.
   Valdas V. Adamkus, the EPA's national program manager for the
Great Lakes, said Wednesday he had received some papers from Soviet
scientists who earlier notified him they had developed a biological
method of attacking the pest.
   Zebra mussels breed rapidly and attach themselves to municipal
water intake pipes.
   Much to his surprise, however, the papers said nothing about
ways to eradicate the mussel, Adamkus said. Instead, they described
the creature as useful because it can help control water pollution.
   ``They proved through their scientific work that zebra mussels
can be a cleansing agent,'' he said. ``So instead of trying to
reduce them, they are actually trying to ... increase their
population.
   ``We were surprised,'' he said. ``We're trying to eliminate the
zebra mussels and they are actually using them as an agent for
purification of water.''
   How the mussels could clean dirty water isn't clear, Adamkus
said. But the report has made him all the more eager to visit the
Soviet Union.
   ``I'm going to call on all the available scientists over there,
meet with them, get any information or whatever scientific work or
literature is available,'' he said.
   Last summer, the mussels clogged the water intake pipe of
Monroe, Mich., restricting the flow through the 6,000-foot pipe by
nearly 24 percent.
   Zebra mussels originated in Eastern Europe's freshwater seas and
are believed to have entered the Great Lakes in the ballast water
of oceangoing vessels.
   They showed up in Lake St. Clair in 1987 and rapidly infested
Lake Erie. They have been spotted from Duluth, Minn., to New York.
   In a related development, the House Appropriations Committee
voted Wednesday to spend $1 million for zebra mussel research at
the Great Lakes Research Laboratory at Ann Arbor.
   Another $3 million for zebra mussel study was reserved, pending
completion of legislation to authorize the Sea Grant program, said
Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a committee member.
   The panel also set aside $1.4 million to combat the sea lamprey,
another Great Lakes pest.

   Small, striped aliens that stowed away on
European freighters are threatening the security of North America's
waterways, warn lawmakers who fear the Great Lakes will become
mussel beaches.
   The rapid spread of the marauding mollusks led legislators
Wednesday to introduce bills aimed at preventing further aquatic
invasions and battling the one underway by the dread zebra mussel.
   Unchecked, the exotic, inedible shellfish could cause $5 billion
in damage by the turn of the century and spread to two-thirds of
the nation's waterways, said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' said Glenn, who was joined at a
news conference by seven lawmakers who want the federal government
to spend $40 million to research and control the barnacle-like
creature.
   ``We don't want to look a few years from now on what we should
have spent this year,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., whose
district is bound by Lake Michigan. That lake so far is mussel-free
except for the bottom of one boat in Green Bay, Wis.
   The mussels, usually no more than 1{ inches long, are believed
to have been carried here from Eastern Europe three years ago in
the ballast water of freighters.
   They've multiplied dramatically because they spawn almost
continuously _ an adult female can produce upwards of 30,000 eggs
in a year _ and because there has been nothing to control the
spread of the alien mussels.
   An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional
Research Service found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat
zebra mussels but warned that there may not be enough intact
wetlands to provide a habitat for more of the natural predators.
   There weren't enough predators to prevent 30 tons of mussels
from clogging a 2{-mile intake pipe at an Ontario water plant or
prevent mussels from accumulating up to two inches thick on screens
of the water intakes at five Cleveland Electric Illumination Co.
power plants.
   Monroe, Mich., was forced to close its water plant for three
days after zebra mussels restricted water flow. Detroit Edison Co.
had to reduce the output of its Monroe, Mich. plant by 25 percent
because one of its pipes became coated with the mussels.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said a $29 million breakwall that
took a decade to get for Presque Isle in Lake Erie is being
jeopardized by zebra mussels.
   And Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., warned that the shellfish can easily
migrate into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems,
which ``could become literally mussel-bound.''
   And there's more. Dead zebra mussels can produce ``offensive
quantities of methane gas,'' according to the congressional
research report. When they die in the pipes of water treatment
systems they can give the water a foul taste and smell. Once they
wash ashore, the mussels' sharp shells can rip up the bare feet of
beach walkers.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the mussels already endanger
the fisheries of Lake Erie by stripping the lake of microscopic
feeder plants.
   When the bottom of the aquatic food chain collapses, ``the net
result is there will be no little baby fish left in Lake Erie to
grow up to be big fish,'' said Eckart, who added he's worried about
the impact on a newly revived sportfishing and recreation economy.
   ``It's another one of those unwanted foreign imports that's
costing us jobs,'' he said.
   The bills introduced by Glenn in the Senate and Rep. Henry
Nowak, D-N.Y., in the House would authorize spending $4 million a
year for five years to control the mussels and the same amount on
prevention programs to protect U.S. waters from other foreign
invaders.
   In addition, the bills require freighters to dump their ballast
water in the ocean, at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast.

<TEXT>
   The zebra mussel, a fast-breeding type of
shellfish that clogs the intake pipes of power plants, has been
found in the Hudson River for the first time, scientists said.
   The mussels, which had not been seen east of the central section
of the Erie Canal, were found off Croton Point in Westchester
County, New York City's northern suburbs. It was identified
Wednesday by experts at the New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport.
   ``It is the first confirmed North American sighting of the
mussel outside of the Great Lakes drainage basin,'' Charles O'Neill
Jr., a supervisor at the clearinghouse, told The New York Times in
a story published today.
   O'Neill noted that the zebra mussel, classified as a freshwater
animal, is not usually found in saltwater like the lower Hudson.
   ``It raises a lot of questions that we don't have answers for,''
he said.
   The zebra mussel, a native of Europe, was first found in the
United States in 1988 in Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit.
   Named for its dark brown stripes on a tan shell, the mussel
breeds quickly and can clog the intake pipes of power plants and
eats microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for
freshwater fish.
   In areas where the mussels have taken hold, utilities have
fought back by flushing pipes with treated water, cleaning intake
screens by hand and using chlorine and other chemicals to kill
them.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that the
expanding population of the mussels could add $500 million a year
in added costs for utilities, water companies and factories and
loss of business in sports fishing, marinas and motels along inland
waterways.

   Wilfred LePage saw his first zebra mussel Feb. 1. By September,
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water
treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly
sparking a water emergency.
   ``There is no cheap solution to it and there's no real cure to
the problem,'' said LePage, water treatment superintendent in
Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie's western edge.
   At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the
green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now
infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December's
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they
quickly settled inside the plant.
   ``They like it where it's dimly lit, they like it where it's
warm, and they don't like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal
for them,'' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at
the plant. ``By July, we're going to have a massive problem with
them.''
   Three years after they were introduced to North America and
after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake
Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It's an invasion
scientists say could affect farming, fishing and daily life along
virtually every body of fresh water in North America in the next
few years.
   The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can
reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by
filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings
them a steady supply of fresh food.
   A mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour, said R.
Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State
University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave water
cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would
certainly be a benefit, I guess,'' he said.
   Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds,
and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said
Charles O'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University
College at Brockport.
   The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and
some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But
with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they
could deplete the supply for the small fish that support the
billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry.
   And the bad news could spread beyond the lake and its shoreline.
Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation water from the lakes
can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because
of the shells, O'Neill said.
   ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet
to the water at your tap,'' O'Neill said. ``It's not just an
environmental problem.''
   Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in
theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian
researchers tried steaming a bunch, O'Neill said, ``What they got
was a stench that cleared the lab.''
   The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are
believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that
emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake
Erie, in 1986.
   Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie
infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986
event, O'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested
the lake because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year
and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells.
``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that
period of time,'' he said.
   For public water systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of
applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the
intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the
plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have
already faced the problem.
   Power plants have a different problem, because officials are
reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in
cooling water discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara
Mohawk and the state Department of Environmental Conservation are
negotiating a solution.
   James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk water plant, is
studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe's mouth, like
building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine
pipe out through the intake. ``We're better off than the people in
the western end of the lake,'' Sell said.
   ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.''
   The City Council hasn't been persuaded to pay up to $100,000 for
the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to
show visitors, said, ``I don't see much option for them if they
want a water supply.''
   Farther inland, many water officials are unaware of the problem
or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of
the state Health Department's bureau of public water supply
protection, said the department was studying the problem but
doesn't see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word's
getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in
the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of
that sort.''
   O'Neill and other scientists said the state should do more to
get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not
necessarily very much time.
   ``The chances of them getting into the western reach of the Erie
Canal is good,'' O'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for
them to live. It's warm. It's shallow. Most of it has rock riprap
to attach to.''
   Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their
engine housings and other places where water collects.
   Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost
certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi
River basin, O'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is
utilizing surface water should be concerned.''

   NEW YORK -- A subsidiary of Coltec Industries Inc. says it
has a better way to combat the zebra mussel, the
fast-breeding mollusk pest that is clogging up America's
water pipes.
   Garlick Valves &amp; Industrial Plastics, a Camden, N.J., unit
of New York-based Coltec, said it has produced a plastic pipe
material in which a mollusk-killing chemical is embedded. The
chemically treated pipe keeps the mussels out of their
favorite breeding places -- water intake pipes, valves and
debris gates -- where they create problems for water
authorities and power generation plants.

   Utility officials pointed out that many companies have
been touting products and services with varying degrees of
effectiveness against the persistent pest.
   The zebra mussel, native to Europe, was discovered in the
Great Lakes in the 1980s; biologists believe they arrived in
the ballast of European freighters that moved in the lakes.
The mussel grows to about thumbnail-size, and breeds
profusely, up to concentrations of nearly a million per
square meter of surface. It causes havoc by clogging water
intake pipes of boats, factories, public water facilities and
irrigation systems. Various estimates of the cost of cleanup
and control of the zebra mussel over the next several years
run in the billions of dollars.
   Adam Patarcity, operations manager for Garlick Valves,
said the product, called Z-Gard, is a version of its
ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene to which a
molluscicide is added. The current slick-surfaced
polyethylene hasn't prevented the zebra mussels from
attaching, but the new plastic has been very effective, after
tests at 11 sites in Great Lakes, he said.
   The worst areas of infestation in the U.S. are Lake Erie,
particularly the southern shore around Cleveland, and Lake
Huron and the Detroit area. Removal of the mussels currently
must be done mechanically, by scraping or blasting with
high-pressure water, or by chemical treatment of the water.
Mr. Patarcity said that unlike previous efforts to control
the mussels, the chemical in its new pipe material won't
leach out into the water and threaten the environment.
   Z-Gard joins a growing list of ostensible mussel-stoppers,
and its potential market has a wait-and-see attitude. "Every
day we have people calling to offer a silver bullet" for the
problem, said William Kovalak, a biologist for Detroit Edison
Co. "So we take more of a passive stance. We let them come in
and put their product in the water, and if it works, we can
use it without having invested much." He said some
silicone-based chemical coatings for intake areas seem to
work well, adding that Detroit Edison facilities on lakes
Erie and Huron have some of the worst mussel concentrations
in the U.S.

   Wilfred LePage saw his first zebra mussel Feb. 1. By September,
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water
treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly
sparking a water emergency.
   ``There is no cheap solution to it and there's no real cure to
the problem,'' said LePage, water treatment superintendent in
Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie's western edge.
   At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the
green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now
infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December's
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they
quickly settled inside the plant.
   ``They like it where it's dimly lit, they like it where it's
warm, and they don't like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal
for them,'' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at
the plant. ``By July, we're going to have a massive problem with
them.''
   Three years after they were introduced to North America and
after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake
Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It's an invasion
scientists say could affect farming, fishing and daily life along
virtually every body of fresh water in North America in the next
few years.
   The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can
reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by
filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings
them a steady supply of fresh food.
   A mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour, said R.
Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State
University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave water
cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would
certainly be a benefit, I guess,'' he said.

and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said

<HEAD>Zebra Mussel Infestation of Great Lakes Could Be Costly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zebra mussels accidentally imported to
the Great Lakes in the last four years are threatening commercial
and sport fishing and forcing cities and industries into costly
measures to protect water supplies.
   The 2-inch-long mollusk, first dropped off an ocean-going
freighter in Lake St. Clair outside Detroit, has spread through
Lake Erie and a colony was found in Lake Michigan near Green Bay,
Wis., said Michael Donahue, executive director of the Great Lakes
Commission, headquartered in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Intake pipes for industrial plants and municipal water systems
are among favorite breeding grounds for the greenish-striped
mussel. Monroe, Mich., just south of Detroit, is designing a system
to bathe the mouth of its intake system with ozone-infused water in
hopes of killing the mussels' larvae, but there is very little that
apparently can be done to stem the surge of the mussels.
   Cleveland is also facing heavy bills to rid itself of an
infestation, and Detroit has been forced to partially close its
water plant.
   ``I will guarantee you that it may be Detroit and Cleveland's
problem today, but it is going to be Gary's and Michigan City's
problem in the near future,'' Donahue said. ``There's just no way
to stop it.''
   In addition, the mussels feed voraciously on algae that other
fish and mollusks need, and could devastate Lake Erie's walleye
pike _ one of the lake's most important commercial fish, by
covering spawning grounds, said Jon Stanley, of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Ann Arbor.
   ``Those actions in Lake Erie, we expect, will reduce the walleye
population by about half,'' Stanley said. A ``good portion'' of the
estimated $600 million a year in Lake Erie fisheries comes from
walleye.
   Beaches also could become fouled by the sharp-edged mussel
shells, Stanley said. ``You can notice the difference on some
beaches already. They used to be nice soft sand, but now they
crunch underfoot as you walk.''

<HEAD>Researchers Use Dogs to Test Radon Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty dogs will have radon
detectors attached to their collars as part of a study into the
effects of the odorless gas.
   ``We hope to find an association between radon exposure and lung
cancer in dogs and, therefore, in humans,'' said Purdue University
veterinarian Robert Teclaw. ``The long-term goal is to find out if
dogs can serve as warning signals on environmental hazards to
humans.''
   Dogs were chosen because they are in the house as much or more
than people, who work outside the home, and because they have a
shorter lifespan. Any health hazards from radon will show up
earlier in the animals than in humans.
   Dog owners in Tippecanoe County, where Purdue is located, this
month began fitting their pets with the collars, which will be worn
for three months. The detectors weigh less than an ounce and are
the size of a silver dollar. Film inside the detector is sensitive
to ions emitted by radon. Radon coming in contact with the film
will leave tell-tale tracks.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that comes
predominantly from the decay of radium, which occurs naturally in
the soil and can accumulate in a house. Exposure over a long period
of time has been associated with lung cancer and other health risks.
   The owners also will be asked to keep diaries of where the dogs
spent their time and how long they were in each area of the house.
The radon level in the house will be measured separately.

<HEAD>Spread of Zebra Mussels Inland Feared After Lake Superior
Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say the zebra mussel will spread
to inland waters following the first confirmed sightings in Lake
Superior.
   ``This isn't going to just affect anglers,'' said Dennis Pratt,
western Lake Superior fisheries manager for the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources. ``This one's going to affect
industry, boaters ... and the ecosystem is going to take it on the
chin.''
   Discovery in March of the mussel in the Twin Ports of Duluth and
Superior, Wis., proves the pest is established in all the Great
Lakes, scientists say.
   The invader brought via the St. Lawrence Seaway in the ballast
of European freighters was found last month on eight of 26 St.
Louis River buoys inspected.
   Experts say the half-inch, barnacle-like shellfish multiply so
fast that colonies of millions may turn up soon. They can clog
water valves, foul city water systems and pollute beaches.
   ``They have a two-year reproductive cycle. I think you'll start
seeing them next year in big numbers,'' Pratt said. And once
they're here, there's almost nothing that can be done to stop them,
Pratt said.
   Zebra mussels have caused millions of dollars in damage in Lake
Erie and Lake St. Clair. Great Lakes environmental officials say
virtually all the hard surfaces in the two lakes are covered with
zebra mussel beds at least an inch thick.
   The creatures also have accumulated two inches thick and clogged
water intakes at five Cleveland Electric Illumination Co. power
plants. Monroe, Mich., was forced to close its water plant for
three days when zebra mussels were so thick on intake pipes they
slowed water flow.
   Dead zebra mussels can give off offensive quantities of methane
gas and foul city water supplies.
   Environmentally, it's feared huge colonies of zebra mussels on
rocks and shoals will disrupt fish spawning, especially walleye and
lake trout. They also are believed to increase the spread of
parasites damaging to fish and waterfowl.
   A bill moving through Congress asks for $40 million to help
combat the mussels. The mussels' total economic damage in the Great
Lakes could hit $5 billion by the turn of the century, a
congressional study said.
   The mussels apparently have few natural enemies, and it is
unlikely they'll be food for humans because they're so small and
carry parasites.
   Scientists on the lower Great Lakes are experimenting with
ultrasound vibrations to keep the mussels away. Chlorination also
seems to help, as does electric shock and speeding the water flow.

<HEAD>Chemists' Laboratory-Created Molecule Makes, Stores Energy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona State University scientists said
they have have created a molecule which converts light into energy
almost as efficiently as the natural process of photosynthesis and
stores it the way a battery would.
   The development one day could lead to new methods of harvesting
solar energy, the chemists said.
   ``Nobody's going to put the kind of devices we're making now on
their roof and start harvesting energy,'' said Devens Gust, a
leader of the team from the university's Photosynthesis Research
Center.
   He said silicon solar cells already in use were much more
practical for such purposes, but the microscopic ASU device may be
suited to drive chemical reactions.
   The researchers published the details of their work in the April
13 issue of the journal Science.
   Gust said the researchers call the device a ``pentad molecule''
because of its five active parts. A critical factor in its success
is its ability to change light into electrically charged chemicals
and store the energy, he said.
   He said the molecule does that by separating the positively and
negatively charged parts of atoms and holding them about
one-billionth of a centimeter apart at opposite ends of the
ladder-like molecule.
   The synthetic molecule can capture and store 83 percent as much
energy as its natural counterparts, Gust said.
   Mark Wrighton, chairman of the chemistry department at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said efficient molecular
electronic components could radically increase the speed and
capability of computers.
   Gust said one problem with using the molecule in consumer
electronics is its size.
   ``The traditional approach to electronics really has been a
materials approach,'' Gust said. ``You start out with something
such as bulk silicon. Then you devise ways to make devices from
that bulk silicon that are smaller and smaller.''
   Using the molecular-electronics approach, he said, ``You design
the device at the molecular level. Then you try to figure out ways
to incorporate these molecular-sized devices into large,
macroscopic electronic circuits.''
   Such applications may be years away, Gust said.

<HEAD>European Mollusks Invading Great Lakes Are Here To Stay</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By JEFFREY ULBRICH&equals;
Associated Press Writer&equals;
   TORONTO (AP) _ A small European freshwater mollusk called the
zebra mussel has spread at an alarming rate since it was found in
the Great Lakes in 1988, threatening the ecosystem and clogging up
industry.
   Experts say there is no way to wipe the mussels out.
   ``In the Great Lakes, all we can do is accept the fact that they
are here and learn to live with it,'' said Gerry Mackie, a biology
professor at the University of Guelph who specializes in freshwater
bivalves.
   Criticism in Canada focuses on the government's slowness in
attacking the problem.
   ``The invasion of the zebra mussels was preventable,'' the
Toronto Globe and Mail said in an editorial. ``Canada's complacency
let it happen, and may enable similar invasions unless the country
takes strong preventive measures.''
   Joe Comuzzi, a Liberal member of Parliament, complained recently
that Ottawa had committed only $230,000 ($195,500 U.S.) to the
problem. He said that ``doesn't even pay for the paper to write a
report.''
   The mussel invasion has been expensive for Ontario Hydro, which
has power plants along the lake shore.
   Zebra mussels produce a sticky thread that attaches them to
solid objects _ water pipes in Ontario Hydro's case. The mussels
are capable of sticking in such numbers that they stop or greatly
reduce the flow of water.
   Large intake pipes are not affected, but the mussels swim up
into the small-diameter service piping inside the plants.
   Their presence also leads to corrosion.
   ``It has cost us well over $6 million to retrofit all of the
stations for this year, and it's costing us lots in research,''
said Renata Claudi, a senior scientist with the utility company.
   Representatives of 13 companies in the Chemical Valley of
Sarnia, Ontario, got together this month to work out a common
strategy against the mollusks.
   The zebra mussel, about 1{ inches in diameter, is a
dark-colored, clam-like creature with white stripes.
   It has a larval stage of about a month when it swims with the
currents. That accounts for much of its rapid spread throug the
Great Lakes.
   Some of the mollusks hitch rides on ships up the lakes through
Huron, Michigan and Superior and others swim down the current into
the St. Lawrence Seaway.
   A female produces 30,000 to 40,000 eggs in each of its two or
three years of life.
   Experts agree zebra mussels entered the Great Lakes system in
Lake St. Clair in the summer of 1985 or 1986. They probably were
flushed from the ballast of a ship that came from Europe.
   All the Great Lakes now are infested and scientists say their
passage into the Mississippi River system is inevitable.
   ``They have gone through the Niagara River and into Lake
Ontario,'' Ms. Claudi said. ``Now they are swimming their way
toward Toronto.''
   Scientists are not sure what the ecological impact will be, but
are fearful of it.
   ``You have to keep it in perspective,'' said Joe Leach, a
research scientist with the Ontario Natural Resources Ministry.
``The major impacts right now are with the technical devices, pipes
and so on. We ... are looking at potention impacts on ... fishes,
but at the present time there is no indication of major ecological
impact.''
   Leach said the main fears were disruption of spawning for fish
like walleye, which lay their eggs on hard, rocky areas, and that
the food chain would be altered.
   ``These things are filter feeders,'' he said. ``They filter an
enormous amount of water and take everything out of it. What they
don't use, they put mucus around and drop it down to the bottom.''
   That shifts a lot of organic matter from the water to the bottom
of the lake. Leach said it eventually could change fish populations
by reducing the number of water column feeders, such as walleye and
trout, and increasing catfish, sturgeon and other bottom feeders.
   There also is increasing evidence of zebra mussels attaching to
other bivalves and smothering them.
   ``As it stands now, there isn't anything you can do,'' Leach
said. ``There is no way you can control them. If you use poison,
you are going to poison the system.''
   Ontario Hydro uses chlorine, the most effective molluscicide
found so far.
   In one affected plant, Ms. Claudi said, the company ``applied
sodium hypochlorite in relatively small doses for about two weeks.
That basically did them in and all we had to worry about was
cleaning out the shells.''
   She added that the amount used, in an agreement with the
Environment Ministry, ``is never more than 10 parts per billion.
Compare that with the five parts per million of the same stuff in
the drinking water we happily drink every day.''
   Ms. Claudi says Ontario Hydro was talking to other utilities
across the lakes, the American Waterworks Association and Electric
Power Research Association, ``but we're finding that we are way
ahead or at the same level as these guys'' in research.
   Most experts believe the zebra mussel population eventually will
level off and perhaps even decline, but Mackie said the problem was
``trying to determine at what point they will level off or if they
will crash.''
   Geoff Holland of the federal fisheries and oceans department
said Canadian officials probably would meet with provincial and
U.S. representatives this fall to work out a budget for fighting
the zebra mussel.
   As for Ontario Hydro, Ms. Claudi said: ``Prevention is really
what we're looking at. We just don't want those guys in our pipe.''

<HEAD>Discovery Of Zebra Mussels In Hudson River Startles Scientists</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) - The discovery of zebra mussels in
the brackish waters of the Hudson River startled scientists, who
said Thursday the pests weren't supposed to get this far south this
soon.
   ``We've just thrown the book out now,'' Avery Klauber, a
spokesman for New York Sea Grant at the State University of New
York in Stony Brook. ``There's no way of knowing how far and how
fast they're going to travel.''
   Experts didn't expect the tiny mussel, named for its striped
shell, to appear in the Hudson until next year or the year after.
Scientists also had hoped the waters of the lower Hudson, with a
salinity of eight parts per thousand, would be too salty for the
mussels.
   They have been spreading through the Great Lakes since 1988,
when scientists think European ships released them with ballast
water.
   The mussels have few natural predators and breed rapidly,
causing problems for industries, power plants, public water systems
and boaters by clogging water intakes. They can also wreak havoc on
aquatic food chains.
   Federal officials have estimated that control of the mussels
could cost as much as $5 billion over the next decade in the Great
Lakes region.
   The Hudson River discovery is the first North American sighting
of the pest outside the Great Lakes drainage basin, said Charles
O'Neill, supervisor of the New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport.
   ``Everybody was watching to see where they'd turn up out of the
Great Lakes,'' O'Neill said. ``This one being such a jump opens up
the possibility that the mussels can be really widely scattered.''
   The animals were discovered by accident on a piece of wood
collected for an museum exhibit from Haverstraw Bay, about 25 miles
north of New York City, O'Neill said, adding it was too early to
tell the extent of the infestation.
   He said the mussels may have been brought to the river by a
Great Lakes pleasure boat or a European ship, or even by a piece of
wood floating from the Erie Canal to the Mohawk River and on into
the Hudson.
   The discovery of the mussels is particularly worrisome to
officials of four major power plants near the discovery site,
O'Neill said.
   Experts expect zebra mussels eventually to find their way into
the Mississippi River through canals connecting it to the Great
Lakes. From there, they could spread across the United States.
   ``We're looking at a critter that within the next couple
generations could very possibly be found throughout North
America,'' O'Neill said.
   In Washington, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., issued a plea to
President Bush Thursday to sign legislation authorizing $60 million
for project grants and research funding to control the mussels.

   The zebra mussel is one of many exotic species
invading U.S. waters, and a broad strategy is needed to keep them
from wreaking economic and environmental havoc, experts said
Tuesday.
   The river ruffe, spiny water flea and tube-nosed goby soon may
become as familiar to the Great Lakes as the zebra mussel,
witnesses said at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on
Environmental Protection.
   Meanwhile, the asiatic clam, Japanese seaweed and the red tide
are damaging shellfish and marine industries along the ocean coasts.
   The newcomers threaten many native species, interrupt the food
chain and pose a danger to the U.S. fishing industry and other
segments of the economy, said Gillman D. Veith, director of the
Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and
Development.
   ``Given the rate of technological change and movement of people,
it is likely that the problems resulting from invasions of
non-native species will increase,'' said Veith.
   The city of Monroe, Mich., was forced to ration water for
several days and spend $500,000 removing zebra mussels from its
water intake pipe last year, said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. Shipping,
tourism, paper production and other industries could be affected if
such problems become widespread, he said.
   ``There is growing concern that the introduction of
non-indigenous species by ships, particularly through their ballast
water, has affected the ecosystems and economies of countries
around the world,'' said Capt. Thomas E. Thompson of the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Bills pending in the House and Senate would order the Coast
Guard to develop and enforce regulations on dumping of ships'
ballast water _ the suspected source of zebra mussels, which are
native to fresh-water bodies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The tiny bivalves with zebra-like stripes have spread with
lightning speed through the Great Lakes since their arrival in
1986. They fasten themselves to hard surfaces, such as pipes and
boat hulls, and ingest plankton essential to the aquatic food chain.
   Senators from the region urged quick action and braodening the
scopes of the bills to deal with other natural invaders.

<HEAD>Senate Adds $20 Million to Farm Bill to Stop Zebra Mussel Spread</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate has approved a $20 million research
and prevention program to keep zebra mussels from invading farm
irrigation systems.
   The striped mollusk, which is not native to North America, has
caused problems at water and power plants throughout the Great
Lakes. They attach to water intake pipes and clog them.
   An amendment authorizing the $20 million over five years was
added to the 1990 farm bill by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``Unlike other infestations, this one is irreversible,''
Moynihan said in a statement Thursday. ``The zebra mussel is here
to stay ... Within 20 years' time it will have spread through the
entire surface water system of North America.''
   The amendment, which the Senate passed late Wednesday, directs
the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to develop a program of research, prevention and design criteria
for irrigation systems with an emphasis on keeping the mussels out.
   On Wednesday, scientists expressed surprise that the tiny
mollusks are spreading through the Erie Canal system from Buffalo,
N.Y., and now threaten Rochester, N.Y. and the Finger Lakes region.
   ``Frankly, I did not think their advance would be this fast,''
said Cameron Lange, a biologist studying the mussels' movement for
a consortium of power companies.
   ``I thought we might find a few at Lockport during our late July
sample but I did not think they'd reach Rochester by now.''
   Rochester is about 60 miles east of Lockport, N.Y.
   In May, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
authorized $37.5 million in grants and research funding for control
of the mussel. The provision is part of the pending Water Resources
Development Act of 1990.

<LEADPARA>  Fast-breeding zebra mussels are spreading quicker and causing more damage to
Lake Michigan factories, utilities and boats far sooner than had been
predicted, according to Chicago-area experts. Massive infestations of the
gray- and white-striped, fingernail-size mollusks along Lake Michigan caused a
steel mill to reduce operations by more than half when they clogged a key
water intake, and some boaters are reporting mussels crippling their engines.;
  In the year since the European species was found near Chicago, it has spread
along the Illinois and Indiana lake shore and north into Wisconsin and
traveled 300 miles by water to the Mississippi River.  </LEADPARA>

<LEADPARA>  Engineers and biologists say the zebra mussel -- a sticky, prolific little
troublemaker -- will soon invade the Ohio River and its tributaries.
Discovered in U.S. waters only five years ago, the tiny shelled animal
attaches itself to boat hulls, docks and water intakes and outlets and is "a
difficult creature for water utilities to handle," said Dennis Willaman,
general manager of the Kenton County Water District in Covington, Ky. In the
past, the mussels have clogged pipes in various municipal water systems.
Scientists think the mussel, once found only in Europe, hitched a ride in the
ballast water of a U.S.-bound vessel. The ship discharged its water into the
Great Lakes, where the transplanted mollusks flourished. Experts say the
mussel has no known predators other than a few species of ducks.  </LEADPARA>

<HEAD>Tiny Foreigner Invades Great Lakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yet another foreign invader has ignored the
border and taken up residence in the Great Lakes.
   A tube-nosed goby, a 3-inch-long fish from the Black Sea region
of the Soviet Union, was recently found on an intake screen at the
Detroit Edison Co.'s Belle River plant on the St. Clair River.
   But the goby doesn't appear threatening, unlike a host of other
invaders, including the water pipe-clogging zebra mussel, the
trout-killing sea lamprey, and the beach-befouling alewife.
   Like other non-native critters, the goby probably got to the
Great Lakes by hitching a ride on ocean freighters which take on
water _ and any small free-swimming animals that happen to be in
the way _ for ballast. When the ship reaches port on the Great
Lakes to take on cargo, the ballast gets dumped.
   Threatening or no, the goby isn't welcome.
   Biologists ``don't like to see foreign species end up in our
bodies of water,'' said Dave Jude, the University of Michigan
scientist who found the fish.

<TEXT>     Now, thanks to the latest National Geographic TV special, "Great Lakes,
Fragile Seas" (Wednesday, 8 p.m., Ch. 9), we can learn a lot more about the
lakes and the imposing challenges that threaten their long-term survival.;   
This excellent hour documentary, written, produced and photographed by Joe
Seamans, contains some facts that may amaze most of us, including:;    (box) 
The five lakes -- Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior -- hold at least
six quadrillion gallons of water, enough to flood all 48 contiguous states to
a depth of 10 feet.;    (box)  The largest lakes are so huge that they
frequently have stormy "seas" that rival those found in the world's oceans.;  
 (box)  More than 10,000 vessels have sunk while crossing the Great Lakes.;   
(box)  The flow in the lakes is so complex that it may take nearly 100 years
for toxic chemicals to completely wash out of their waters.;    (box)  The
lakes contain about 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.;   
Scooped out by glacial action about 20,000 years ago, the Great Lakes face
several simultaneous ecological crises brought about by humans' intense use of
their waters in just the past 200 years.;    Seamans' camera shows us deformed
fish and birds, genetically damaged by toxic chemicals still present in the
waters despite heroic efforts to clean them up after a 1972 pact between the
U.S. and Canadian governments.;    We also see what amounts to "biological
pollution" from the destructive Zebra mussels, now multiplying rapidly in the
lakes and destroying the natural food chain by siphoning off up to 50 percent
of all nutrients needed by native lake species.;    Experts studying the
problem believe that the mussels, native to the Caspian and Black seas, were
carried into the lakes by seagoing foreign vessels. If Americans and Canadians
hadn't built a complex system of locks and waterways, linking the lakes to the
Atlantic, these marauders never would have turned up.;     Diversity of life; 
Originally, lakes Ontario and Erie were linked only by the Niagara River. The
spectacular Niagara Falls served as a natural barrier to invasion of outside
species. But the human-made bypass of the falls opened the doorway to what may
be ecological disaster.;    Seamans' far-ranging film aptly demonstrates the
diversity of life on the lakes, beyond the skyscraper-lined cities along their
shores. For example, we visit remote Madeline Island on Lake Superior, which
is reached only by "wind sleds" during the icy winters, and a Chippewa Indian
community, where wild rice is harvested in preserved wetlands the same way it
was 200 years ago.;    Wreckage explored; In what may be the film's most
bizarre excursion, we probe the depths of Lake Superior by robot mini-sub to
explore the wreckage of the 729-foot steel freighter Edmund Fitzgerald, which
split in half and sank during a tremendous storm in 1975.;    Though "Great
Lakes, Fragile Seas" does include some sobering information, it's not a
downer. Progress is being made in halting the environmental threats to the
lakes. They're even pulling big, beautiful, edible fish from the same waters
that once caught fire; so it seems there is cause for cautious optimism after
all. (box)  </TEXT>

   Some people never throw anything
away, according to Scott Bruce, who came to this breakfast food
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection.
   Sound flaky?
   ``Cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture _ the grain
gods, I call them,'' said Bruce, a Cambridge, Mass., collector who
once started a lunch-box collecting craze.
   ``When a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal, he
becomes one with his hero. It's like a secular communion rite.''
   Bruce, 34, is talking this week with cereal company executives
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes, if there is such
a thing.
   Rare boxes can fetch up to $1,000, said Bruce, who began his
collection in 1988 and recently published a collector's magazine
called Flake.
   Battle Creek is the home of Kellogg Co., the world's largest
cereal maker, as well as Post and Ralston-Purina plants.
   ``The people here have cereal in their bloodstream,'' said Bruce.
   Old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around.
   ``The militant mom was the death to many collections,'' he said
mournfully. ``But maybe I'll find that that odd citizen who has a
Corn Flakes box with Vanessa Williams.'' Miss Williams, Miss
America 1984, lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed
nude for Playboy.
   Bruce said he generally hunts for vintage boxes in good
condition from the 1930s through 1970s. But he's even squirreling
away some of today's boxes.
   ``The 1990 Batman cereal box from Ralston is an instant
classic,'' he said. ``Just you wait.''

   A marina owner has discovered a use for
the pesky zebra mussels clogging water intake lines along Lake Erie.
   Kent Floro makes the mussels into jewelry.
   ``Business has been going quite well,'' said Floro, owner of
Floro's Marina and a convenience store. ``It's kind of like your

   Floro said he collects the basic raw material from the shore by
his marina. Completed mussel earrings, necklaces, tie clips and hat
pins cost between $3 and $4.
   ``We aren't going to run out of stock,'' Floro said, pointing
out that a mussel can produce 30,000 larvae a year.
   The tiny shellfish, less than an inch long, have been clogging
water intake lines from the lake since 1988.

   A Canadian delivery of sleet and ice sledded into the deep South
on Monday in a winter preview that cracked century-old temperature
records across the Midwest and clogged the Missouri River with a
75-mile ice jam.
   The bitter weather closed schools from Mississippi to Michigan,
and forecasters said no change was in sight. The cold is being
caused by a horseshoe-shaped flow of air that follows the West
Coast up to Alaska, chills out and plunges down through Canada into
the East and Midwest.
   ``It's simply a pipeline that carries ... the cold air
southward,'' said Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the federal
government's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City. ``And by
southward, I mean all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.''
   Southerners from central Mississippi to the Carolinas awoke
Monday to a Yankee's vista of freezing rain and sleet that made
driving hazardous and was blamed for at least one traffic death.
Hundreds of schools were closed.
   The National Weather Service said as much as an inch of sleet
and freezing rain covered north and central Georgia before dawn,
and freezing rain extended as far south as Savannah.
   Ice on Interstate 85 near Atlanta apparently contributed to a
crash that killed Atlanta Falcons tight end Brad Beckman,
authorities said.
   At least 19 deaths around the nation were blamed on the cold
during the weekend, including the deaths of two young Tulsa, Okla.,
girls who apparently were playing with a makeshift sled Sunday when
they plunged through thin ice on a lake. Two homeless people died
of hypothermia while sleeping in New York City subway stations.
   One weekend hypothermia death in Chicago brought to 10 the
number of people who have died from exposure in the municipal area
so far this winter, said a spokeswoman for the Cook County Medical
Examiner's office.
   A school bus carrying 43 children crashed into a station wagon
on a slippery highway Monday near Shapleighl, Maine, but none of
the children were seriously hurt, officials said.
   Monday's cold broke Dec. 18 records that had held for more than
a century in Columbus, Ohio, where it was minus 7; in Pittsburgh,
where it also was 7 below, and in Detroit, where it was minus 3.
   Other records included Parkersburg, W.Va., at 4 above,
Cincinnati at 3 below, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Cleveland at minus 5,
and Youngstown, Ohio, at minus 8.
   ``Good night, it's been unreal,'' said Pam Decker, co-owner of
Decker's Wrecker Service in Boonville, Ind., which was besieged
with calls about stalled and wrecked cars and the need to
jump-start dead or dying car batteries.
   The Missouri River turned to ice for about a 75-mile stretch
between Blair, Neb., just north of Omaha, and Sioux City, Iowa,
according to the National Weather Service.
   The ice jam had begun late Friday and grew over the weekend.
Officials feared that the ice floe could cause problems for
communities that pump their water from the river, and Weather
Service hydrologist Roy Osugi didn't hold out hope for an early
thaw.
   ``Nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather,'' Osugi
said. ``We think it's going to stay in place at least this week
because it's going to stay very cold.''
   In St. Joseph, Mo., officials activated a new emergency pump as
a precautionary measure to keep water flowing to the city.
   There were similar problems in the town of Monroe, Mich., where
55,000 water customers were asked to conserve while workers Monday
cleared a frozen intake valve that also was clogged with Lake Erie
zebra mussels, a non-native species which has no natural predators
and is proliferating in the lake.
   In Crooksville, Ohio, officials declared a water emergency after
a series of water main breaks over the weekend. Parts of the small
town had been without service for three days.
   The cold also was the likely cause of a break in a 4-inch pipe
that let water surge through all 12 floors of a new hospital at
Ohio State University in Columbus, causing at least $1 million
damage and delaying its scheduled Jan. 16 opening, said OSU vice
president Richard Jackson.
   Farther west, the arctic weather system carried welcome snow to
Rocky Mountain ski resorts and wind chills of 35 below zero to
parts of Wyoming. It was 26 below at Jordan, Mont., and high
temperatures in some parts of Montana were expected to be below
zero.
   In Colorado, snowfall in the 24 hours that ended Monday morning
included 4 inches at Denver, 16 inches at Vail and 9\ inches at
Steamboat Springs _ which has gotten 99 inches in nine days, said
spokeswoman Barb Jennings.
   At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, spokesman Norm
Avery said crews were out before daybreak, clearing 10 runways.
However, he said flights were delayed up to an hour because of the
snow.
   Ferguson, of the Severe Storms Forecast Center, said the outlook
for most of the country is for below-average temperatures for the
next month or so.
   ``There's no promise that we can see in any of our projections
that we're going to have balmy weather in the middle of winter,''
he said.

<HEAD>Commission Urges U.S. and Canada to Bar New Species</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An international commission urged the United
States and Canada on Thursday to bar new species of animals from the
Great Lakes in an effort to prevent additional harm to the region's
delicate ecology.
   ``The integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem requires the
maintenance of a balanced yet dynamic natural system,'' the
International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency, said in a
report on the lakes' environment.
   ``Introduced species can seriously affect the balance and
distribution of native species by altering the structure and
developmental patterns of their biological communities,'' it added.
   The report by the commission noted that there have been
continuing concerns about outside species in the lakes, the sea
lamprey and smelt in particular.
   However, in recent years, the number of alien species introduced
into the lakes has shown a significant increase.
   Among the outside species that now threaten the lakes' native
life forms are the alewife, the coho salmon, the Asiatic clam, the
zebra mussel and the river ruffe.
   The commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of the
United States and Canada in controlling the problem, and recommended
that the nations ``take steps to prevent the further introduction,
particularly the unplanned introduction, of exotic life forms into
the Great Lakes ecosystem.''
   It was the first time the commission had made such a
recommendation, said Frank Bevacqua of the commission's Washington
office.
   Some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing.
Others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships or
through extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakes
region.
   Although the new species are controlled by predators in their
original homes, many lack predators in the lakes, ``and given an
adequate food supply and appropriate life-support systems, ... they
can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable
native species,'' the commission said.
   The report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxic
substances in Great Lakes animals, a reversal of declines recorded
in the 1970s.
   Waterbirds on the lakes, however, were producing more offspring,
the commission said.
   ``Populations that were once declining have increased
substantially, and reproductive problems in fish-eating birds are
generally confined to specific sites,'' the report said.
``Similarly, increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reported
in the basin.''
   The report gave no figures on increased toxic-substance
concentration or bird reproduction.

   Liz Taylor, Roberto Duran and a pack of
marauding mussels all came to Congress this past week, in one form
or another.
   If you thought your representatives spent all week on such
weighty matters as aid for Eastern Europe and the Clean Air bill,
think again.
   Most members of Congress devote only a small portion of their
days to such pursuits. Just as many hours, and usually many more,
are spent on keeping constituents happy, getting one's picture or
name mentioned in the hometown or national press, attending
receptions, and lavishing praise on colleagues and witnesses.
   A typical two-hour congressional hearing, for example, will
devote 20 minutes or so to rituals of accolade. The Democratic
chairman of the committee praises a colleague for helping prepare
the session; the ranking Republican praises the chairman for
holding the hearing; the members praise the witness _ an
administration official or specialist of some sort _ for his or her
work on the subject, and so on.
   With some 250 committees and subcommittees in Congress, the 100
Senate members and their 435 colleagues in the House are busy
people. Most sit on three or four committees, which is where most
congressional action is taken.
   Except during floor votes, the main chambers of the House and
Senate are virtually empty, with only a speaker on the podium and a
stray clerk or usher in the aisles.
   More often than not, lawmakers will stay away from a plenary
session to make time for a meeting with constituents visiting
Washington. After all, these are the people who will get them
re-elected.
   On a recent day, Rep. Dave McCurdy's schedule had 15 constituent
visits. Aides to the Oklahoma Democrat say this is an unusally
heavy load, although not rare.
   McCurdy and his colleagues also have to travel to their home
districts periodically to meet with voters and tend to local
business. Last year, McCurdy flew home 11 times.
   No wonder, then, that much of the work on Capitol Hill gets
accomplished by staff members rather than by the lawmakers
themselves. Most members have a staff of about 20, although some _
especially if they chair influential committees _ have double that.
In all, Congress employs about 20,000 people _ including security
police, cleaners and clerks.
   While visits by foreign visitors _ presidents, prime ministers
and the like _ usually get bigger headlines, American celebrities
are often a much bigger draw at the Capitol itself.
   Elizabeth Taylor came to Capitol Hill to lobby for a bill that
would give $600 million to AIDS sufferers.
   Although Congress has been discussing the proposed bill for
weeks, Miss Taylor's appearance at a hearing and a news conference
drew dozens of lawmakers eager to shake her hand or stare into her
famous violet eyes.
   ``It took Elizabeth Taylor to get you to one of my hearings,''
the panel's chairman, California Rep. Barbara Boxer, admonished her
Democratic colleague from Illinois, Richard Durbin.
   Dante Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
made time last week for boxer Roberto Duran. The former
welterweight champion came to Congress to seek aid for his native
Panama, food for hungry children and housing for Panamanians left
homeless by the U.S. invasion last December.
   And then there were the marauding mollusks.
   Reporters on Capitol Hill, sifting through their mail boxes,
pulled out a plastic bag stuffed with mussel shells appended to a
press release.
   ``Sen. John Glenn and Rep. Henry Nowak today proposed a $40
million plan to control the zebra mussel, the small shellfish
attacking water intake pipes and creating environmental problems in
the Great Lakes,'' the release said.
   Glenn was joined at a news conference by seven lawmakers
battling the spread of the mollusks, which reached the Great Lakes
by stowing away on freighters from Europe.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' Glenn said.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The revival of the species: The rebirth of the extinct
quagga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   THE QUAGGA is extinct
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or at least it was, until a team of international scientists began trying to
resurrect this zebra-like creature, native to the arid vastness of South
Africa's Karoo.
Coloured rich brown to blend in with the red dust of the Karoo - a huge,
infertile, sparsely populated area of the Cape - the quagga looked like a
zebra with less than half the normal stripes. Karoo farmers saw it as an
unwelcome competitor for grazing, and set out to exterminate it. The last
specimen died more than a hundred years ago in an Amsterdam zoo.
Now scientists believe they can bring back the quagga, named by the original
Hottentot inhabitants of the Karoo for the distinctive sound it made. At a
nature reserve 200 kilometres north-east of Cape Town, they have begun
selectively breeding plains zebras (the striped animals most familiar to
Europeans), hoping to restore the distinctive colouration of the quagga.
If they succeed, there is a chance that other long-dead animals could be
saved from extinction - but only if they are closely related to an extant
species which can be used as a breeding base. The dinosaur and the
brontosaurus will remain in oblivion; but scientists might, for example, be
able to recreate the extinct blue antelope.
In fact, the only hope for resurrecting the quagga is that it is not truly
'extinct'. Genetic research has shown that it was a sub-species of the
plains zebra; scientists believe its colouration may simply be diluted in
the extant population of such zebras, where isolated individuals (darker in
colour and faintly striped) already slightly resemble quaggas.
This resemblance is borne out by genetic evidence: DNA extracted from dried
tissue and blood of stuffed quaggas matches that of the plains Zebra,
proving that the quagga is a sub-species.
'If a species is gone, nothing can be done about it because the entire gene
pool is gone,' says Reinhold Rau, head of taxidermy at the South African
museum in Cape Town, and the father of the quagga project. But the gene pool
of the plains zebra is still available for re-breeding the quagga, by a
process similar to selective breeding of livestock.
Baby Reina, one of six foals who form the first generation of the quagga
breeding project, demonstrates how it is done. She was born of parents
specially selected in the wild for their faint striping, and her stripes are
fainter still. But scientists were not so lucky with the other foals: one
has distinctly more prominent stripes than either parent, and the others
show little progress toward quagga colouration. Scientists hope to see firm
results in 10 years - but it could take longer.
Some wildlife experts dispute the validity of the project: 'We can breed a
zebra which will look like a quagga but it will never, ever be a quagga. All
we know about the quagga was what it looked like and where it was found. We
know nothing about its behaviour, its habitat . . . ' says Zane Erasmus,
ranger at the Vrolijkheid Nature Reserve where the breeding is being done.
Scientists were not able to get a full genetic fingerprint of the quagga,
because none of the crucial 'nuclear DNA' survived in the stuffed specimens;
so they will never know whether a re-bred quagga is just a man-made
lookalike or a truly genetic recreation.
And after several generations in captivity the quagga may no longer be able
to survive in the wild. But if they can be released into Karoo nature
reserves, where there are no major predators, it would be a small step
towards rectifying the damage done by man to Africa's wildlife.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Hungry Little Creature Threatens Great Lakes Food
Chain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A spiny-tailed little creature with a big
appetite, a water flea that may have hitched a ride from Europe
aboard Soviet freighters, is threatening to disrupt the food chain
in the Great Lakes, a federal scientist said Tuesday.
   Only a half-inch long, the predator called bythotrephes is a
variety of water flea with a long, spiny tail, said Henry A.
Vanderploeg, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   What bythotrephes lacks in size, it makes up for in appetite.
Vanderploeg said his research showed one of the little creatures in
a day can clear 1{ quarts of water of the native water fleas that
provide food for newborn fish.
   ``For an animal this small, it represents a high rate of
clearance,'' Vanderploeg said at NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental
Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The water fleas native to the Great Lakes provide food for
juvenile alewives, bloaters and perch, which in turn are food for
salmon, trout and other large predatory fish.
   Because of bythotrephes, in future years ``it is possible that,
for example, alewives, certain forage fish, could be less abundant,
and since these forage fish would be less abundant, salmon and
trout could also become less abundant,'' Vanderploeg said.
   However, a more precise forecast of the effect of the European
predator must await a better understanding of the Great Lakes food
chain, he said.
   Bythotrephes were first found in Lake Huron in 1984 and by 1986
had spread to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. They are now found in all
the Great Lakes.
   The predators may have been brought from Europe in water ballast
aboard empty grain freighters from the Soviet Union and dumped into
the lakes, NOAA said.
   Bythotrephes are found in freshwater throughout northern Europe.
There, however, ``it is not disruptive to the food chain in the
sense that it has been there for a long time,'' Vanderploeg said.
``All the plankton and fish that have evolved there are used to
having it around.''
   Although the European predator can damage the Great Lakes food
supply for very young fish, ``at a certain stage in the life cycle
of a fish, bythotrephes would then become food for that fish,''
Vanderploeg said.

   President Bush on Thursday signed a $2.5
billion bill authorizing new water projects for flood control,
storm damage reduction, inland navigation and port development.
   ``In addition to authorizing worthwhile water resources
projects, the legislation includes a number of provisions that
protect and restore this nation's environment, which I
wholeheartedly support,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Even so, Bush said, the legislation ``contains a number of
special-interest provisions'' in some of the projects.
   He said these included developing recreation facilities, levee
beautification, agricultural land improvements and, in one
instance, replacing a bridge.
   ``Because I believe in a strong water resources program, and
despite my concerns about a number of inappropriate provisions, I
have approved this bill,'' Bush said.
   Bush also signed legislation designed to protect coastal inland
waters from the zebra mussel and other so-called ``nuisance
species''
   It contains provisions for wetlands restoration and protection,
especially in Louisiana, and fish and wildlife conservation in the
Great Lakes.

JURY WEIGHING ISSUES IN RARE ZEBRA SKINS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: A SAFARI LEADER IS BEING TRIED FOR BRINGING THE HIDES TO THE UNITED 
STATES, WHERE THE SALE OF SUCH PELTS FROM THE THREATENED SPECIES IS ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury in Los Angeles was asked to decide Wednesday whether a 
South African safari tour leader illegally imported nine skins from a rare and 
threatened species of zebra and tried to peddle them in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that Wallace Charles Venter, 37, knew it was illegal 
to sell the Hartmann's Mountain Zebra skins in the United States and had 
written a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saying that the skins 
were not intended for sale. 
</P>
<P>
But in August and September, Venter placed two classified ads in the Orange 
County Register offering to sell zebra hides for up to $1,900, according to 
documents prepared by the prosecution. An anonymous reader called Fish &amp; 
Wildlife to complain, and Venter was arrested in September after he allegedly 
sold one of the skins to an undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's attorney, Morton H. Boren, said Venter leads safari tours in South 
Africa and came to the United States "to see if he could drum up business." 
Boren said Venter did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral 
while he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins. Venter thought 
that transaction was perfectly legal, Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is really confused," Boren said. "He honestly believed it was OK for 
him to use one or two of these skins for collateral. . . . If he was going to 
sell these skins illegally, he would just sell them and split." 
</P>
<P>
Venter is charged with importing nine skins for sale, selling one skin, and 
making a false statement to a government official, Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government considers the Hartmann's Mountain Zebra a "threatened" 
species, which means that it is likely to become an endangered species within 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the common black-and-white zebra, the Hartmann's zebra is brown and buff 
colored and has an unusual pattern of cross-bar stripes. At last count in 1985, 
there were only 7,000 of the animals left in Southwest Africa and neighboring 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
Boren said Venter's zebra hides were taken with the approval of South African 
authorities as part of a drought cull. 
</P>
<P>
"The herd was too big for the water supply, so they captured and destroyed 40 
to 60 of them," Boren said. The skins were sold to a tannery, which sold them 
to a friend of Venter's, who asked Venter to bring them to the United States, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he thought, 'Well, if Americans can buy them there, when I'm in America 
why don't I see about taking orders for them in South Africa, with all the 
(proper) documents,' " Boren explained. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law forbids importing threatened species for commercial activities, 
including their sale, but it does allow tourists to bring the skins home for 
their own personal and non-commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John S. Wiley Jr. would not comment on the case as the 
jury was deliberating Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the prosecution's memorandum, Venter had begun trying to sell 
the skins even before they were brought to Los Angeles on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in his safari suit and speaking with a noticeable accent, Venter 
visited a Fish and Wildlife Service office and picked up information about 
wildlife-import regulations, and placed several calls to the department on Aug. 
1, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The first newspaper ad, which began appearing on Aug. 26, said, "African Games 
Skins, zebra, Springbok Etc. $50," followed by a Long Beach-area telephone 
number. The second ad offered "Zebra skins, $1,900," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
On about Aug. 30, a 27-year-old Yorba Linda man called Venter and asked about 
buying the skins. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a real heavy accent, South African," said Donald K. Augustine, who was 
called to testify at the trial. "We joked about the problems over in South 
Africa. He was a nice man, he really was, considering . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Augustine said that Venter promised to bring the skins to his office in Orange 
for examination. Augustine said he had friends who had brought zebra skins back 
from safaris and had no idea that the skins Venter was selling belonged to a 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to know it was illegal," Augustine said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'Is this legal?' and he said 'Yeah.' I said, 'You've got 
permission?' He said, 'Yeah.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Venter never showed up for the appointment and Augustine dropped the matter 
until federal prosecutors found his telephone number among Venter's papers and 
called him to testify. 
</P>
<P>
When the skins arrived in Los Angeles, a customs inspector thought the shipment 
was unusual and asked for a notarized affidavit from Venter that they were for 
personal and not commercial use, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
Venter did write a letter saying that the skins were purchased by a man named 
Sidowski, and that five would be used to decorate Sidowski's house and the 
other four would be used by Venter as a backdrop for photographs to promote his 
safari business, the prosecution's memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter added, "There is no intention of selling them." 
</P>
<P>
When customs officials opened the crate, they found the zebra skins as well as 
a stuffed Nile crocodile, which is an endangered species that is not permitted 
in this country under any circumstances, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The crocodile was seized, but prosecutors could not locate Sidowski and are not 
sure whether such a person exists, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The zebra skins were shown to the jury and introduced into evidence. In his 
closing statement, Boren said that the jury should not be swayed by their 
emotions toward killing wildlife, but should focus strictly on the legal issues 
involved. The case is being heard by U.S. District Court Judge William D. 
Keller.

<HEAD>Erie's Cleaner Now, No Fires in Almost 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years after the Cuyahoga River last
caught fire, officials say Lake Erie and its tributaries are
cleaner than they have been in decades.
   Scores of Lake Erie beaches will be open in Ohio this year, and
more than 25 million walleye thrive in Erie's waters. Boating has
become so popular that many marinas in the Toledo area are running
out of dock space.
   A few decades ago, Lake Erie had only three clean beaches, and
fish were dying at a rapid rate. An oil slick on the Cuyahoga
caught fire June 22, 1969.
   The dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease
in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in
Lake Erie, using up oxygen and killing fish, said Laura Fay, a
research associate for the Center for Lake Erie Area Research.
   Phosphate pollution levels were decreased largely through
improvement of sewage treatment plants, she said.
   Half the people living in the Great Lakes basin live near Lake
Erie, including residents of Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit and Erie,
Pa. Eleven million people use Lake Erie for their drinking water,
Ms. Fay said.
   Although fish now appear to be thriving in the shallowest of the
Great Lakes, Ms. Fay said the bottom of Lake Erie and its
tributaries has sediments contaminated with such materials as
mercury and cancer-causing PCBs.
   Funding for research and cleanup on the Great Lakes has been
decreasing, she said, even though contaminated sediments are a more
chronic problem than phosphates.
   ``I hate to see people sit back and rest on their laurels,'' Ms.
Fay said. ``We've really come a long way, but the toxic problem is
something we really can't see. Some of the effects are really going
to be subtle. We might have lower reproductive efficiency of
walleye or darter, but we're not going to see that for a while.''
   The Cuyahoga River, which has ignited three times since 1936,
remains an area of concern, along with several other Lake Erie
shipping channels, because of the pollutants that have settled on
the bottom.
   The International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water Quality,
in a 1987 report, said sediments in the Cuyahoga are tainted with
PCBs, ammonia, cyanide and lead.
   Because of the contaminants, the Ohio Department of Health
advises people not to eat catfish caught in the channel and carp
caught in the open waters of Lake Erie, said Deborah Gray, a
toxicologist in the Division of Epidemiology.
   Catfish and carp feed on the bottom of Lake Erie, she said, and
tests have shown that nearly half have PCB concentrations that
exceed levels recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   The Health Department also has issued an advisory for all fish
caught in the Black River in Lorain and the Ashtabula River in
Ashtabula, which empty into Lake Erie. There is no advisory for the
Cuyahoga.
   ``An advisory is just that _ an advisory,'' she said. ``We're
talking about a very small incremental risk to someone who would
eat this fish. But what we're saying is that there are still fish
exceeding the FDA limit and we think people should know about
this.''
   But shallow Lake Erie is cleaner than many of the Great Lakes,
largely because it is is able to flush itself every 2.6 years,
officials said. The flush time for some of the upper lakes, which
are 1,000 feet deep, is more than a century. Ms. Fay said Lake Erie
also has more organic substances that bind up toxic materials.
   Bob Wysenski, environmental scientist for the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, said Ohio's beaches generally are safer for
swimming now than at any time in the past decade.
   He cited water quality statistics at 20 Lake Erie beaches that
show a general downward trend in fecal coliform, a bacteria that
can cause flu-like symptoms or ear and eye infections.
   There have been no documented cases of severe illnesses caused
by swimming in Lake Erie in the past decade, he said.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: A safari that ends on the beach - Richard Gilbert
divides his Kenyan holiday between the luxurious game lodges of Tsavo and
the Indian Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DELICATELY laundered white mosquito net around my bed made the room look
like a bridal suite. I ordered a beer. As I quenched a thirst brought on by
a morning game drive in the bush, I glanced through the window and counted
eight zebra, five water-buck and nine elephants heading towards a
water-hole. It was early February in Kenya's Tsavo national park and the
temperature had not dropped below 93'c Fahrenheit all day.
Tsavo, halfway between Mombasa and Nairobi, is the largest game sanctuary in
East Africa. Thirty-six hours earlier we had struggled through fog to
Gatwick; now we were outbidding each other with sightings of exotic animals.
This was my first two-centre holiday - a week divided between the comforts
of an Indian Ocean beach hotel outside Mombasa and game rides into the bush
of Tsavo and the Taita Hills private game sanctuary.
Seven of us climbed on to a safari mini-bus for a game drive to Salt Lick
Lodge, a sanctuary in the Taita Hills that was once a sisal plantation. The
success of any game drive depends largely on the skills, prescience and
character of the driver-guide. With Hamid, we were lucky.
Off the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, Hamid turned the zebra- striped Nissan down
red dirt tracks surrounded by thorn scrub and short grass. He could
interpret the significance of a lump of animal dung or a patch of
smoothed-down grass with tremendous skill. Following trails and tracks, we
saw giraffes, gazelles, zebra, dikdik and exotic birds that would have
driven twitchers into a frenzy.
The game park lodges for overnight accommodation are a misnomer, having less
to do with Karen Blixen than with Conrad Hilton. Indeed, Salt Lick Safari
Lodge in Taita Hills is owned by Hilton. Built around a natural salt lick,
the clusters of rooms are on pillars to let the animals wander freely
underneath the lodge.
At dawn we set off north for Tsavo, once notorious for man-eating lions and
more recently for the Somali poachers who have plundered the black rhino
population.
Just when you think the views are unsurpassable, you reach Voi Lodge in
Tsavo East. Built on an escarpment, the lodge overlooks a remarkable series
of linked water holes. From my room I watched the gigantic amphitheatre fill
with dozens of elephants, their hides rusted from rolling in the red earth
around the water holes.
Waking at first light the following day, I disentangled myself from the
mosquito net and watched the continuing parade of wildlife, headed this time
by water buffalo and ostriches. The morning was still cool; the scent of
wild flowers filled the lodge.
The last lap of the safari took us to Tsavo West national park, with a
detour past Mzima Springs from where millions of gallons of crystal water
are piped daily to Mombasa. This oasis, surrounded by a valley of arid lava,
is a haven for hippos.
On the rough track to Ngulia Lodge, an inspired diversion by Hamid took us
to a pride of lions in a broad patch of long grass. Two new-born cubs romped
with elder members of the family; then, seeking a feed, they were gently
cuffed away by a lioness.
Ngulia Lodge, in Tsavo West, is a mecca for migrating birds. The lights of
the isolated lodge attract hundreds of species, and there is a roll-call of
rare visitors. Madagascar bee-eaters, penduline tits, hammerkops, wheatears,
warblers and waders are all regulars, together with a species bearing the
memorable name of 'red-cheeked cordon bleu'.
Four days of safari are rewarded with a long weekend of relaxation at Safari
Beach hotel outside Mombasa. How safe is a safari holiday?
The sudden spate of attacks on tourists in the Masai Mara, east of Tsavo,
earlier this year was unprecedented for Kenya and led to increased security.
Operators are insisting on a minimum of two vehicles travelling together on
particular game drives in the Mara's remoter areas. But travellers to Tsavo
 -unlike the Mara, Tsavo is controlled by the Kenya Wildlife Service - have
faced no difficulties. Kenya is still safer than Key West.
Richard Gilbert travelled with Portland Holidays, whose 'Portrait of Kenya'
combined safari and beach holidays start at Pounds 689 per person for a week
(from November 1). The cost for 10 nights' beach plus four days' safari is
around Pounds 823 per person (again, from Nov 1). Address: 218 Great

   The Canadian government proposed measures to reduce high Great Lakes water levels that are causing heavy damage to shoreline property in the U.S. and Canada. 

   The proposals include removal of landfill in the Niagara River, which links Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. 
Environment Minister Tom McMillan also proposed an increased flow of water from Lake Erie through the Black Rock Canal, which runs along the U.S. shore of the upper Niagara River. 

   The minister said the Canadian government "is committed to doing everything in its power to combat the problem of high water levels on the Great Lakes." 
Even with normal precipitation, he warned that "dangerously high levels will persist on Lakes Michigan, Huron, St. Clair and Erie for at least another two to three years." 
Lake St. Clair is between Lake Huron and Lake Erie. 

   In the past 150 years, landfill by private property owners has blocked as much as 40% of the Niagara River bed in some locations, restricting water flow into Lake Ontario. 
Mr. McMillan's landfill-removal proposal requires the consent of Ontario's provincial government. 

   In Washington, a State Department official said the U.S. hasn't received Canada's proposal to increase the water flow through the Black Rock Canal. 
Mr. McMillan said the flow could be increased by 1,200 cubic feet a second, an increase of less than 1% of the total average water flow between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. 

   The International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency, also is expected to recommend later this year various measures to relieve the high-water problem, which has caused several hundred million dollars worth of damage in recent years. 

   Mr. McMillan indicated that the commission may recommend, among other things, an increased diversion of water out of Lake Michigan at Chicago. 
The diversion, which moves Great Lakes water to the Mississippi River system, is currently limited by a Supreme Court order to 3,200 cubic feet a second. 
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.) has introduced legislation that would allow the Chicago water diversion to be increased to 10,000 cubic feet a second. 

   Lakeshore property owners also have been campaigning for a halt to a Canadian diversion of about 5,600 cubic feet a second of water into Lake Superior from hydroelectric dams in Ontario, but the provincial government has opposed changing those flows. 
Mr. McMillan asked the Ontario government to reconsider its position so that Canada will be able to respond immediately to any recommendations by the International Joint Commission. 

   U.S. and Canadian hydrologists, meanwhile, said that changes in existing water diversions will have only a small impact on water levels.

   A toxic chemical spill snaking its way
toward Lake Erie on Thursday forced the evacuation of hundreds of
people and fouled drinking water for at least 22,000 along the
Sandusky River.
   At least three people were treated for injuries after an
estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene, an octane enhancer, spilled
Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline south of here.
   Five hundred people, including 300 residents of Old Fort, 10
miles to the south, were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday because
of the fumes.
   ``It could get worse,'' said Sandusky County Sheriff Dave
Gangwer. ``It depends on how slow it moves, and it's slowing down
rapidly.''
   The spill reached Fremont late Thursday, and the city stopped
pumping water from the river, officials said. They estimated a
14-mile section of the river was contaminated; the river was
flowing at about 1 mph.
   Officials fear the spill killed up to 1,000 fish, many of them
under ice, in Sugar Creek and the Sandusky River, and could affect
waterfowl, said Mike Taylor, a wildlife officer for the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources.
   Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency for Sandusky
County, which includes Fremont. The declaration makes state
assistance available.
   About 4 million gallons of water, one day's normal supply, was
put in reserve tanks before the spill arrived, said Gary
Rathfelder, assistant superintendent of Fremont's water plant.
   Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or
poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook
published by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   The spill was detected around 6 p.m. Wednesday after Sun workers
noticed that pressure had dropped in the pipeline, which carries
the chemical from a Sun oil refinery in Toledo to a refinery in
Marcus Hook, Pa.
   Sonya Elam, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Disaster Services Agency,
said the chemical spilled in a swampy area in Seneca County, south
of Fremont, population 22,000, and then leaked into Sugar Creek, a
tributary of the Sandusky River. The Sandusky River flows north
into Lake Erie, 10 miles north of here.
   Ms. Elam said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency workers were
building a road into the swampy area and setting up a dike to
contain the chemical.
   Bob Arnet, an environmental safety coordinator for the Tulsa,
Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said authorities had not located the
leak.
   ``It's been shut off, but it's still leaking,'' Arnet said.
   Neither EPA nor Sun officials could estimate how much of the
chemical had entered the Sandusky River.
   Two emergency workers were treated at Tiffin Mercy Hospital
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, while a
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All
were subsequently released.
   Bud Davis, a corporate spokesman for Sun, said the company would
take ``liability and responsibility for the leak.''
   Jack Fox, operations manager for Sun Pipe Line, a Sun Co.
subsidiary, said the source of the leak was an 18-inch split in the
pipeline, which is buried 3{ feet deep and carries the chemical
from northwest Ohio to a refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa.
   The cleanup could cost as much as $1 million and last three to
four months, Davis said.
   EPA officials said they believed much of the chemical would
dissipate by the time it reaches Lake Erie.
   Don Higgins, environmental coordinator for the Ohio EPA, said he
did not expect lasting environmental problems, but added, ``I
expect quite a bit of environmental impact on Sugar Creek.''
   ``It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said.
``It won't kill you, but you don't want to be around it for too
long.''

ZEBRA SKINS IMPORTER GUILTY OF GIVING FALSE STATEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A FEDERAL JURY ACQUITTED A SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY 
IMPORTING AND SELLING NINE PELTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A South African national accused of illegally importing nine skins from a 
threatened species of zebra with the intent to unlawfully peddle them in Orange 
County was acquitted by a federal court jury Thursday of importing and selling 
the skins, but found guilty of making a false statement to a government 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prosecution presented evidence that Wallace Charles Venter, 37, 
allegedly sold one of the skins to an undercover agent of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Venter "sold a threatened species knowing that it was illegal to do so," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. John S. Wiley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Venter) said that there was no intention of selling (the skins) and that 
they would remain at a friend's house," said Wiley, who tried the case in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's intentions were at issue in the case because while it is illegal under 
federal law to import a threatened species for commercial use, import is 
permitted for personal and non-commercial use. "The jury apparently believed 
the defendant's claim that he really didn't know (the sale) was illegal," Wiley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged that Venter placed two classified ads in the Orange 
County Register offering to sell hides of the threatened Hartmann's Mountain 
Zebra for up to $1,900. Venter was arrested in September after he allegedly 
sold one of the skins to the undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's attorney, Morton H. Boren, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
He contended in an interview Wednesday that Venter, who leads safari tours in 
South Africa, did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral while 
he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins. Venter thought that 
transaction was legal, Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury was convinced that Venter knew what he was doing when he sent a 
notarized letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saying that the skins 
had been purchased overseas by a man named Richard Sidowski, Wiley said. 
Prosecutors could not locate Sidowski for verification. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fish and Wildlife Service inquired as to what the skins were really going 
to be used for," Wiley said. "They needed a letter of explanation, and the 
defendant wrote and signed and notarized a letter saying he had no intention of 
selling the skins and that the skins would go to the house of Mr. Sidowski. The 
jury found that to be a false statement." 
</P>
<P>
Venter faces up to five years in prison, up to a $10,000 fine, or both, for 
making the false statement, Wiley said. U.S. District Court Judge William D. 
Keller set bail at $25,000 pending sentencing, but he could order Venter held 
in custody if he determines that Venter might flee the country. A sentencing 
date was not immediately set.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: FROM AFRICAN PLAINS TO THE JUNGLE OF COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month we'll study a couple of new -- and excellent -- videos, one dealing 
with Africa, the other with Costa Rica. And while both deal with wildlife 
conservation, the Costa Rica video involves other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa" (two videos), Eco Ventures, 45 minutes each (1988). These two 
remarkable videos, produced by Megan Epler Wood and narrated by George 
Plimpton, will be of special interest to African safari planners and 
ecology-minded armchair travelers. Each video combines spectacular scenery with 
a detailed study of the animals found in parks along the Tanzania-Kenya border. 
</P>
<P>
The first tape opens with stunning views of the vast, 10,000-square-mile 
Serengeti Plain and a map showing the path of migration that the hundreds of 
thousands of zebra, wildebeest and gazelles make on their annual search for 
grasslands and water. According to the narration, it's an ecological cycle that 
has continued for 10 million years. 
</P>
<P>
The camera follows the trek and shows how the animals surmount the incredible 
hardships of their long journey, including the constant threat of predators -- 
hyenas, wild dogs and lions. 
</P>
<P>
You get contrasting, touching scenes of the family-oriented zebra grooming each 
other and the birth of a soon-doomed wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
The sound and sight of the thundering herd as it struggles across the swiftly 
flowing Mara River are a video highlight that Plimpton calls "one of the 
greatest wildlife spectacles on earth." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wood captures some poignant and amusing scenes of the six-ton elephants 
splashing and playing as they cool off in the mud holes of Amboseli National 
Park at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Elephant teen-agers are shown 
trunk-wrestling, and at an elephant family gathering, viewers watch seniors 
embracing each other as if greeting old friends. Other animals shown in the 
park include flamingoes, cape buffalo, wart hogs and ostriches. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a discussion between Plimpton and Russell Train, 
chairman of the World Wildlife Fund/The Conservation Foundation, on the threat 
from poachers to this one-great concentration of elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The second tape opens with film clips of an Osa and Martin Johnson safari of 
the 1920s, then concentrates on following the social structure and daily life 
of a pride of lions. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers follow the female as she stalks her prey, while the male spends his day 
lying around surveying his realm, and the cubs wrestle and explore. The pride 
survives in spite of the fact that, according to Plimpton, the female is a poor 
huntress, missing five out of six tries. There also are brief scenes of some of 
the other cats in the Masai Mara Game Reserve, including leopards and cheetahs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, producer Wood opens with early film from the movie "King Kong," 
comparing it with the gentle mountain gorillas found in the Virunga Mountains 
of Rwanda, where the late anthropologist Dian Fossey lived and died studying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The gorillas, which usually live at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, don't 
survive in captivity. Viewers will see the females flirting with the males, and 
the majestic silverback males protecting their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain gorillas are vegetarians, and scenes show them munching on the 
greenery and lolling in the sun, a favorite activity, while young ones stumble 
and frolic as they leave their mother to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Plimpton and Train conclude this segment with a discussion on preserving the 
mountain gorilla and the part that tourism plays in making the world aware of 
the nened for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are available from Eco Ventures, 2021 L. Street N.W., Suite 250, 
Washington, D.C. 20036. Call toll-free (800) 862-8900. Price: $29.95, or two 
for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Rica" (Megaview Productions International), 1988, 34 minutes. This is 
one of the few videos on Costa Rica, and it's remarkably good. For those who 
have been there, for those planning a trip or for those just curious, it's a 
worthwhile addition to a travel video collection. 
</P>
<P>
Against a montage of quick scenes showing some of the beauty and appeal of this 
Central American country -- lush green forests, rivers, volcanoes, gambling 
casinos and fishing -- the narrator gives viewers a bit of history as well as 
vital statistics on the high literacy rate, climate, number of bird species 
(850), national parks (26), which airlines fly there and an overview of the 
type of its hotels, facilities and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The major part of the video, however, takes viewers on a series of tours that 
cover the most popular tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
These include a tour of the capital, San Jose, showing scenes of the shopping 
district, central market place, national museum, national theater and 
restaurants. Side trips from San Jose include a visit to Sarchi and its ox-cart 
factory, where the colorful native souvenirs, as well as other crafts, are made 
and sold, and a visit to the enchanting Orosi Valley on the tumultuous 
Reventazon River for scenes of an exciting river rafting trip. This is followed 
by a tour to Tiquicia, "Tico" country, to a typical adobe farm-ranch restaurant 
to enjoy scenes of native food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Irazu volcano, topping 11,000 feet and from which you can see both the 
Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, is another tour destination, as is a visit to the 
rim of the awesome, still-active Poas volcano. At Cartago, at the foot of 
Irazu, viewers also see the Basilica de Los Angeles, where the La Negrita (the 
Black Virgin) statue is enshrined and to whom miracles have been attributed. 
</P>
<P>
A video highlight is the ride on the jungle train that connects Limon to San 
Jose, passing through coffee and banana plantations and small villages of the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
Other tours include a jungle adventure launch ride along the Colorado River and 
canals, with a stop at a lodge in the town of Colorado, and trips to the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest and the Carara Biological Reserve to view some of the 
many examples of the colorful and unusual plants, birds and animals being 
protected in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Nature lovers also will be rewarded with film and narration on the leatherback 
turtles seen laying their eggs on the beach. A final stop is at Lake Arenal, 
where fishermen are seen big-game fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the production was filmed in cooperation with the Swiss Travel 
Service, a tour company of Costa Rica, there are no blatant commercial plugs 
and no tie-ins with hotels or other tourist facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Megaview Productions, 255 N. El Cielo Road, Suite 155, 
Palm Springs, Calif. 92262, (619) 366-8464. Price: $25.

<LEADPARA>  HARD-CORE news purists always have given CBS's "60 Minutes" gang a bad time
over the show's frequent "soft" interviews with show-business celebrities, but
now those show-biz interviews are beginning to look like solid gold.;   Case
in point: Tonight's two-hour CBS special, "60 Minutes: The Entertainers,"
culling some of the very best moments from all the show-biz interviews the
show has done over the past couple of decades. This is a terrifically
entertaining show, probably because the good parts of those interviews are so
good, and the bad parts were left behind in the archives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Among the memorable moments:;   (check) Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy
faking out a startled Mike Wallace by pretending they'd decided to separate
because, as Cronyn put it, "Jess has her eye on another fellow, and I'd like
to play the field while I'm still vertical.";   (check) Lena Horne, at 64,
telling Ed Bradley she still sings earthy songs because "you can't help your
sexual nature.";   (check) Opera immortal Beverly Sills comparing herself to
"a fairly decent plumber.";   (check) Paul Simon grieving over the breakup of
his marriage to Carrie Fisher and celebrating a long overdue rapport with his
father.;   (check) Jackie Gleason explaining Ralph Kramden's true character to
Morley Safer.;   As you might expect, veteran correspondent Wallace comes off
as the bete noir of the show, asking the rudest questions. We see him bullying
Vladimir Horowitz into playing "Stars and Stripes Forever" for the first time
in 20 years, accusing Johnny Carson of being an alcoholic, ridiculing Shirley
MacLaine for her New Age ideas ("You don't have to be that unpleasant," she
tells him. "It doesn't become you") and even asking Itzhak Perlman why so many
"world class fiddle players" are Jewish. ("Our fingers are circumcised,"
Perlman retorts.);   The result is a crackling two hours that will zip by
before you know it, leaving you with a hankering for more.; 'Beyond Reality';
The USA cable network is rapidly moving into more hours of original
programming. Unfortunately, not much of it is any better than "Beyond
Reality," an oddball hybrid that premieres tonight at 9. It falls somewhere
between a weekly mystery series and a "reality" show based on screwball cover
stories from the tabloids.;   Shari Belafonte and Carl Marotte play
parapsychologists who each week investigate a different case, which the
producers claim is based on "reported incidents." In the preview episode, they
check out one of Marotte's college students, an introverted dweeb who walks
through her looking glass like Alice and into a parallel dimension where she
isn't a dweeb. This incident may have been reported somewhere, but I don't
think it was in the New York Times.;   Let me be kind and just say I found
"Beyond Reality" profoundly stupid.; 'Servants of Twilight'; Author Dean R.
Koontz is the cut-rate Stephen King, another horror novelist with some
impressive sales figures, especially in the paperback line. His great weakness
is his familiar plots. That's pretty much the main thing wrong with tonight's
Koontz adaptation, "Servants of Twilight," on the Showtime pay-TV network.;  
Based on Koontz's "Twilight," the movie owes too much to "The Omen," with its
plot about religious fanatics trying to bump off a little boy they think is
the Anti-Christ. However, once you're past the first bumpy, flashback-choked
minutes, "Servants of Twilight" delivers plenty of thrills, even with the
stale plot.;   Bruce Greenwood plays the private detective trying to protect
unwed mother Belinda Bauer and her 6-year-old son (Jarrett Lennon) from the
evil followers of Mother Grace (Grace Zabriskie) and her Church of the
Twilight. Once he's on the case, we're in for a wild and violent chase that
leaves you quite breathless by the climactic struggle between good, evil, a
leftover giant from "Twin Peaks" and an attic full of bats.;   By no means is
"Servants of Twilight" a masterwork of the genre, but thrill-seekers could do
a lot worse than this fast-paced entertainment.; 'Zebras'; "Zebras: Patterns
in the Grass," Sunday night's edition of "National Geographic Explorer" on the
TBS cable network, is a fascinating saga of the annual 300-mile migration of
zebra herds in Botswana. Here's one overwhelmingly good reason to watch: There
were 45,000 zebras making the journey in 1981, but only 7,000 were left to try
this year.;   Narrator Brian Dennehy calls the trek a "gauntlet of death."
He's not kidding. We watch as lions, hyenas, wild dog packs and even hunters
ravage the herds as they head south to feed on fertile grasslands each year.; 
 Among the unusual sights captured by famed naturalists and film makers Dereck
and Beverly Joubert: mother zebras shielding their foals from other zebras so
the newborn progeny will learn to "home in" on only their mother's distinctive
pattern of stripes; stallions and "bachelor" zebras lining up to protect foals
from wild dogs; a female zebra's sire testing a male suitor's worthiness as a
mate by fighting with him; lions and hyenas dragging down an amazing 150 foals
in just 10 terror-filled days.;   This is another powerful film in this fine
series, reminding us of the majesty of the many species now in sharp decline
all over the world.; 'Played in the USA'; This Sunday cable's The Learning
Channel (TLC) starts a new 13-week series called "Played in the USA," which
chronicles the diversity of music performed in America through the works of
independent film and video producers. The kickoff event is extra special: a
documentary on the recording of Broadway's "Company" soundtrack album, which
has been kept from public view for 20 years by a legal hassle.;   Filmed by
the acclaimed D.A. Pennebaker and Richard Leacock ("Monterey Pop," "Don't Look
Back"), the cinema verite documentary of a marathon 18-hour recording session
was tied up over music copyrights until recently settled.;   Not only does the
film show us how they record a Broadway score, but it also gives us intriguing
behind-the-scenes glimpses of composer Stephen Sondheim, legendary
producer-director Harold Prince and others at work with the show's stars,
Elaine Stritch, Dean Jones and Barbara Barrie.;   A special bonus: Look for a
rare, early sequence featuring Charles Kimbrough, now best known as anchorman
Jim Dial in "Murphy Brown."  </TEXT>

   HAVANA: lose them.''

<TEXT>
   Ron Refsnider, a staff biologist for the federal Department of
the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service in Minneapolis, says
several states have laws governing mussel shells, although they are
inconsistent and vary widely.
   Refsnider says it's unlikely the agency will impose quotas or
restrict shelling, even though 25 species of mussels are on the
endangered list and 75 species are candidates.
   ``If anything regarding the threat to mussels is overstated,''
Refsnider says, ``it's the ease of solving the problem.
   ``Mussels are very good indicators of the biological health of
an ecosystem. A lot of factors have contributed to the very serious
mussel decline. It would cost millions of dollars to solve, and no
one is certain as to the cause.''
   Mussels don't help their cause any, Refsnider says, because they
are ``not a real charismatic species.'' They have largely been
ignored except for their commercial value.
   Mussels and their smaller cousins, clams, long have had
commercial value. American Indians collected them, ate the meat and
used the shells as ornaments. Prospectors set off ``pearl rushes''
on mussels in the 19th century, and in 1891 the pearl button
industry was launched using discarded shells.
   Development of plastics in the 1920s killed the pearl button
industry, and mussels had relative peace until water pollution
started taking its toll in the 1950s.
   The spread of mussels also was restricted by construction of
locks and dams as well as by declines in certain species of fish
that carry embryonic mussels like hitchhikers up and down river
systems.
   Recent studies about mussel die-offs in American rivers over the
past five years have focused on an invasion of disease-carrying
Asiatic clams. No matter the cause, their loss trickles down
through the ecosystem. Rivers become more polluted without nature's
filters, and wildlife that once fed on the little creatures are
driven from the area in their search for food.
   Proposals to save freshwater mussels and clams in the United
States have ranged from federal import taxes on pearls, mussel
harvest quotas, shorter shelling seasons and a ban on exporting raw
shells. But the solution most exciting to Sparks is creation of
river sanctuaries for endangered mussels.
   Seven sites along the Illinois side of the Mississippi River
have been proposed as sanctuaries, where scientists would have
unrestricted access to study mussels and clams.
   ``Sanctuaries are urgently needed on the Mississippi River,''
Sparks says. ``We have several endangered species which we must
save.''
   But Latendresse is not impressed with the sanctuary idea.
   ``Several states have created sanctuaries, but they don't follow
up with research funds to study the mussels so the sanctuaries are
worthless,'' he says. ``There's so much money to be made, the
shellers harvest them out of the sanctuaries.''

   The zonies and zdonks are sure bets, but
the aoudads were nothing but trouble, says a man who wants to make
a business out of exotic livestock.
   ``Believe me, away from here it's a good business. I just hope
to make it a good business here,'' said farmer Glawson Gantt.
   Gantt makes his living selling ordinary horses, cattle and
donkeys on his north Louisiana farm. But he expects to expand his
line within the next year.
   The 57-year-old entrepreneur, who already had buffaloes, llamas,
buzzards, peacocks and pheasants on his farm, bought two zebra
stallions at an exotic animal auction and plans to breed them to
his donkeys and Shetland ponies. The resulting animals will be
zdonks and zonies, Gantt said.
   ``Don't just everybody want a zebra,'' Gantt said recently.
``They're mean as Satan and if you take out after them there isn't
a fence that can hold them. But you mix them with a donkey or
Shetland pony and what you get is as sweet as can be.''
   The half-Shetland pony hybrid will sell for $1,500, the
donkey-zebra cross will go for up to $3,500, Gantt said.
   Although you won't find these animals in the dictionary, the
crossbreeding of zebras to donkeys and horses has been done for
years, said David Anderson, curator at the Audubon Zoo in New
Orleans. Zoos consider the resulting animals nothing but
curiosities, he said.
   Gantt already has had success with his bobbydoes. The half
sheep, half goat can sell for up to $600. He had less luck when he
was given some aoudads, a type of African sheep with long, curved
horns.
   ``They're kind of goat-looking things and can jump 16-foot
fences,'' he said. ``We couldn't keep ours penned up. As far as I
know they're still running wild out in the woods.
   ``I keep waiting to hear about some hunter shooting a creature
that nobody can identify, but I guess they can't catch up with them
either.''

<HEAD>Federal Study: Global Warming Could Help Bass, Limit Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Such fish as bass and lake trout would
flourish in Michigan, and the Great Lakes' shipping season would
lengthen if the greenhouse effect warms the Earth a few degrees, a
major federal study says.
   The ice season on Lake Superior would be shortened by one month
to three months, and on Lake Erie by two mohths to three months,
increasing shipping seasons there, said an unreleased Environmental
Protection Agency study that is to be submitted to the Congress in
December.
   The Associated Press obtained a draft of a summary of the
effects of global warming, which is caused by a growing
concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in
the atmosphere.
   The gases that cause the greenhouse effect are produced mainly
by the industries that have spread around the world since the
mid-19th century. Auto exhausts also contribute to the effect.
   While shipping could benefit, the higher temperatures likely
would reduce the snow pack in the Great Lakes region and increase
evaporation. That combination would reduce lake levels, possibly
necessitating dredging ports and channels, the study said.
   The water level of Lake Superior, on average, would be 1\ feet
to 1{ feet lower than now, and Lake Michigan's water level would
fall dramatically by 3 feet to 8 feet, the study said.
   The EPA study also said Michigan's hardwood forests might be
replaced by savannas and grasslands because of the greenhouse
effect, which would open Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Michigan
to increased cultivation.
   The decline of the northern forests would become evident in 30
years to 60 years, the study said.
   The result by the middle of the 21st century will be an average
global temperature of three degrees to eight degrees Fahrenheit
higher than now, most scientists believe.
   ``Northern hardwood forests in Michigan may be reduced to oak
savannas or grasslands, and mixed boreal and northern hardwood
forests in northern Minnesota may become all northern hardwoods,''
the study said.
   The reduction in forests and increased cultivation in the north
could increase erosion and runoff, harming water quality, the study
said.
   And while some fish would thrive, a greater temperature
difference between the surface of the lakes and their depths might
reduce the amount of oxygen in the lower levels and disrupt the
annual turnover of the water, the study said.
   Fish species in shallow lakes and rivers could suffer from the
higher temperatures, the study said.
   A political effect of global warming might be increased demands
for a diversion of Great Lakes water for use outside the region,
the study said.

I couldn't be sure how many were out there. They had just shaken me from a deep 
sleep, a herd of cavorting hippopotamuses bellowing like out-of-tune tubas as 
they blundered and splashed in the dark waters a hundred feet from my tent. 
</P>
<P>
No one had said anything about camping with hippos, I thought as I listened to 
their midnight mirth on the shore of Lake Baringo. I lay awake most of the 
night, tracking their sounds through my canvas tent and waiting to sidle into 
the darkness to the distant latrine. But even when the revelry subsided and the 
camp seemed calm, the snorts and grunts of a lone hippo grazing between the 
tents kept me stranded inside. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finally left the tent, the African sun was burning through the 
dawn clouds. The hippos were back in the lake resting, only their heads poked 
through the water, brown bumps peeping at the shore. We eight campers peered 
back, shaking our heads in awe and amusement at our obnoxious neighbors. I 
walked toward the lake to get a closer look. Two hippos yawned, showing 
cavernous, pink mouths. Others paddled closer, then circled out in single file 
and disappeared into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Camping," a friend said as we walked back to our tents, "is the only way to 
see Africa." 
</P>
<P>
That's the sentiment that convinced me to go camping for the first time. Until 
then, my idea of roughing it had been staying at a motel without an ice 
machine. But as our group reached the halfway point on a two-week camping 
safari through Kenya's most popular lakes and game parks in the summer of last 
year, I couldn't imagine better accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are more comfortable ways to go on safari. One can see 
elephants grazing or lions playing in the high grass as easily from a lodge as 
from a campsite. But to fully experience the world beyond a minibus window, 
camping is authentically best. The sound of a hyena prowling outside your tent 
wraps you in the romance and reality of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The snow-covered peak of Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro loomed through a sheath of 
clouds like a celestial being. On the blazing plain below, a bearded wildebeest 
scampered before a dozen grazing zebras, darting and leaping in a lunatic 
dance. A jackal ran ahead of the bus, then dived into the brush. A small herd 
of elephants grazed near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
We had just arrived in Amboseli National Park after a four-hour trek on the 
dusty, pockmarked roads from Nairobi. Our guide, Joseph, sat amused in the 
driver's seat, politely jerking the minibus to a stop with each oohhh and aahhh 
from behind. "We will get much closer to the animals," he said. "Are you sure?" 
someone asked. "Yes, yes. I am sure. Trust me," he said, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
A 30ish member of the Kikuyu tribe with extensive knowledge of the game parks, 
Joseph not only tracked animals but maneuvered the minibus to within a few feet 
of fighting elephants and feeding lions. Amboseli, one of Kenya's smallest game 
parks, is famous for its herds of wildebeests, Burchell's zebras, water 
buffaloes, gazelles and a handful of the endangered rhinoceroses, but it's the 
elephants that seize the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the elephants have been heavily poached for their ivory during the 
last decade, the gray giants seemed to be everywhere in Amboseli. They grazed 
in herds numbering from a few individuals to a few hundred, always with 
sentries posted for their only predator, man. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside our minibus, a calf tried to filch a bunch of grass that another calf 
had shaken free of dirt. A bull inexplicably dropped to its front knees and 
kicked its hind legs like a circus performer. Two juveniles squared off in 
play, their trunks entwined, one driving the other like a sumo wrestler into 
our shadow. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk we drove to our campsite, marked by a stone in a cluster of thorn trees 
surrounded by the the dusty plain. 
</P>
<P>
This is the no-frills camp. Those wishing more pampered treatment can choose 
from several luxury tour operators who offer campsites with permanent tents and 
private baths, meals served on fine china and good wines. But we were 
comfortable enough in our rickety abodes, sleeping in bags on thin foam 
mattresses and dining on staples -- lots of bread, cheese and fresh fruit. The 
cost was about $1,200 each. 
</P>
<P>
Our first night in the bush was cool and quiet; it surprised me. I expected the 
night to be more menacing and claustrophobic. The cook managed a good meal of 
pasta, potatoes and beans on a fire that brought our group together under the 
sparkling canopy of the Southern Hemisphere. Over drinks, we traded stories of 
travels and careers, and drifted into the darkness to our tents. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few days our routine was to drive in the morning to view 
wildlife and return in the heat of the day to camp, some to sit at the shaded 
table to read or write letters, while others washed clothes or napped. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon I followed the sounds of laughter from my tent to the edge of 
camp, where three young Masai herdsmen leaned against a minibus, talking with a 
few of our group. They wore traditional red cloth, tied like a toga over their 
lanky frames. Elaborate red and yellow earrings dangled from their spool-sized 
lobes. Their hair, braided and matted with red ocher and fat, stained the backs 
of their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of them let us examine his weapons. He appeared to be in his 20s, 
but no one was sure -- years are not counted by the Masai. We touched the sword 
and spear he used to protect his cattle from predators. The Masai protect their 
herds fiercely, for not only do they measure their worth in cattle, they live 
on milk and blood drawn from living cows. 
</P>
<P>
We spent two more hours together. They were intrigued by our jewelry, cameras 
and sunglasses. Then they returned to the bush to watch their cattle graze 
under the high sun. We went back to writing and reading about the people of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in Amboseli, we headed north through the lush forests and 
grasslands of Mt. Kenya, then out on the plains to the Samburu Game Reserve. We 
set up camp on the sandy banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro, a muddy oasis amid a 
parched landscape of desert scrub and savanna that's home to a range of 
wildlife. It's one of the few places in Kenya to see the reticulated giraffe 
and the Grevey's zebra, together with Marabou storks, gazelles, dik-dik and 
gerenuk (varieties of antelope), and, of course, vultures. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu brought home the usual risks of camping: a snake near the latrine, 
warnings of scorpions and of crocodiles. An unusual risk, too: "There has been 
some trouble with Sudanese refugees," our guide said as he explained why two 
guards armed with machine guns had been hired to patrol the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Sudan was 300 miles from our camp, an unlikely source of danger. Only after our 
return to the United States did the reason become clear: In July, 1989, 
poachers and bandits were believed to have slain five tourists, including a 
Connecticut woman, in the game parks. Since then the Kenyan government has 
stepped up patrols and instituted a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. The 
U.S. State Department currently says security has "improved markedly" but 
cautions against solo camping. 
</P>
<P>
We moved west from Samburu to Lake Baringo in Kenya's lake region in the scar 
of the Rift Valley. The rough roads carried us slowly through the late-morning 
bustle of small villages. A man, twirling a blade of grass in his teeth, walked 
his bicycle past a woman balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. Outside 
the villages, herdsmen pushed their goats and cows through the valley fields. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous of the Rift Valley lakes is Lake Nakuru, where, in one of the 
world's greatest bird spectacles, 2 million flamingos gather in alkaline waters 
to feast on its algae. 
</P>
<P>
One sees a bustle of pink and white as the birds skittishly preen, feed, honk 
and flap. Their spindly necks and legs belie the gracefulness they reach in the 
air, black-spotted wings and outstretched bodies in effortless flight which 
concludes with a running splash in the shallow waters. 
</P>
<P>
The national park at Lake Nakuru pales in comparison with the others; we saw 
only a few water bucks and oryxes there. But, as with the hippos at Lake 
Baringo, the best wildlife encounters took place at the campsite. As we set up 
camp under the tall acacias, water bucks grazed in the lush green grass, dozens 
of Vervet monkeys skittered about and a handful of baboons retreated to the 
bushes behind our tents. 
</P>
<P>
At night a group of bush pigs crashed through the food tent, bumbling in the 
dark through the cans and pots. The cook screamed to scare them off, and a few 
of us laughed as he muttered about his sleepless night. 
</P>
<P>
We left the Rift Valley -- and the only campsites with showers and toilets -- 
for three days in Masai Mara, the largest and last game park on our safari. The 
Masai Mara Game Reserve ranges over 974 square miles that adjoin the Serengeti 
Plain of Tanzania and is famous for the more than 1 million wildebeests and 
thousands of zebras, gazelles and antelopes that migrate there once a year. 
</P>
<P>
We found instead a smattering of gazelles, giraffes, topi and anxious predators 
amid an Edenic landscape of grassy plains and acacia trees. 
</P>
<P>
A male lion, his ribs showing through an emaciated body, moved slowly along the 
plain. The wind rustled his black mane. Behind him, in the golden camouflage of 
the savanna, three lionesses licked and nuzzled their cubs as they grappled for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, five giraffes marched in a row, heads bobbing in unison. Shafts 
of light broke through a low cumulus canopy onto hundreds of Thomsen's gazelles 
as they grazed. 
</P>
<P>
These and other images that unfolded during the next three days enraptured me 
as we crisscrossed the vast Masai Mara. Even the driving rainstorm that 
shortened our last game drive and toppled my tent left me secured by this 
noble, pristine landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It was our last night on safari. The rain had soaked my tent and sleeping bag 
and left me only a small spot to sit on. I waited for the storm to end, 
remembering a conversation I had with a Kikuyu merchant at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you like our country?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite beautiful," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but it is only beautiful to the foreigner," he said. "To us it's only 
very poor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the realities of Kenya -- the potholes of its capital, the poaching of 
its wildlife -- belie much of the land's romance. Some of us carried Karen 
Blixen books and other adventure stories to help us imagine a world long gone. 
</P>
<P>
But as we drove through Masai Mara for the final time, a shared, primeval 
heritage still seemed to beat on these vast plains. It was quiet and empty and 
I watched the bus tracks dissolve in the grass. I wished to see a giraffe or 
gazelle for the last time, but there was nothing, only a solitary, crooked 
acacia twitching in the wind.

<LEADPARA>  With the help of the drought, the tiny, audacious Asian clam has taken over
northern San Francisco Bay and is advancing south, stripping the water of
nutrients and wrecking whole ecosystems.;    Scientists hope the eventual end
of the drought will stem the invasion, which started in 1986.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But they are not optimistic. The Asian clam, it turns out, is a fierce
competitor and a near-perfect feeding machine that will risk its life for a
good meal.;    It has a "very daring lifestyle for a clam," said Janet
Thompson, a biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park who has been
tracking the creature's steamroller spread down the bay.;    "They're very
well-adapted," she added. "If I were to go and design a clam, this would be
it.";    The diminutive Potamocorbula amurensis, just over an inch long, was
flushed into Carquinez Strait in the ballast water of a ship five years ago.
Since researchers had been monitoring the area's bottom-dwelling animals for
more than a decade, they noticed the invasion right away.;    It was not the
first time a new species had hitchhiked from across the world; most of the
bay's bottom-dwellers are imported, said Frederic H. Nichols, a biological
oceanographer with the USGS.;    But it was one of the most successful. Within
a year, it had taken over Suisun and San Pablo bays and was heading south,
where it has set up thriving colonies along the east shore of the bay and in
deep shipping channels between the San Mateo and Dumbarton bridges.;    The
clam had an unwitting ally in the strange weather patterns of the past few
years, Nichols told a meeting of the Geological Society of America on
Wednesday in San Francisco.;    Starting in 1984, he said, drought dried up
river flows into the North Bay, turning the water saltier and encouraging
growth of salt-loving species.;    But in early 1986, a rainy spell flooded
the area with fresh water, wiping out the salt-lovers almost overnight, he
said. Just then, the Asian clam arrived, proliferating so quickly that the
other species had no chance to make a comeback.;    While the clam has thrived
in the salty conditions of the continuing drought, lab tests indicate that
it's just as happy to live in fresh water, dampening scientists' hopes that it
will disappear when the drought ends and rivers run high again.;    "But
Mother Nature does things we don't do" in the lab, Thompson said. "When the
drought breaks, we'll know.";    Asian clams are fast and efficient feeders.
In Suisun Bay, they filter enough water every day to fill the bay, straining
out the tiny floating organisms that make up the base of the food chain and
dramatically changing the ecology.;    Diving ducks and sturgeon are feasting
on the invaders, biologists said. But striped bass and other fish may suffer
for lack of food, although right now it's hard to distinguish the effects of
the clam invasion from those of the drought.;    Thompson has developed a
grudging admiration for the creatures as she follows their spread into the
South Bay.;    So far, they show no sign of taking over there, she said,
possibly because the bottom is already covered with a thick, thriving
community of clams, worms and crustaceans.;    But Thompson said the clams'
lifestyle makes them formidable, and it will take at least six more months of
monitoring to determine how far they are likely to spread.;    The clams
settle on the bottom in the middle of the fastest currents and anchor
themselves with protein fibers, similar to the "beards" of mussels, stuck far
into the mud or sand.;    While other clams play it safe, burying themselves
in the mud to hide from predators, the Asian clams poke boldly out into the
water and stretch out their siphons to suck in the maximum amounts of water
and food.  </TEXT>

FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US copper project defeats
ecological mussel-power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most bitterly fought battles between environmentalists and miners
enters a new phase next month when work re-starts on the Dollars 20m
development of Flambeau Mining's copper project in Wisconsin.
The hugely-rich but relatively small deposit, now owned by RTZ, the world's
biggest mining group, was first found in 1968 but it was not until last year
that all the permits were in place for development which began in August.
Then environmental researchers successfully applied to a US judge for work
to be halted because they said purple warty back mussels and other
threatened or endangered species were found in the Flambeau River about a
mile from where the mining company plans a drain pipe outlet.
Mr Larry Mercando, vice president and general manager of Flambeau Mining,
said yesterday that Wisconsin's state Department of Natural Resources had
now issued a revised environmental impact statement that clearly stated the
mine's operations would have no effect on any threatened or endangered
species.
The episode had delayed mining by about six months, he added. First ore
should be shipped in June, 1993. However, Mr Mercando admitted: 'We are
ready and prepared for more attacks by environmentalists. They never give
up.'
Mr Mercando estimates that about 70 per cent of the Dollars 20m-Dollars 30
cost of the mine will go towards environmental protection measures - the
biggest cost is for a water treatment plant to ensure that water discarded
by the mine is more pure than any found in nature.
The recent production delay was caused by a civil action against the state
department by the Sierra Club, a group of environmental activists, and the
Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa natives, who say the mine
could spoil fishing by polluting the Flambeau River, a tributary of the
Chippewa, which drains into the Mississippi.
Environmentalists are also concerned because the copper deposit is in a
heavily wooded area with is no industrial activity. Flambeau's will be the
first mine to be developed in Wisconsin since the Shullsburg lead-zinc mine
closed in 1979.
Kennecott Corporation, now an RTZ subsidiary, has owned the deposit for 20
years and persevered because it is exceptionally rich. The ore contains 10.5
per cent of copper whereas most miners would be happy with 2 or 3 per cent.
Unfortunately, there is only about 1.9m tonnes of ore. As this will be dug
out at the rate of 320,000 tonnes a year, the mine will have a life of only
six years.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Eagles fly again above the Great Lakes, but they
are dying faster than they can reproduce. The majestic birds are
victims of high levels of the same poisons that wiped them out of
the area 20 years ago.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<DATELINE>WELLSTON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two decades after the oily
Cuyahoga River caught fire, after Lake Erie was declared dead and
DDT was banned, eagles again soar above the Great Lakes.
   They are not doing well.
   Yearly, they return to try to colonize the contaminated
shoreline. And yearly, scientist Bill Bowerman climbs to their
nests to remove the unhatched eggs.
   In the dead embryos and in the blood of surviving eaglets, the
Michigan State University researcher sees high levels of the same
poisons that wiped eagles out of the Great Lakes 20 years ago.
   The birds are dying faster than they can reproduce, Bowerman
says. For them and more than a dozen other animals that feed on
Great Lakes fish, the shore is a zone of death and deformity.
   It's a red flag warning, Bowerman says, ``a sign of what's
happening to everything in the food chain.''
   The bald eagle is a perfect example, said Conservation
Foundation researcher Dr. Theodore Colborn in Washington, D.C.
   Up and down the inland sea, from cold, deep Lake Superior to the
roiling St. Lawrence River, wildlife scientists tell of shore birds
born with twisted beaks, clubfeet and stomachs outside their
bodies. They tell of whales wracked with cancers and diseases, of
expanses of beach where mink have vanished, and of eagles that can
barely reproduce.
   In a report to the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission
last year, Colborn listed 16 predator species whose shoreline
populations have dropped in association with high toxin levels.
   The killer is silent. Pesticides such as DDT, mirex and dieldrin
and toxins such as PCBs and dioxin persist in the mucky lake
sediments despite 20 years of cleanup efforts.
   The toxins are picked up by worms and leeches and travel up the
food chain, from smelt to trout to gulls to eagles. The
concentrations of poisons increase 10 times at each level.
   Contamination levels vary from lake to lake, but there are
basin-wide warnings for humans to limit the sizes and kinds of
Great Lakes fish they eat.
   Fish contamination in some areas has dropped because of controls
and bans on toxins pumped into the lakes by industry. Researchers
say it will be a century or two before the vast lakes shed the
poisons they have absorbed.
   Meanwhile, the eagles try to return.
   Bowerman's research shows Michigan eagles on lakes Michigan and
Huron are reproducing at less than half the rate of those who nest
inland.
   A pair must raise one chick a year to keep the population
stable. Lake Huron eagles have one chick for every three nests.
After five years of eating Great Lakes fish _ the time when inland
birds reach their reproductive peak _ shore bird reproduction in
Michigan falls to one chick for every seven nests.
   Wisconsin's only Lake Michigan eagle nest, near Green Bay, has
not produced a chick in four years. Another pair on the Straits of
Mackinac near St. Ignace has not produced a chick in eight years.
   In the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's untamed Upper
Peninsula, prime eagle territory, seven shoreline eagle pairs went
three years before one of them produced a chick this year.
   The eagle has made a remarkable comeback inland. Michigan, with
150 inland nesting pairs, has surpassed its federally set goal of
140 pairs. Minnesota reports 390 inland pairs and Wisconsin has
336, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the three
states, the eagle is classified as threatened, not endangered.
   Bowerman believes that as those healthy eagles fly to the shore,
their stunted efforts to reproduce are sapping the entire
population.
   There are no nests on Lake Ontario, the most contaminated of the
Great Lakes. The Canadian side of Lake Huron is barren. Five of the
eight U.S. Great Lakes states _ Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
New York and Minnesota _ have no eagles on their shores.
   ``There's some beautiful land there,'' Bowerman said. ``I don't
know why. I don't know what the flow is from the pulp mills in
Canada. I don't know where it's all coming from.''
   He lost nine nests on Lake Superior this year. The parent birds
have vanished.
   Tim Kubiak of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Lansing said the
eagles' problems are a sign of the poor health of the entire Great
Lakes basin, the world's largest freshwater system.
   ``Growth problems, retardation, smaller head sizes, lower birth
rates ... we see it in mink, the birds,'' Kubiak said. They are
clues to the health of shore-dwelling humans.
   The toxic problems show no signs of abating.
   This spring, a research team found 22 deformities in cormorant
chicks in Wisconsin's Green Bay colony _ a deformity rate of 1 in
72 where 1 in 10,000 would be the norm.
   Last year, Bowerman tested a Saginaw Bay eaglet with 2.25 parts
per million of PCBs in its blood. The 5-week-old Lake Huron chick
carried contamination 100 times higher than inland eaglets.
   Like other Great Lakes researchers of terns and whales and mink,
Bowerman is unable to say what the toxins actually do inside the
bodies of their subjects.
   ``We're seeing messages from the environment, indications that
there are problems,'' New York biologist Robert Foley said. His
work shows elevated PCB concentrations in Lake Ontario mink _ when
he can find them. He thinks the toxins and the population problems
are related, but he has yet to prove it.
   Eight years of analyzing the blubber of dead beluga whales
beached in the St. Lawrence River have given Canadian researcher
Pierre Beland a chemical catalog of the lakes.
   The dead whales' ailments run an odd list of cancers and
diseases previously unseen in belugas. Yet Beland cannot explain
what is happening to the living whales. Why do some of them have
bent spines? Why are St. Lawrence belugas failing to recover
despite a ban on commercial hunting?
   ``We're simply hoping the population will hold out until things
get cleaner,'' he said.

<TEXT>     Sixteen assault victims and relatives and supporters of murder victims
attended Tuesday's hearings. Scott said seven spoke against parole for Moore
and three made statements against releasing Cooks.;    Fourteen white people
were killed and eight others injured during the series of attacks that
panicked San Francisco residents during the winter of 1973-74. The victims
were shot, stabbed and, in the case of one woman, beheaded with a machete.;   
The slayings were dubbed the "Zebra" killings because police used a separate
Z, or Zebra, radio band during their investigation of the slayings.  </TEXT>
