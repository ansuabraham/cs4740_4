   Christopher Columbus could have told them
it wouldn't be easy.
   Ninety Spaniards sailing in exact replicas of Columbus' three
ships, the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, departed from this
southwestern Atlantic port Friday on a six-month Mediterranean sea
trial.
   But by Saturday, the explorers, who are preparing for a planned
1992 re-creation of Columbus' voyage to the New World, found
themselves back in port after they were blown to land by a
windstorm.
   Undaunted, Spanish navy Capt. Santiago Bolivar, the leader of
the mission, told reporters Saturday: ``We're going to wait out the
winds before starting out again for our first destination.'' That
destination is Almeria, a southwestern Spanish port roughly 310
miles east of Huelva.
   The ships' joyful sendoff Friday coincided with the 498th
anniversary of the day Columbus began his first voyage to what
would become known as America.
   Spain, which bankrolled Columbus, spent $2 million to build the
three ships from Galician pine and oak from the Pyrenees.
   The ships were built to help promote the Expo '92 World's Fair
in the southern city of Seville and to commemorate the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' legendary voyage.
   Expo '92 is expected to attract 20 million visitors to Seville
from April to October 1992.
   While the sailors will attempt to follow the exact sailing
methods of Columbus and his intrepid men, the ships are equipped
with sophisticated equipment to navigate via satellite and carry
modern-day lighting.

   Replicas of the ships that accompanied
Christopher Columbus on his Atlantic crossing have set sail, but
this time in search of tourist dollars instead of precious metals
and spices.
   The Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria on Friday began their six-month
voyage to a dozen Spanish ports to prepare for a 1992 re-enactment
of Columbus' trip to the New World.
   The ships have a total of 90 crew members and all but the
commander, a Spanish navy captain, will sleep outdoors, as
Columbus' crew did on the voyage to America.
   Like Columbus, Capt. Santiago Bolivar will lead from the deck of
the Santa Maria, the flagship.
   ``The objective of the 1992 voyage will be to study in action
the navigation methods of the 15th century and the effectiveness of
Columbus' sailing methods,'' Bolivar, 40, told reporters.
   The 15th century Spanish royalty bankrolled Columbus.
   Today's government spent $2 million to build the three replica
ships from Galician pine and oak from the Pyrenees. They sailed
from this southern port _ 310 miles southwest of Madrid _ 498 years
to the day of Columbus' first voyage to the New World.
   The head of the government company planning the 1992
celebrations, Luis Yanez, saw them off and laid a wreath at a
monument to Columbus.
   Yanez said the ships were built to help promote the Expo '92
World's Fair in the southern city of Seville. Expo '92 is expected
to attract 20 million visitors to Seville from April to October
1992.
   ``An Expo such as this one is a unique occasion to launch a
country's image around the world,'' the exposition's commissioner,
Manuel Olivencia, has said.
   At least 105 countries and 20 international organizations have
signed commitments to build pavilions in Seville to display their
newest technologies and designs.
   The ships aren't the only promotion for Expo '92. A promotional
quiz game that cost $707,000 to develop is to begin running soon in
Spanish newspapers to familiarize Spaniards with the discoveries of
the past 500 years.
   The government is also pumping an estimated $1 billion into Expo
'92 to modernize Seville's public works communications systems and
$6 billion into the rest of the southern region of Andalusia.
   The ships are a particular point of pride. Last year, Queen
Sofia christened the single-decked 117-foot-long Santa Maria. Her
daughter, Princess Elena, christened the Nina and Princess Cristina
the Pinta.
   The two smaller caravelles are 50 feet long.
   While the sailors will attempt to follow the exact sailing
methods of Columbus, the ships are equipped with sophisticated
equipment to navigate via satellite and carry modern-day lighting.
   For protection, a navy frigate will escort them.

<MEMO>  The Great Columbus Chase
Second in a four-part series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Up on a wall next to the Church of St. George in this small, sunny town in
southwestern Spain is this bold proclamation, set in blue tile:;    "Oh,
Palos! Your glory cannot be equaled. Not even Memphis. Not even Thebes. Not
even immortal Rome. Not even Athens. Not even London. No city can dispute your
historical fame!";    After all that puffy back-patting, it was natural the
citizenry would throw up a statue or two to commemorate their self-designated
place in history, and indeed, they did.;    So, there is a statue here of the
man who discovered America, but it ain't that Italian upstart, Cristobol
Colon. Nope, it's a statue of  Martin Alonso Pinzon, captain of the Pinta
(yeah, that Pinta) and a hometown boy who, they tell you in these parts, made
good but never got the credit.;    And on a brilliant whitewashed house next
to the old church is a colorful portrait, also in tile, of Vicente Yanez
Pinzon, Martin Alonso's kid brother and the captain of the Nina (yeah, that
Nina). The folks in Palos say that Vicente, who was made captain-general and
corregidor (head of state) of Puerto Rico, also discovered Brazil and the
mouth of the Amazon River.;    Palos and the Church of St. George were central
in the saga of the Columbus voyage.;    Columbus, after years of hanging
around the court of Isabella and Ferdinand, finally got the two sovereigns to
back his trip. But, never a couple to spend a peseta unnecessarily, the royal
pair decided on a little end-around run.;    The sailors of Palos -- including
the Pinzons -- had long experience at sea, trading in Africa and the Azores.
Right after they promised Columbus three ships, the king and queen dug up an
old case involving some African goods imported to Palos without royal duty
being paid.;    The fine for this forgotten infraction was -- guess what --
two ships, ready to sail and loaded with enough stuff to last a year. (Why pay
for three ships, they figured, when we can stiff the good people of Palos for
two of them? Were these two good, or what?);    The taxpayers of Palos were
thus forced to pay for their part in history. The two ships in question were,
of course, the Nina and the Pinta. You can guess how popular Columbus was when
he arrived in town with that news. The royal order was issued in May -- and
somehow, the ships were provisioned and ready for sea by August.;    Columbus
and the elder Pinzon had known each other off and on for years. Near Palos is
the monastery of La Rabida, where Columbus spent several years plotting how to
get Ferdinand and Isabella to give him an ear, and some historians say Martin
Alonso was in on the planning.;    And it seems unlikely that without Pinzon
going to bat for him, Columbus would ever have convinced the neighborhood
sailors to wander off toward the edge of the Earth -- especially with a
foreigner.;    And it's pretty obvious, looking back, that Palos and other
nearby villages were part of the scheme from the start. The Pinzons and dozens
of other experienced sailors were on tap, the Pinta and the Nina were already
there and the town was well placed on a little backwater on the Rio Tinto, a
wide river that opens into the sea a few miles from town.;    Relationship
turns icy;    On the night of Aug. 2, 1492, Columbus, the Pinzons and the rest
of the crews went to the Church of St. George in Palos for Mass, then filed
down a set of stairs next to the church to where the three ships were
anchored, and boarded. They sailed the next morning.;    There's little left
today of the anchorage. The small arm of water that connected Palos to the Rio
Tinto is long-since silted up, and the only evidence that a wharf ever existed
is a memorial marker and a bit of stone wall.;    It was after the three ships
arrived in the New World that things apparently got fairly icy between
Columbus and Martin Alonso. One historian says Columbus was constantly afraid
that Pinzon would discover gold before he did (the Pinta sailed a good deal
faster than the tubby Santa Maria). And toward the middle of their exploration
of Cuba, the Pinta -- and Pinzon -- disappeared for two months. Desertion?
Miscalculation? Gold fever? Who knows?;    Reneging on a deal;    The Columbus
fleet, minus the Santa Maria, which hit a reef on Christmas Day, returned to
Palos in triumph in March 1493. There were, by all reports, huge parties.
Martin Alonso Pinzon did not attend. Five days after he returned to Palos, he
died.;    In later years, Isabella and Ferdinand tried to renege on pre-voyage
payment deals they had made with Columbus. One of the strategies they used was
trying to prove that the whole idea -- sailing west to the Indies -- was the
brainchild of Martin Alonso Pinzon and his family. This started suits and
counter-suits that went on for centuries.;    It also created the stubborn
pride of the people of Palos, who for five centuries have said the wrong man
got the credit. Italian author Gianni Granzotto, in his rather biased 1984
biography of Columbus, suggests that the statue of Martin Alonso is
chauvinistic and "clouds the issue.";    "Fame does not make mistakes," he
writes. "Five centuries after the fact, the name of Christopher Columbus still
resounds throughout the world. . . . How many people have heard of Pinzon?
Time has buried him, swallowed him up. . . . There (is) a great distance
between him and Columbus, the distance between obscurity and glory.";    So in
the end Martin Alonso lost. Not only did he die before the full impact of the
voyage was realized, but he also disappeared into history, just a footnote to
the Columbus myth. Except, of course, in Palos de la Frontera, whose "glory
cannot be equaled.";    The best thing now that can be said for Palos is that
it's close to the Portuguese border and the attractions of the Algarve. If
you're passing by this way, say howdy to Martin Alonso and his kid brother,
look at the church, then drive like a bat for the border.;    Today, Palos
sits in a bowl of pollution from refineries and factories on both sides of the
Rio Tinto. There is another refinery on the coast near La Rabida, and Columbus
would have trouble steering his small ships out to sea because of the haze.
The monastery (which now has a bar and restaurant on the grounds) is, like
almost every other Columbus site in Spain, closed for repairs, but will be
open again in time for the grand celebration next year.;    And if you're
smart, and happen to be in Palos along about August of 1992, you'll forget all
about Columbus and the ocean blue and 1492 and all that pastafazool -- and
remember who really discovered the New World.; NEXT WEEK: Columbus returned in
glory to Barcelona after his epic first voyage. He wouldn't recognize the
place now -- and probably couldn't even get out of town. Good luck, 1992
Olympics.; If you go. . .; FOR general information about southwestern

<TEXT>     That much, we know, is true. Somebody named Christopher Columbus, or
Cristoforo Colombo (the Italian version) or Cristobal Colon (the Spanish
spelling), did sail from a tiny port in southern Spain on Aug. 3, 1492, cross
the Atlantic, land somewhere in the Bahamas, then return to spread the word
that a new world awaited those who embraced God, glory and gold.;    His
diaries exist. The logs of his journeys to the Americas exist. We know where
he died and have some idea where he might be buried. We also have some
indication that he was no saint or selfless explorer, as generations of
American school kids have been taught. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest he
was greedy, malicious, conniving and a cheat. (See accompanying article by
Nora Villagran.);    Whatever, Spain is getting very excited about 1992 and
the quincentennial of the Columbus voyage. Barcelona is holding the summer
Olympic Games and Seville is holding the 1992 Expo. Both events will be
heavily laced with Columbus celebrations. Italy is also gearing up for a fete
or two to honor its native son, especially in his home town of Genoa.;    But
the celebrations are not confined to Europe. From San Jose to Columbus, Ohio;
from Toronto to Miami, there are events planned all next year to honor the man
who officially (if not factually) discovered America, though he's several
parts enigma.;    His legacy is uncertain, his contributions unclear. But he
has left footprints all over Europe.;    Following those footprints adds
little to the truth about the man -- but the footprints do take you to some
interesting spots.;    Over the next several weeks, from Genoa to Barcelona,
from Granada to a tiny monastery in the pollution-clouded Rio Tinto valley,
we'll chase Columbus around his old haunts, 499 years after he stepped aboard
the Santa Maria and sailed off to immortality.;    One of the big mysteries
about Columbus has always been where he was born. The Italians insist he was
born in Genoa about 1451, the son of Domenico Colombo and Susanna
Fontanarossa. His father, so one version goes, was a wool merchant and weaver
who caught the eye of the doge of Genoa and was made gatekeeper of the
Olivella Gate.;    Another version has him being a Jew born in Spain; another,
that he was non-Jewish, born in Spain.;    Or, even, would you believe,
Norwegian? Tor Borch Sannes, a Norwegian researcher of maritime history, says
in a new book that Columbus was born in the small community of Hyen in
Nordsfjord in western Norway. He was named Christopher Bonde, a Norwegian name
meaning "farmer," but called himself Christopher Colon -- after "colonus," the
Latin word for farmer.;    The Bonde family, so this version goes, was
involved with the royal families of Sweden and Norway and left Norway for
Genoa in the 15th century because of conflicts between the two royal
families.;    The Scandinavians have always been miffed that Columbus gets all
the publicity for discovering the Western Hemisphere, citing fairly convincing
evidence that Viking sailors explored the New World around the year 1000,
almost 500 years before Columbus sailed. (Stephen Birnbaum discusses this
issue, Page 2T.);    Italian historian Gianni Granzotto, in a 1984 biography,
says Columbus began his sailing career as a boy, perhaps as young as 13,
accompanying wool shipments belonging to his father.;    Off to sea;    In
1476, according to American historian Samuel Eliot Morison, a Genoese convoy
Columbus was with was attacked by a Franco-Portuguese war fleet of about a
dozen vessels, and Columbus was wounded in the battle. He escaped his sinking
ship and managed to swim and cling to an oar until he reached the shore of
Portugal near Lagos.;    He apparently was not taken prisoner, because the
next year he sailed to Iceland and then moved back to Lisbon to take up work
as a chart maker and sailor.;    Granzotto opines that it was a move of
fateful consequence, because Genoa offered little incentive for
world-exploring voyages. Portugal, on the other hand, was by this time a
center for maritime studies, and its explorers were at the forefront of the
epic voyages of discovery.;    After about eight years in Lisbon, plus a
marriage and a number of wide-ranging voyages, the saga now has Columbus
starting his round of visits to the royal courts of Europe, trying to get
monetary backing for a voyage to discover a western route to India.;    Myth
has it that he stood alone in the belief that the world was round, and was
turned down again and again by ignorant nobles unwilling to fight against
traditional geographers.;    In fact, most anybody with an ounce of education
believed by this time that the world was round. What Columbus had to sell was
a new route, one that would be cheaper and more efficient than the overland
routes that had been used for centuries, or the new southern ocean route
around the tip of Africa.;    He first went to the king of Portugal in 1483.
The king, John II, was one of the many Portuguese monarchs who were ardent and
educated supporters of exploration, but he felt the Columbus route was too
uncertain.;    Rejected, Columbus tried next door, in Spain. In 1485, he
arrived at Palos de la Frontera, a tiny port just across the Rio Tinto from
the Portuguese border. Near Palos was the monastery of La Rabida.;    A
devious schemer?;  Those who think Columbus was a devious schemer believe his
arrival in the area was no quirk. At La Rabida were two prelates, Father
Antonio de Marchena and Father Juan Perez.;    De Marchena was a cosmographer,
a man popular at court and a man not ill at ease with the vision of a round
world. And Perez (the plot thickens) was Queen Isabella's personal confessor.;
   By 1486, thanks to the two clergymen, Columbus had been presented at court,
but not to the king and queen. Ferdinand and Isabella were busy kicking the
Moors out of Spain, and the siege of the last major Moorish stronghold,
Granada, was under way. Columbus had to wait until the expulsion was complete
-- a wait that lasted six years.;    In April 1492, the victorious Isabella
met Columbus at the small village of Santa Fe near Granada, one of a series of
meetings the two had over the years. This time, she was ready to support the
scheme.;    But according to Granzotto, Columbus made outrageous demands. In
exchange for royal backing, for example, he wanted 10 percent of all profits
from the new world. He also wanted the title of Admiral of the Open Ocean. The
sovereigns eventually agreed, then later reneged on the deal, starting a
series of lawsuits between the Columbus family and the crown of Spain still
not resolved.;    Isabella did not hock her jewels to pay for the trip, by the
way; her husband, Ferdinand, had to approve all bills, and in this case, the
money came from the royal treasury, and according to historian Morison, from
Columbus himself. The cost to obtain and outfit three ships? Morison says
$14,000.;    Because of crowded conditions in other ports, it was decided that
the voyage would commence from Palos de la Frontera. Isabella, one of
history's darker figures, was a violent anti-Semite who is given credit for
beginning the Spanish Inquisition and for formulating the March 14, 1492,
order for the expulsion of all Jews from Spain.;    ecause of that order, many
southern Spanish ports were filled with refugees; the two sovereigns finally
ordered all ships carrying Jewish exiles to leave port by Aug. 2 -- the day
before Columbus sailed.;    Land Ho!;  It took the three ships -- the immortal
Pinta, Nina and Santa Maria -- more than 40 days to reach the Bahamas
(including a forced layover in the Azores). Ferdinand and Isabella had offered
a lifetime annuity to the first man to spy land in the New World. Granzotto
tells us it was Rodrigo de Triana aboard the Pinta. At 2 a.m., Oct. 12, 1492,
he yelled "Tierra, tierra!" And never got a dime.;    Columbus later claimed
that he was the first to spot land. He said the previous evening, Oct. 11, he
had spotted a candle light on shore. Granzotto, noting that the ships were at
that point about 30 miles offshore, says it would have been impossible to see
the light. "A cruel abuse of power," he calls the action. Columbus kept the
prize.;    Oct. 12 -- Columbus Day in the United States -- he went ashore at
San Salvador Island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain. He and his crew
made the first recorded contact between Europeans and the natives of the New
World -- in this case, apparently, the Arawak Indians.;    Columbus took
several Indians back to Spain with him and presented them at the royal court
in Barcelona.;    Columbus made four more voyages to the new lands but
significantly never really recognized that two major land masses were nearby.;
   He explored many of the islands of the Caribbean (and did step ashore in
what is now Venezuela) but found little gold and no proof at all that he had
discovered a new route to India. His health worsened (he caught malaria, had
gout and arthritis), and worse, the coral and sand islands of his new realm
yielded little that increased his fortunes.;    Royal displeasure;  Ferdinand
and Isabella were less than pleased by these voyages. On one, he lost a whole
fleet. On another, he was forced to deal with a mutiny that eventually saw him
returned to Spain in chains.;    The sovereigns had little to show for their
backing and were more and more reluctant to abide by their contract with
Columbus, especially the part that gave him 10 percent of all the goodies
(such as they were) coming back from the Caribbean. Then his chief ally,
Isabella, died in November 1504, less than a month after his return from the
last voyage.;    He and Ferdinand fought a prolonged battle over what was owed
to whom, a battle that apparently worsened Columbus' already frail health (he
was 53 at the time).;    In the spring of 1505, he moved to Valladolid in
northern Spain, where he died a year later. He died too soon to realize that
his dream of gold and glory was real, and that the new world was more than
sandy, barren islands in the middle of the ocean. Within 15 years, Hernan
Cortes had defeated the Aztecs and by 1532, Juan Pizarro had taken control of
the Inca empire.;    Whether he was a gold-hungry, greedy con artist who sold
a bill of goods to a couple of naive monarchs, or a great mariner and
courageous explorer, continues to be a historic debate even today, almost five
centuries later.;    If Columbus/Colombo/Colon were around today, he might be
pleased to know his name is still widely known. Or he might just fly off to
Madrid to see King Juan Carlos and check on that 10 percent he has coming.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  When he set sail with four small caravels on his final trip to the New World
in 1502, Christopher Columbus expected to find his long-sought shortcut to
Asia and emerge from the disgrace that less than two years before had seen him
stripped of honors and clapped in chains.;    Instead, with two leaking
caravels already abandoned in Panama after a year of perilous wandering, and
the remaining two no longer seaworthy, the ailing 52-year-old admiral and his
mutinous crew barely made it to the beach in this placid bay on the north
coast of Jamaica.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Columbus' misfortune -- shipwrecked here for a year and five days only
"a crossbow shot," as his son phrased it, from a band of hostile Arawak
Indians -- may be a boon to Jamaica and a team of Texas-based marine
archaeologists. They believe they have found the spot where Columbus ran the
two caravels aground 488 years ago.;    "We are 98 percent sure they are
here," said Dr. James M. Parrent of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at
Texas A&amp;M University, who, in cooperation with the government of Jamaica,
first began looking for the Columbus caravels in 1982.;    After starting work
in earnest last summer, Parrent said he hopes soon to unearth the keels and
some of the lower hull planking of the caravels "Capitana" and "Santiago de
Palos" -- all that could be expected to remain after almost five centuries
under the bay's bottom -- for expert study and eventual display in a Jamaica
museum.;    "We are charged with locating perhaps the most important historic
archaeological site in the New World," Parrent said, noting that as the
quincentennial of Columbus' first voyage in 1492 approaches, no other trace
has been found of the ships he sailed.;    They not only will be the oldest
European vessels discovered in the Western Hemisphere and the only ones
actually commanded by Columbus, he said, they also will help solve a simple
question that has plagued naval architects and historians for centuries,
namely: What did a caravel look like?;    The Nina and Pinta -- mainstays of
Columbus' first voyage, the Spanish-underwritten expedition that launched him
into Western lore as the finder of America -- were fast-sailing caravels that
he preferred over the larger, more lumbering Santa Maria. Yet no reliable
drawing, painting or naval architect's plan of any of the vessels ever has
been found.;    Although divers have uncovered remains of other 16th-century
vessels thought to be similar to those sailed by Columbus, there remains so
much uncertainty that every attempt to construct replicas, including several
now under way for quincentennial celebrations, has involved guesswork, Parrent
said.  </TEXT>

  Next year marks the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first visit to the New
World. The explorer landed in the Bahamas on Oct. 12, 1492.;   Later on that
epochal first voyage, Columbus visited what became Cuba and planted a cross
claiming the island of Hispaniola for Spain.;   Cruising eastward north of the
island, which today embraces Haiti and the Dominican Republic, Columbus set
sail from Cap-Haitien on Christmas Eve of 1492.;   About an hour after
midnight, strong tidal currents shoved the square-rigged wooden vessel onto a
barrier reef. As the tide receded, the Santa Maria's seams split. The crew was
forced to abandon ship.;   Columbus transferred to the smaller Nina and
returned to Spain, leaving most of the Santa Maria's crew ashore to build a
fortified settlement he called "Navidad" (Christmas), using timbers from the
shipwreck.;   When Columbus returned the next year, he found that Indians
resentful over their mistreatment by the Spaniards had killed all the settlers
and burned Fort Navidad to the ground.  </TEXT>

   Columbus and His Controversial Legacy
   ----

<LP>
   Toward the very end of this documentary, a beaming Edward
I. Koch appears -- one of a group of people invited to give
their views on Columbus's legacy. Always a man to get down to
the real significance of events, Mr. Koch, who was then still
mayor of New York, observes, "If Christopher Columbus had not
crossed the seas in 1492, I would never have been the mayor.
Isn't that true?"
   It is a nice moment, the mayor in his old form. Besides,
by this time in the proceedings -- the end of a grandly
conceived, extraordinarily detailed seven-part PBS series --
we are about ready for a laugh. However, neither the National
Council of Churches, nor other Columbus bashers, will find
much to be amused at or to like in "Columbus and the Age of
Discovery," whose first two episodes aired last night.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Try though the film makers did to accommodate all views,
including the current politically correct one, the Columbus
that emerges from this work is unmistakably a heroic figure,
whose achievement and historic legacy are eminently worthy of
celebration. This is not, of course, the view of the National
Council of Churches, which recently took occasion to express
its horror at the prospect of the quincentenary celebrations.
In keeping with the advanced political views for which it is
justly famed, the NCC declared that Columbus's arrival in the
New World was an occasion for "repentance" not celebration,
since Columbus's disovery had led to "genocide" as well as
"ecocide" and a host of other crimes against humanity too
numerous to mention here. The European discovery and
settlement of the New World was, in the view of the National
Council of Churches, "a historic tragedy."
   In this posture, the National Council of Churches is,
needless to say, not alone. The National Endowment for the
Humanities, the second largest financial supporter (after
Xerox) of "Columbus and the Age of Discovery," not long ago
refused to fund another film project because of its treatment
of Columbus. In the opinion of that film maker too, Columbus
was guilty of genocide -- a view, it need hardly be said, now
all the rage among the politically enlightened.
   The current PBS series doesn't neglect the ravages that
the age of discovery brought to the native peoples of the new
land. But neither, to its credit, does it neglect to note the
benefits the Europeans brought to the New World, and also
those they took from it. The most engrossing installment is
"The Columbian Exchange" (named after the 1972 book of the
same name, by Alfred W. Crosby, on which it is based). This
segment, which airs tomorrow night as part six, follows the
journey of the potato, of which Europeans were ignorant till
it was brought to their shores from the New World. The
potato, discovered in the Andes, became the subsistence crop
that fed and enlarged the population of Europe. This
impressive episode (the script was written by Graham Chedd)
also delivers a shattering history of the Irish potato
famine. It connects events and consequences, something that
this documentary does, on the whole, very well.
   The potato famine brought the migration from Ireland to
America. African slaves worked and died on the sugar
plantations of the New World. But -- as this production makes
clear -- the New World also introduced the corn and cassava
that would become the mainstays of the African food supply.
The series (produced by Zvi Dor-Ner) often feels like a
return visit -- a fascinating one to be sure -- to the
gradeschool classroom, where teachers once taught geography
and history and where -- so we are assured -- it is still
taught.
   The series is at its best in this factual mode. On the
other hand, nothing in the script equals the power of the
readings from Columbus's diary of his voyage: "Sunday,
September 16, 1492. Today there were some clouds and it was a
great delight to enjoy the morning. Nothing was lacking but
to hear the nightingales."
   At its worst, the script can get to be like a good part of
tonight's first hour, titled "The Crossing." Here we are
dragged aground, through the Spanish navy's commemoration of
the Columbus quincentenary. Captains and crews man replicas
of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria and attempt to retrace
Columbus's first voyage. If there were any justice in the
world, a special place in hell would be reserved for the
person who invented dramatic re-enactments. Granted,
television requires pictures, which this sort of re-creation
can provide, but such pictures come at a high cost to
authenticity. Parts of the re-enactment of Columbus's voyage,
in fact, seem positively unhinged. At one point, a sonorous
voice declares that "many things have changed in 500 years,
but not the pattern of life on a sailing vessel" -- a message
accompanied by footage of a sailor in yuppie athletic togs
doing his situps. Also helping to put us in the historical
mood is the pop vocal blaring from the Nina or maybe it's the
Pinta. In one corner of the deck on which Columbus's men are
supposed to be sailing, a sailor sits playing "As Time Goes
By" on his trumpet. Yes, we can feel the 15th century all
around us. At another point, we are privileged to see a power
boat draw near one of the Columbus replicas -- and to learn
that it carries one sailor's girlfriend and his parents, on
an outing.
   In short, this production has its flaws. Some are simply
annoyances, such as the repetition of cautious formulations
designed to avoid offending any political side. Columbus is
forever being described as a man who changed the course of
history "for better or for worse" or its equivalents -- of
which there are many. And -- not to be stuffy -- but is it
asking too much of a PBS film into which millions were poured
that its writers have enough of a grasp of English usage to
keep them from producing lines such as the one that informs
us that Columbus was so rushed, he had no time "to
contemplate the enormity of his journey?"
   Flaws and annoyances aside, this exploration of Columbus
and the New World is a major achievement, a fact that becomes
increasingly evident in the final three hours, which air
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. At the end, the film's effort
to maintain an even keel in all political directions finally
yields, as the narrator, with some passion, utters the last
line: "So let us commemorate -- and yes, celebrate
Christopher Columbus." If this portrait is the worst thing to
happen to Columbus and his legacy in the months to come, we
will have reason to be grateful.

SEARCH FOR THE NEW WORLD LAUNCHES MODERN TURF WAR;

<P>
PROTOCOL: THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS THE SPOILS FROM 
CELEBRATION OF 500TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' VOYAGE. 
</P>

<P>
Although the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New 
World is still two years away, the city and county are engaged in what one 
official calls a "protocol war" over control of Los Angeles' celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said it was insulting that a federal commission selected the 
County Board of Supervisors as the local coordinator for the 1992 celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the commission reconsiders, the mayor's office said, the city will drop 
out of the celebration, whose main event will be a parade of tall ships, led by 
replicas of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, which will sail into Long Beach 
Harbor and other ports around the country, but not Los Angeles Harbor, 
according to the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
City pride and tourist dollars are at stake, according to Bradley's chief of 
protocol, Beatrice Canterbury Lavery. "This is not a silly fight between the 
offices of protocol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Ed Edelman said, "Egos are involved." 
</P>
<P>
"These protocol wars should cease," Edelman added. "Every time I talk to 
diplomats here, they tell me they're always in the middle between the city and 
county." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors established their own office of protocol in 1983 after 
receiving what they considered casual treatment during a visit to Los Angeles 
by Britain's Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
While Bradley played host to the queen and repeatedly was photographed at her 
side, the supervisors had to remind city officials to include them on the 
invitation list for a small luncheon planned for her at the Music Center, a 
county-run facility. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city and county offices of protocol have clashed over such 
things as who should be first to greet visiting dignitaries and seating 
arrangements at dinners, according to officials who were present. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest dispute, Bradley said he was shocked by the selection of the 
county to coordinate Los Angeles' celebration -- especially after he traveled 
to Spain last year to discuss the city's plans for the event with King Juan 
Carlos I. 
</P>
<P>
The designation was awarded in April by the federal Christopher Columbus 
Quincentenary Jubilee Commission, based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The county's volunteer chief of protocol, Sandra J. Ausman, said: "The 
commission wanted a governmental body that had the ability to bring together 
all the cities of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This (celebration) belongs to everyone," she said. "It doesn't belong to one 
city." 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley, in a strongly worded letter to the commission, pointed out that 
the city spent three years planning for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"It was even more insulting that this decision was made without our knowledge 
or consultation," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The city should run the celebration because it was founded by the King of 
Spain, said Lavery, who is paid $56,104 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the Spanish city," she said. "The county is not a Spanish county." 
</P>
<P>
Lavery complained that the county "never informed us they were going to compete 
with us. . . . The county keeps trying to come into our territory. I don't 
interfere in their territory." 
</P>
<P>
County protocol chief Ausman said the county offered to coordinate the event 
after being approached by a commission official and a Spanish diplomat who 
complained that the city was not making enough progress. Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich added that members of Los Angeles' Italian community also complained 
to him about the city's efforts to honor the Genovese sailor Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Joustra, the commission's public relations director, said: "We felt the 
ball had been dropped by the city. I don't know what they have been doing for 
three years, but they haven't been doing it with us." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's choice of the Republican-dominated Board of Supervisors over the 
Democrat Bradley had nothing to do with politics, Joustra said. The commission, 
although appointed by Republican President Bush, is bipartisan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has established a local committee to plan events and raise private 
funds for the celebration. At least $2 million is needed to pay for the ships' 
visit, Ausman said. 
</P>
<P>
The replicas will duplicate Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic from Spain. 
They will sail into New York Harbor on July 4, 1992, then travel through the 
Panama Canal to arrive in San Francisco on Columbus Day, Oct. 12. On Sept. 27, 
1992, they will berth at Long Beach, where visitors will be allowed to board. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman said she is working on a way to include Los Angeles Harbor in the 
celebration and plans to invite city officials to serve on the organizing 
committee for the celebration. "I am hoping that all of this will be put behind 
us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lavery said the chairman of the federal commission recently suggested that "we 
might peel off one of the caravels" and let the ship visit Los Angeles Harbor. 
However, she said, city officials responded: "No way."

   Japan will build a replica of Christopher
Columbus's ship, the Santa Maria, and sail it from Spain to Japan
in 1992 to mark the 500th anniversary of the explorer's discovery
of America, an official said Thursday.
   Akihiko Osugi, an official at Kadokawa Publishing Co., said the
plan was announced Wednesday by company president Haruki Kadokawa,
who is chairman of the organizing committee.
   Osugi said that at the suggestion of Eikichi Hayashiya, a former
Japanese ambassador to Spain, Kadokawa and other businessmen,
politicians and scholars decided to fulfill Columbus' dream of
sailing from Spain to Japan.
   He said Japanese technicians will build a replica of the
three-mast Santa Maria, used by Columbus when he discovered
American in 1492. The replica, to be built in Barcelona, Spain,
will cost $9.85 million, he said.

   Actor Burt Reynolds' idea to expand
business at his ranch is causing some disagreement.
   Reynolds wants a zoning change for the B.R. Ranch, where he lives
and has a feed store, souvenir shop and petting farm.
   His plan to add a gas station and car wash, double the size of
the souvenir shop and build shops and offices was approved by a Palm
Beach County advisory panel Thursday.
   County site planner James Youngblood said the zoning change is
appropriate for the site in rural Jupiter. Earlier, a county staff
report called the planned development ``too intense'' and said it
would ``create a lone commercial pocket'' in a rural area.
   County commissioners will consider the plan at a public hearing
Oct. 2.

   ``Leaving a child in day care with strangers goes against
everything a mother is taught in Southeast Asian culture. As a
result, many of these women stay at home with their children and
turn to welfare to make ends meet, all because culturally
appropriate child care has been unavailable,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.

   About this time of year in 1490, Columbus was chewing his
fingernails in Salamanca, Spain, waiting for a royal
commission to advise Ferdinand and Isabella on whether they
should finance his proposed voyage west to reach the East.
   Half a millennium later, dozens of amateur and
professional space enthusiasts await word of who, if anyone,
will finance a voyage that seems almost as far-fetched: a
race to Mars by solar-sailing spaceships.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Early last year, these space fans' imaginations were
grabbed by a proposal from the Christopher Columbus
Quincentenary Jubilee Commission. To mark the Italian's
discovery, the U.S. group suggested, teams from around the
world would build and launch in October 1992 a fleet of three
small spaceships unlike any ever seen.
   Once in space, each of these unmanned ships would unfurl
thousands of square yards of gossamer sails that would billow
out under the almost infinitesimal pressure of sunlight.
Driven only by light bouncing off the sails' surfaces and
steered from Earth by electronic tillers and mainsheets, the
ships would tack past the moon and head for the red planet.
   The team whose sailing ship made the quickest transit from
Earth to Mars would claim the first Columbus 500 Space Sail
Cup, a trophy that would be put up for grabs every 10 years.
   At least that was the plan the Jubilee Commission put
forth in late 1988. Fascinated by the idea, space cadets of
all ages and disciplines rushed to their computers and
drawing boards. Last November, a committee of experts picked
the preliminary designs of eight teams -- three from the U.S.
and one each from Canada, England, Italy, Japan and the
Soviet Union -- that seemed to have a chance of actually
making it to Mars.
   But alas, history repeats itself. Many of the would-be
space sailors say they feel the kind of letdown Columbus must
have felt in 1486 when a rich Spaniard, the Conde de Medina
Celi, backed out on a promise to lend him some caravels.
   When the Quincentenary Commission called for design
proposals last year, "it indicated it was going to raise
funds," says Harold Fox, director of the solar sail project
for the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore. Scientists and engineers at the
laboratory rounded up government, industrial and university
space enthusiasts in Maryland and designed a $15 million
solar sail.
   But "they busted the bubble" a month ago, Mr. Fox says of
the commission's Columbus 500 Space Sail Project. Not only
did the project's director reveal that no money had been
raised, Mr. Fox says, but "the teams were encouraged to seek
funding on their own." The disappointed Johns Hopkins/APL
team is talking to some potential donors, he says. "We'll
give it a couple more months," but if funds aren't in sight
by then, the project will be shelved, he says.
   "I'm enthusiastic and I'd love to see it happen, but I'm
not into fund raising," says Andreas von Flotow, professor of
astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass. Mr. von Flotow and a graduate student will
spend the summer working on their concept of a $3 million
"heliogyro" with eight 250-foot bladelike sails. But that's
the most he can do without funding, he says.
   A Canadian team has obtained about $3 million worth of
hardware and services promised from corporations and this
month will test the waters of Canadian nationalism by
launching a public fund-raising drive. "If we can get nominal
cash donations from 100,000 individuals," then Canada can
launch its own $9.6 million (Canadian) entry in the race,
says Steve Horvath, a computer expert who heads the Canadian
Solar Sail Project organized by the Canadian Space Society.
   Fittingly, it's the Italians who seem really committed.
"We accepted with enthusiasm to do this space sailing to
Mars," says Joseph Viriglio, managing director of the space
systems group at Aeritalia, a Turin aerospace company.
Aeritalia is leading an industrial consortium to build and
launch a $20 million space sailer to be named the Capitana
Italica, the other name for the Santa Maria. "We are quite
confident of raising the money," Mr. Viriglio says.
   The man who dreamed up the race and heads the Columbus 500
Space Sail Project, Klaus P. Heiss, remains optimistic. Mr.
Heiss is a mathematical economist who has worked on the
economics of a number of space projects, including the space
shuttle. He concedes the project doesn't yet have any money,
but says "funding is being strongly pursued" and a
fund-raising consortium will be organized by early July. The
project, he says, is still planning to get three ships,
including at least one from North America, ready to launch in
October 1992. "It can be done if we have $25 million in
cash," he says.
   The idea of sailing through interplanetary space on puffs
of light is far from new, but it's never been tried.
Scientists have known since the turn of the century that when
light reflects off an object it exerts pressure on that
object. In the 1920s, the details of sun sailing in space
were worked out by two Russians, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (a
schoolteacher who earlier had devised a remarkably prescient
way to rocket men to the moon) and Fridrikh Tsander, a
mathematician.
   Enthusiasts, however, say a 1951 article in Astounding
magazine by scientist and science-fiction writer Carl A.
Wiley gave birth to present concepts of solar sails. And they
trace the idea of a race to a 1963 Arthur C. Clarke
science-fiction story about an America's Cup-type race to the
moon among seven space sailors.
   In "The Wind From the Sun," Mr. Clarke noted that the
pressure of sunlight on one's hand was about a millionth of
an ounce. With this minuscule pressure applied to two square
miles of a sail in space, the sail would move about an inch
in the first second and about 60 feet in the first minute,
Mr. Clarke calculated. In an hour it would accelerate to 80
miles per hour, and by the end of the day the ship would be
traveling 2,000 mph -- and the speed would continue to build
day after day.
   The sails could be maneuvered by changing their angle to
the sun's rays, just as a sailing ship maneuvers in the wind.
Power to change the angles of the sail, "trimming" it, as
well as power for communications, could come from
solar-electric cells. Thus, the sail could flit through space
without a drop of fuel.
   All this prompted NASA in the late 1970s to commission Jet
Propulsion Laboratories in Pasadena, Calif., to design a
solar sailship to rendezvous with Halley's Comet when it came
by in 1986. Unlike rocket-launched probes that could only fly
by, a sail ship could maneuver about the comet for several
days.
   The Halley's project foundered on a budget reef. But the
idea fascinated a group of space enthusiasts in Southern
California, who organized the World Space Foundation and
built what is still the world's only space-sail manufacturing
machine. In 1981 they actually built a 50-foot-square
prototype solar sail of aluminized Mylar plastic, which was
unfurled once, in a gymnasium.
   Designing "sunjammers," as they were dubbed in a 1964
science-fiction story by Poul Anderson, is far from simple.
To get the most sail area per pound of spacecraft weight, the
sail must be tissue-thin. Proposed sails are huge, with
diameters and diagonals three to seven times the length of
the 117-foot Santa Maria. The Canadians' hexagonal sail would
cover 12,000 square yards, while the disk-shaped one designed
by Cambridge Consultants Ltd. in England would cover 15
acres, or 11 football fields.
   Yet the sails are so light they must be unfurled at least
1,000 miles above the Earth's surface, where there's not the
slightest wisp of atmosphere to drag them down. This altitude
is beyond the reach of the space shuttle, so ships must be
launched by rocket.
   The trickiest part of the whole race is unfurling the
giant sails after they've been packed into a nose cone.
Cambridge Consultants designed its sail, dubbed the Nina,
with 36 elastic ribs wound around a central hub, with the
sail folded up between the ribs. In space the ribs would
spring out radially from the hub.
   The Johns Hopkins/APL team figures its sail will have to
spend 60 to 90 days in a steadily elongating elliptical orbit
before it has enough speed to break free of Earth's gravity.
If it breaks loose at just the right moment, it will be
grabbed by the moon's gravity and whipped out on a course to
Mars, getting there in maybe 400 to 500 days.
   If past is prologue, the would-be space sailors are in for
at least one more disappointment. The finalists are to be
picked this October, by which time Mr. Heiss's promised
consortium should know its prospects for funds. This is 500
years almost to the month from the report of the Talavera
Committee on Columbus' request. The committee told Ferdinand
and Isabella that it wasn't proper for them "to favor an
affair that rested on such weak foundations and which
appeared uncertain and impossible to any educated person,
however little learning he might have."
   And President Bush doesn't have any jewels to hock.

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (1): The fair of the
century - About 18m visitors are expected at Seville's Universal Exposition.
The fair, commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to
America, also heralds the return of Spain to Europe's mainstream after
centuries of seclusion

THE WORLD'S most sophisticated railway lines run up to it. Europe's newest
airport was built for it. Spain's best roads have just reached it. What if
no one comes to it?
Of course they will] Welcome to the 1992 Universal Exposition, or Expo '92,
in Seville, the biggest, certainly the most expensive, and easily the most
rapidly assembled celebration of any single event, probably, in human
history.
The cost? About Dollars 9bn, but who's counting? It is too easy to knock
Expo - it is a big, brash, fabulous waste of money  - and much harder to
appreciate what its success means to Spain.
This is a country gripped by one dominating and rampaging anxiety - what do
other people think of it? Hardly a week goes by in Spain without a symposium
somewhere devoted to this very serious matter. Its newspapers write articles
about what foreign newspapers write about Spain.
Now, in these few days before Expo opens and the country's 1992 celebrations
(including the Olympics in Barcelona in July) really get underway, Spain is
fluffing its skirts and patting its hair like a young lady preparing for her
first date, hoping to get a glimpse of herself in a nice big mirror before
the night is over.
Expo and the foreigners that go to it are that mirror. By Expo's success and
by the smiles on the faces of its visitors, Spain, or a large part of it,
will judge itself. Spaniards know that many northern Europeans think they
are a lazy, good for nothing and untrustworthy lot.
It is nonsense, of course, but there have been some horrible moments along
the way to Expo: when a terrible fire, caused by careless working practices,
destroyed one of the Expo's most important pavilions in February, the press
was vicious.
'Chapuza Nacional' screamed one - national cock-up  - as if to say it before
some foreigner did. Earlier a replica of the first ship to sail round the
world toppled over moments after being launched and some crew in replicas of
Columbus's three ships tried to run away when they reached the US.
About 18m people, the organisers say, will go to Seville to meander about
the town and the Expo site between its opening on April 20 and its closure
176 days later on October 12, 500 years to the day that Christopher Columbus
first set foot in the new World.
The site is Cartuja Island, once home to a monastery where Columbus often
rested after his great voyages. The 450 hectare island sits in the middle of
the Guadalquivir River that skirts Seville and up which eventually sailed
gold-laden galleons for the century or so in which Spain was able to reap
maximum benefit from the colonisation of Latin America that Columbus had
begun.
The monastery still stands, but dwarfed by the incredible Expo city that has
been built around it. It is impossible to stand in the middle of it - even
while frantic last-minute preparations continued  - and not be thrilled by
the sheer scale of what has been put down on Cartuja and the speed with
which it has been done.
Just 18 months ago Cartuja was little more than a swampy bulldozed mess. In
four days time the Expo will open its 95 pavilions, 70 bars, 150 shops,
40,000-place car park, 16 banks to the public. Somehow, the organisers have
managed to squeeze in 55,000 different pieces of entertainment at 21 stages
dotted around the site. The New York Metropolitan Opera will be coming, and
so will opera from Vienna, Dresden and Milan. Trinidad and Tobago are
sending a steel band.
The whole point is that everyone is coming and Expo '92 is probably going to
be the last truly great cultural statement of this century. It is not, or it
should not be, a trade fair. It is a celebration of knowledge and,
specifically, discovery. The country, theme and corporate pavilions may not
push the barriers of architectural knowledge beyond what we already know,
but nowhere on earth are the eccentric and conventional forms and structures
of the late 20th century so brilliantly scrambled together. At the risk of
sounding like a publicist, Expo promises to be terrific fun.
This is, after all, Andalucia. The incredible noise on the streets and in
the bars of Seville could just as easily be the sound of Spain's beating
heart. These people taught the rest of Spain the meaning of fiesta.
Visitors might find Seville a little cramped - not any more so than during
its Easter fiesta - but it is the smallest city ever to host a Universal
Exposition and it has managed to attract the greatest number of countries to
take part. One result will be a great shortage of accommodation and what is
available will be very expensive.
For most of the time the fair is opened, it will also be unspeakably hot.
That partly explains why the Expo site will be open until four in the
morning every day and also why the organisers felt it necessary to plant
350,000 trees and shrubs around the site. Shade will be Expo's most valuable
commodity.
Just how valuable the Expo is to Seville is already easy to measure. It was
King Juan Carlos who first suggested (naturally, when one is the King, one's
ideas are always one's very own ideas) holding an Expo at Seville in 1992.
That was in the late 1970s. But it was the election of the socialist
government, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in 1982 that really set
things moving.
Mr Gonzalez and his most senior advisers were all Andalucians in the early
years and they have bent over backwards to make sure that, along with the
Expo, Andalucia in 1992 would be used to mark the return of Spain to
prominence as a major economic and democratic power. Their Andalucia was
(and still is) a largely poor, dry and illiterate place. It has bred some
wonderful people but given them precious little to live off.
So Andalucia has been showered with gifts for this year. Easily the most
exotic is the world's newest high-speed train line, between Madrid and
Seville, with a branch to the Expo entrance.
Just outside Seville, where the airport was once little more than a
blockhouse, stands a spanking new terminal capable of taking 8m passengers a
year.
After the Expo, it could take Seville 20 years to use that airport to
capacity. Around the city are nearly 70km of new roads and eight new bridges
cross the Guadalquivir, while five new highways connect Seville with
Andalucia's other great centres and with Madrid.
This is Andalucia's big chance. It has become fashionable to speak of
Andalucia as Europe's next, or first, Silicon Valley. But it may just find
the imagination needed to turn the infrastructure it has been showered with
in the past few years to its advantage once all the visitors have gone.
The Expo organisers have already established a project - Cartuja 93  - which
is designed to preserve the Expo site more or less intact for use as a base
for research and study. Andalucia has never shown much interest in the
future, but Cartuja may change that.
Just as it may change the way Spaniards think about their past. What is
being celebrated here is Columbus's discovery of America, or what he thought
was the East, and the firm establishment, for arguably the first time, of
true democracy in Spain. Both are important, for the Expo has neatly
coincided with an intense effort by Spain to reconnect itself with its
former colonies in Latin America, which now account for just 3 per cent of
Spain's trade.
Latin America holds up a rather different mirror to Spain than do its
admiring European partners. It is an older mirror, perhaps darker too. The
devastation wrought by the Conquistadores on the native populations of the
countries they invaded still provokes quick and fiery argument in Spain.
Should Spain feel shame at that memory? Surely not now, just as it has been
able to welcome back and legalise the Jews 500 years after their expulsion
by Ferdinand and Isabella.
This is not a very contemplative society, but Spaniards who think about
themselves might want to extract as much as they can from the Latin
Americans who come to Seville. That continent's chaos, its struggle for
democracy, has a frighteningly clear reflection in Spain as well. Some
people think they know why - that by the time the Conquistadores sallied
forth democracy in Spain had already been lost as a trade off for land and
title.
That notion is suspect simply for being so neat and tidy and the lessons to
be drawn from what Columbus began 500 years ago in Latin America are not
easily defined. The Spanish started planning for 1992 calling it the year of
Discovery until South Americans reminded Spaniards that people were living
in the new world long before 1492. Spain changed the theme of 1992, then, to
the Re-encounter. That seems more apt and, even if it says nothing much, it
is at least a mark of a new humility.

   Spain's plans to stage a
headline-grabbing 500th birthday party for America in 1992 have
stirred up a storm of controversy over how Portugal is celebrating
its own discoverers, who were charting the Atlantic before
Christopher Columbus was born.
   Spain and Portugal were archrivals in the push in the 15th and
16th centuries to sail off the end of known maps and find new
worlds. Both succeeded.
   But now, many Portuguese fear their neighbors are stealing the
limelight for the 1992 fiesta.
   At the center of Spain's celebrations is Seville's Expo '92, a
530-acre international fair that is set to end a six-month run Oct.
12, 1992, 500 years to the day after Columbus reached the Caribbean
island of San Salvador.
   Also making Spain hot property in 1992 will be the excitement of
the Summer Olympic games in Barcelona. And the European Economic
Community has chosen Madrid as its cultural capital on the eve of
the trading bloc's deadline to create a single European market.
   Compared with all that, Portugal's 1992 celebrations seem
lackluster.
   Lisbon's government-appointed National Discoveries Commission is
promoting research, exhibitions and the publishing of more history
books about the era.
   It has commissioned American composer Philip Glass to write an
opera for 1992 release, based probably on the Lusiads _ an epic
poem about Vasco da Gama's voyages that was written by Portugal's
16th century roving bard, Luis de Camoes.
   But the Spaniards got there first by casting Catalan soprano
Montserrat Caballe and tenor Jose Carreras in Cristobal Colon, an
opera based on trials and tribulations of the Genoese captain. It
sold out when it premiered in Barcelona in September.
   News media, executives and even historians here have called for
more glamour to promote Portugal's past glories and to show that it
is a rapidly modernizing European country.
   ``I'm ashamed at how my country is celebrating the
discoveries,'' said Waldemar de Abreu, a Lisbon publisher and
editor of ``The Portuguese Christopher Columbus _ Secret Agent of
King Dom Joao II,'' a 600-page book that claims proof the explorer
was Portuguese.
   ``Portugal could easily have pooled resources with Spain and
staged an Iberian discoveries exhibition in 1992,'' de Abreu said.
   While admitting Spain ``is pegging all the force of its
modernization on 1992,'' Vasco Graca Moura, head of the
Commission's executive board, makes no apologies for not going
overboard in that year.
   ``The main difference is that Spain is only commemorating one
date and a short journey _ Columbus' voyage in 1492 to the West
Indies,'' he said.
   ``Our celebrations began last year with Bartolomeu Dias and will
only end in 2000, with Pedro Alvares Cabral.''
   Spurred by their pioneering Prince Henry the Navigator's studies
of astronomy and cartography, Portuguese seafarers had claimed the
island of Madeira and the mid-Atlantic Azores archipelago by 1430.
   Dias took his ship around the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, leaving
da Gama to open up the sea route to India 10 years later.
   Cabral discovered Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese went east of
India to Japan, and Fernao de Magalhaes _ better known as Magellan
_ closed the Discoveries circle in 1520 by commanding the first
expedition to sail around the world.
   ``Our commemorations match our dimension _ we're smaller than
Spain, so honestly we can't be as elaborate,'' said the
commission's Antonio Mega Ferreira, though adding Portugal still
has a few tricks up its sleeve.
   Lisbon last week submitted its candidacy to the Paris-based
International Exhibitions Bureau, to hold Expo '98 _ a three-month,
international fair, only about a tenth the size of Seville.
   Instead of trying for the Olympics, Portugal is expected to bid
in January to hold soccer's World Cup in 1998.
   Expo '98's theme will be East meets West, its hero _ Vasco da
Gama. Graca Moura argues da Gama's trips to the Orient were as
important as Columbus' discovery in the West.
   Mega Ferreira's plans for Expo '98 include a subway train
connecting the undeveloped left bank of the Tagus estuary with
Lisbon's historic Belem district.
   Belem is already the site of three ornate monuments to the
discoveries _ Belem tower and Jeronimos monastery, and former
dictator Antonio Oliveira Salazar's colossal, caravel-shaped
``Padrao'' _ a pillar that navigators used to leave behind them on
land to mark the spread of the Portuguese empire.
   Salazar in 1940 organized an exhibition called ``O Mundo
Portugues'' _ the Portuguese world, that glorified the country's
discoveries and African empire to distract attention from its
isolation in Europe and World War II that was going on around it.
   ``The (center-right) government has a complex of being linked to
Salazar. They're frightened they'd be accused of nationalism, if
they did more to glorify our history,'' de Abreu said. ``But
nobody's accusing Spain's socialist government of anything, and
what is Seville if not a glorification of Spain's colonial past?''

<TEXT>     But now, in what many see as a classic morality tale of greed and
overreaching ambition, the presidential commission in charge of the
celebration is in shambles, its only big sponsor is refusing to shell out any
more money and its former chairman, John Goudie, is under federal
investigation for alleged financial improprieties.;    San Francisco officials
have  been left scrambling to save their mega-buck event, even as they try to
distance themselves from the scandal surrounding deals made under Goudie. They
must, by their own estimate, raise $15 million for the local celebration,
which few people have even heard of.;    "We aren't tainted by them," said
Michael Housh, an assistant to Mayor Art Agnos who handled San Francisco's
1988 bid to the national commission.;    But at the same time individuals and
groups around the country were refusing to do business with Goudie because of
what they allege were unethical requests from him, San Francisco alone among
the cities vying for Columbus Day was willing -- even eager -- to entertain
unusual demands by the chairman to pay the commission cash up front.;    The
world's most; dazzling event ever;    The quincentenary celebration of
Columbus' voyage to America had been promoted -- initially by Spain, later by
other countries including the United States -- as the most dazzling event of
its kind the world had ever seen. Bigger than the Bicentennial. Bigger than
the Statue of Liberty party.;    By one account, Columbus commissions had been
organized in 30 countries, 39 states and 100 cities. Exhibits, movies, tours,
medallions, mugs, T-shirts, sporting events, operas, conferences, books,
scholarships, contests, parties -- the multibillion-dollar Columbus
celebration would have it all.;    And everyone wanted a piece of it.;    The
centerpiece of the pageant was to be the re-creation of the historical voyage
itself: Replicas of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria would sail from
Spain, host of the 1992 World's Fair and Summer Olympics, and make their way
to the Western Hemisphere, visiting 50 U.S. port cities on an extended tour.; 
  But the prize, which San Francisco won, was who got the show on Columbus Day
1992, the anniversary of the day Columbus landed on an island in the Bahamas
that he named San Salvador.;    City officials, mesmerized by their vision of
hosting the event, have not let a few inconvenient historical facts get in the
way of a lucrative commercial opportunity.;    Columbus never landed anywhere
near San Francisco. The telegenic caravels, supposedly a symbol of 16th
century discovery, will be flying Texaco Inc. flags, and their crew members
will be sporting Texaco emblems. And the ships won't really sail in from
anywhere; they will be carted overland from the East Coast by a subsidiary of
the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.;    Commission head;
resigned suddenly;    The person heading this massive jubilee in the United
States was a Republican fund-raiser and Miami-based Cuban-American businessman
who describes himself as a longtime acquaintance of President Bush's son, Jeb,
a Miami developer.;    Goudie, who by all accounts ran the commission like a
private empire, resigned suddenly in December 1990. A spate of news stories
had detailed his personal financial problems, including failing to file
federal tax returns in 1986 and 1987, and allegations of financial
improprieties in the commission's dealings.;    A recent audit by the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, found no
commission money unaccounted for, but a separate criminal investigation of
Goudie's activities continues. Goudie denied any wrongdoing in a recent
telephone interview but declined to discuss allegations in detail.;    Several
businessmen and groups say he made demands they considered unethical.;    Bill
Rolen, a Tennessee businessman, wanted to establish a quincentenary center at
the former world's fair site in Knoxville. But Goudie repeatedly made
extraordinary demands, Rolen said, telling the Knoxville group to pay one of
Goudie's friends tens of thousands of dollars for radio advertising in
Venezuela, ordering that a 60-foot yacht on loan to the project be tied up
behind his Coral Gables, Fla., home and finally demanding that two of his
friends be given control of the project.;    "We saw a red flag," said Rolen,
who has worked with world's fair projects extensively. "We were smart enough
not to get involved with him. It was just unethical to do what he was
proposing to do with us. There were too many things that were not proper.";   
Others have similar stories.;    Tony Baltes, a Toledo, Ohio, businessman, and
his partners got cut out of the official quincentenary licensing group, in
which they had invested $500,000, after they started asking about thousands of
dollars in company money that went to a friend of Goudie's.;    Peter Dunev, a
Miami businessman, lost $50,000 in a quincentenary T-shirt project when he,
too, became suspicious about why his checks were being picked up by a close
friend of Goudie's. When Dunev stopped further payments, his contract with the
commission was suspended.;    In each case, these businessmen said, Goudie
ended up screaming abuses over the phone and, in two cases, threatening them
not to make complaints.;    The one big deal Goudie did line up was an
exclusive $5 million contract with Texaco that allowed the oil giant to fly
its logo over the caravels.;    After paying out $1.5 million, Texaco got into
a contract dispute with the commission and has since suspended its donations.;
   San Francisco bid; based on beauty;    Throughout this same period, San
Francisco was eagerly signing up to host the commission's Columbus Day
regatta.;    City officials say San Francisco was selected as the host city
because Mayor Agnos' office put together a bid proposal that highlighted the
city's beauties.;    "We committed to not one cent of funding," said Housh,
Agnos' aide. "We were very smart about that.";    Or maybe San Francisco just
promised more than it had time to deliver.;    Housh made contradictory
statements repeatedly over the past two weeks about the city's negotiations
with Goudie and the commission, and refused to provide documents or provided
only partial documents about the quincentenary.;    But documents obtained
from the commission and interviews with Goudie, commission members, civic
leaders and officials of other cities show that a key reason for San
Francisco's selection was its willingness to pay the commission up front for
the honor.;    The commission set the stage by declaring that it was receiving
only $220,000 annually from Congress and was in desperate need of money. Each
city was asked how it proposed to help.;    San Francisco, in its April 1988
proposal, stated its willingness to reimburse the commission "in very
substantial measure" and said the city "could well make contributions to the
commission's activities beyond reimbursement.";    Goudie, in a telephone
interview from his Coral Gables home, said San Francisco's offer to pay was
"definitely" a factor in its selection. "Plus it's a gorgeous city," Goudie
said, laughing.;    No other city made such a generous, open-ended offer.;   
San Diego ignored that part of the questionnaire. Los Angeles drafted a
carefully worded reply saying it would share any proceeds remaining after all
expenses had been paid and providing that the funds went to "non-revenue
generating activities" mandated by Congress. (San Diego and Los Angeles were
the only two other contenders for the Columbus Day regatta, which was to be
held on the West Coast because of weather restrictions.);    Not long after
San Francisco was chosen in August 1988 as the host site, the city was told to
pay the commission $800,000 before 1992 as part of regatta expenses.;    Still
later, the city was told it would be assessed an additional $2 million in cash
up front, a figure that Goudie had determined, according to commission
members.;    'We would have laughed at them';    Goudie defended his requests
for money, saying the commission was badly under-funded.;    But other groups
and city officials who worked with the national commission said his demands
for cash up front were "outrageous" and "inappropriate.";    "The commission
never asked us for a dime because they knew they'd never get it from us," said
Howard Slotnick, director of Operation Sail in New York, which has handled
numerous regattas and is also in charge of the caravel and tall ship parade
planned there for July 4, 1992. "We would have laughed at them.";    Slotnick
said he advised San Francisco city officials "not to pay any of it" when they
asked for his advice early on in negotiations.;    Cities typically provide
in-kind services -- police and fire services, housing for crews, port
services, accommodations for dignitaries -- but any request for cash up front
is highly unusual, say those who have handled such events.;    Spanish
officials, who have discarded their contract with the presidential commission
and are now organizing the caravel tour themselves, say they believe the money
Goudie asked for had nothing to do with the ships' tour.;    They are not
asking any cities for tour fees, said Miguel Ferrer, director of projects for
the Spain '92 Foundation, a non-profit group operating on behalf of Spain.;   
Both city officials and Goudie say no money ever went from San Francisco to
the commission. The executive director of the commission, however, declined to
make public a list of donations.;    Dispute continues; as time runs out;   
With Columbus Day 1992 only 17 months away, the national commission and Texaco
and Spain remain mired in dispute. The criminal investigation of Goudie's
activities continues. And Spain '92 officials say tour plans are still
tentative, but they intend to honor the designation of San Francisco as host
city for the Columbus Day event.;    Many of those involved in quincentennial
events locally and around the nation say they fear that the Goudie
controversy, coming on top of challenges raised by Indian groups, will keep
big corporate sponsors away.;    California's joint legislative committee on
the quincentennial and its non-profit fund-raising arm have provided five
taxpayer-paid trips to Spain for a few lucky legislators. But the state, which
by April had not raised a cent from corporate sponsors during the committee's
three years of work, will not be much help to San Francisco.;    "The task
ahead will not be easy," said Rep. Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, in prepared remarks
at a House subcommittee hearing on the presidential commission late last
month. "The commission's financial position is precarious, its image is
tarnished, and time is running out."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  I FIRST read Samuel Eliot Morison's; biography of Christopher Columbus when I

right up there with "The Odyssey" and Conrad's novels of the sea.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Columbus is a troubling figure. Clearly heroic, he accomplished a great
deed in the face of difficulty, and his achievement changed the world. But
though he surely did what he did, he didn't know he was doing it, and that
somewhat darkens the image. And while he did change the world, the question --
still a hot topic of debate after 500 years is whether he changed it for the
better.;   Here in the United States, we sometimes act as if Columbus had been
Citizen No. 1. But in Latin America, nearly two dozen former Spanish colonies
still struggle to get over the influence of a nation that acted more like a
wicked stepmother than a mother country. Columbus is no hero there.;  
Certainly one accepted truth needs debunking. Columbus "discovered" nothing,
and to say otherwise dismisses the accomplishments, the dignity, even the
humanity of the millions of people who lived in the Americas long before
Columbus stepped ashore, most of whom were doomed to death within a
generation. Columbus, it's worth remembering, saw American blood within hours
of landing.;   The 1992 quincentenary of Columbus's arrival gives us an
opportunity to re-evaluate both past and present and to look closely at the
Old World, the other Old World of the Americas, and at the consequences of
that momentous encounter.;   Publishers, naturally, are offering enough new
books on the subject to sink the Santa Maria. The best of them are highlighted
first, followed by a wide range of others.;   Worthy of presentation to
Isabella herself; Samuel Eliot Morison's "Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of
Christopher Columbus" (Little, Brown, $24.95 paperback) won a Pulitzer Prize
when it was first published in 1941. It shaped our image and understanding of
Columbus for decades after, and it still reads like a thriller. Every writer
on Columbus in the last half-century has begun with Morison, and so should
every reader.;   For those of us who believe that art and ideas tell the real
truth of history, nothing matches "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration"
(Yale, $59.95), edited by Jay A. Levenson. This is the catalog of a National
Gallery of Art exhibition that opens Oct. 12. The book, with more than 500
color illustrations, presents art from around the world in that watershed
year. China, India, Africa, the Americas and Europe are represented, with
authoritative commentary by a phalanx of scholars. If we were in the habit of
giving Columbus Day gifts, this is what I'd want.;   Kenneth Nebenzahl's
"Atlas of Columbus and The Great Discoveries" (Rand McNally, $75) is a
cartophile's dream come true. Beginning with the world as it was known in
Columbus's time, the author presents rare maps, many in color, that document
Europe's new understanding of the world. The maps themselves are beautiful and
fascinating and the text clarifies even the most obscure of them.;   "Columbus
and the Age of Discovery" (Morrow, $40) by Zvi Dor-Ner with William Scheller
is the companion volume to the seven-part PBS series. The authors sailed
Columbus's route in replicas of his ships built by the Spanish Navy, but the
book covers more than just the adventure. In text and 300 illustrations, it
surveys all the varied aspects of the enterprise.;   "Seeds of Change"
(Smithsonian, $39.95, $24.95 paperback) by Herman J. Viola and Carolyn
Margolis accompanies an exhibition opening Oct. 26 at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of Natural History. It documents in text and well-chosen
pictures the exchange of food, tools, diseases and everything else between
Europe and the Americas. The transfers included corn, potatoes, tomatoes and
syphilis to Europe; horses, cattle, sugar cane and smallpox to America.;  
"Conquest of Eden 1493-1515" (Academy Chicago, $34.95) by Michael Paiewonsky
uses eyewitness accounts and rare illustrations from a private collection to
examine Columbus's later voyages in the Caribbean. Published in the Virgin
Islands and printed in Italy (in an edition of only 3,000 copies), this is a
beautifully designed and produced book. Collectors will want it for the craft
alone, and readers will like it, too.;   So many biographers, so little time; 
 The great modern biographer of Columbus is Italian scholar Paolo Emilio
Taviani whose original four-volume study has been shortened and translated as
"Columbus: The Great Adventure" (Orion Books, $20). When the first half was
published in 1974, Adm. Morison himself called it "the best and most scholarly
book I have read on Columbus's life." Taviani paints Columbus in a broad
context, seeing his life as yet another expression of the Italian
Renaissance.;   "Christopher Columbus: The Voyage of Discovery 1492" (Dorset
Press, $12.95) combines, at a bargain price, excerpts from Morison's 1974 "The
European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492-1616" with
contemporary portraits, maps, drawings and modern photos that bring the
subject to vivid life. "The Voyages of Columbus 1492-1504" (Dorset Press,
$7.95) by Lorenzo Camusso provides a straightforward life, generously
illustrated.;   "Columbus: For Gold, God and Glory" (Simon &amp; Schuster, $35)
has text by nautical writer John Dyson and photos by Peter Christopher. They
too sailed Columbus's route in a replica of the Nina, and Dyson offers a new
theory about that route, even suggesting that Columbus had a secret map.;  
"Columbus" (Oxford, $22.95) by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto focuses on the
explorer's character and intellectual world but the arch tone will, depending
on the reader's patience, either annoy or amuse.;   What becomes a legend;
most? Revisionists;   Kirkpatrick Sale's "The Conquest of Paradise:
Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy" (Plume, $12.95 paperback) is a
debunking biography. Much of it is superficial, but Sale does have some
interesting thoughts on the exchange of cultures.;   Better is "The Mysterious
History of Columbus: An Exploration of the Man, the Myth, the Legacy" (Knopf,
$24) by John Noble Wilford. A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Wilford
examines all the troublesome debates in a level-headed but lively manner.;  
Hans Koning "Columbus: His Enterprise" (Monthly Review Press, $8.95 paperback)
is fiercely revisionist, laying stress on the "era of genocide, cruelty and
slavery' introduced by Columbus. Koning's message is unpleasant. And hard to
deny.;   In his own words;   Readers tired of other people's versions of the
truth can, of course, go right back to Columbus's own reports. A new
translation of "The Log of Christopher Columbus" by Robert H. Fuson (Tab
Books, $14.92 paperback) is the one to get. It offers a fine translation, a
useful introduction, an innovative design and an historic price.;   Coming in
December is "The Columbus Papers: The Barcelona Letter of 1493" (Macmillan,
$100), a bargain compared to the $3,000 bibliophile edition published by the
New York Public Library, which owns the Barcelona Letter and the rare maps and
documents handsomely reproduced and translated in the book.;   The Old World; 
 Three new books attempt to open up for us the European world that produced
Columbus and that was about to be changed so dramatically. Cultural historian
Stephen Greenblatt, in "Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World"
(University of Chicago, $24.95), examines how a highly developed sense of the
marvelous -- Europe was astonished by Columbus's news -- can lead to
understanding as well as to exploitation.;   "Fourteen Ninety Two: The Decline
of medievalism and the Rise of the Modern Age" (Scribner, 24.95) by Barnet
Litvinoff is a lively intellectual history of a world in transition. And in
"Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians" (Praeger, $12.95),
Jeffrey Burton Russell explains what Columbus knew and then traces the
erroneous belief that he thought the earth was flat.;   The other Old World;  
Anyone who has studied the Pre-Columbian civilizations of America can only
lament the wholesale destruction of that world by the conquerors who followed
Columbus. "Kingdoms of Gold, Kingdoms of Jade: The Americas Before Columbus"
(Thames and Hudson, $24) by Brian M. Fagan offers the latest discoveries in an
illustrated, exciting and authoritative introduction to the world of the Inca,
Aztec, Maya and North American peoples.;   Food critic Raymond Sokolov, in his
wonderful book, "Why We Eat What We Eat" (Summit, $22), traces the effects of
food exchanges on the modern world. It even has some recipes.;   The October
1991 National Geographic focuses on "1491: America Before Columbus," and
portrays the Native American heritage of the United States on the eve of
change.; "Memory and Modernity: Popular Culture in Latin America" (Verso,
$59.95, $17.95 paperback) by William Rowe and Vivian Schelling surveys the
roots of modern artistic expression in the regions most directly affected by
Spanish influence.;   The fiction of discovery; Most of the fiction inspired
-- if that's the word -- by Columbus has come from Native American and Latin
American writers whose heritage keeps them ever mindful of his long-lasting
influence.;   Among the former, Gerald Vizenor is a Chippewa writer whose
latest novel, "The Heirs of Columbus" (Wesleyan University Press, $18.95),
mixes fact and fiction in a tale of the explorer's mixed-blood descendants.
Louise Erdrich (also Chippewa) and Michael Dorris (of the Modoc tribe) have
collaborated on "The Crown of Columbus" (HarperCollins, $21.95), a novel about
both self-discovery and the discovery of some lost Columbus treasures in the
Bahamas.;   Three Latin American novels are especially worthy of note. The
great Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier dramatizes the debate about Columbus's
reputation in "The Harp and the Shadow" (Mercury House, $16.95). Mexican
novelist Carlos Fuentes offers a disturbing projection of the future in
"Christopher Unborn" (Penguin, $12.95 paperback). And Homero Aridjis, also of
Mexico, vividly recreates 15th-century Spain in "1492: The Life and Times of
Juan Cabezon of Castile" (Summit, $21.95).;   Books for children; Publishers
haven't neglected young readers either.;   The most beautiful new children's
book on the subject is "Follow the Dream" (Knopf, $15) by artist Peter Sis,
but while the paintings are gorgeous, the minimal text preserves traditional
errors.;   "All Pigs on Deck" (Delacorte, $15) should amuse readers, 5 to 8.
For readers 8 to 12, "If You Were There in 1492" (Bradbury Press, $13.95) by
Barbara Brenner provides the facts, while "I Sailed with Columbus"
(HarperCollins, $13.95) by Miriam Schlein is a rousing novel of adventure.;  
Slightly older readers will like "The High Voyage" (Delacorte, $14.95) by Olga
Litowinsky, a narrative of Columbus's fourth voyage by his son, Fernando. (box)  </TEXT>

About 80 civic and community leaders gathered at the Harbor Club on Wednesday 
to begin planning for the 500th anniversary celebration of Christopher 
Columbus' discovery of America. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized and hosted by the Orange County Christopher Columbus 
Quincentenary Commission, focused on recruiting businesses to participate in 
the events planned for Orange County during the yearlong commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed celebrations are a boat parade in Newport Harbor, a special 
opera night presenting at least one of the operas written about Columbus' 
voyage, and a Mexican rodeo featuring trick riders from all over Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Collins, a member of the U.S. Quincentenary Commission, noted that 
California has been especially enthusiastic about organizing for the upcoming 
celebration. So far, he said, commissions have been established in San 
Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, and, tentatively, in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County commission was formed about a year ago to help organize 
events for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
One goal, according to commission co-chairman Frank De Santis, is that Newport 
Beach be chosen as one of the ports visited by replicas of the Nina, the Pinta 
and the Santa Maria, which will be duplicating Columbus' voyage across the 
Atlantic.LAURA MICHAELIS

<TEXT>     But even those who would rewrite history can't change it, and it was
Columbus who came west instead of the Indians going east. And that voyage did
set off a chain-reaction of epic events, both good and evil, which affect the
entire globe to this day.;   With the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first
voyage just a year away, the debate over its meaning is about to become a
cottage industry.;   And no cottage industry is complete without a TV show: in
this case PBS's seven-hour "Columbus and the Age of Discovery," public TV's
attempt to do for the discovery of America what it did last year for the Civil
War.;   But alas, Zvi Dor-Ner, the film maker who spent 10 years putting
"Columbus" together, is no Ken Burns, the man behind the magnificent "Civil
War." In Burns' hands these seven hours wouldn't seem so much like 12 or 14.; 
 What "Columbus" offers are two or three interesting hours about "history's
most stunning accident" -- stretched to seven mostly dull ones. Beautiful, but
dull.;   By the time the series really hits its stride in hour six, I'm afraid
no one will be watching.;   Most people will have a hard time staying with
Sunday's opening two hours, which meander around the globe, setting up
Columbus' times, his motivation and his struggle to get someone to finance his
dream of sailing west to reach the East. Surely this could have been done in
one hour instead of two.;   Even the prologue is prolonged, as narrator Will
Lyman ("Vietnam: A Television History") asks, "Should we celebrate Columbus'
great achievement, or should we mourn a world forever lost?";   The answer, of
course, is both. No matter what horrors followed -- and the decimation of the
native population of Hispaniola from half a million to 500 in little more than
25 years, six of them while Columbus himself was governor, certainly is a
horror -- the voyage itself was an astounding achievement of navigation and
courage. We see that chronicled in Part 3, "The Crossing.";   It's what
Columbus and others did after they landed that's so debatable, substituting
one culture for another and rarely gently.;   The debate is dealt with in
"Columbus" -- and not just by experts but by real people in the lands
affected. Like everything else here, though, the show takes a long time to get
there.;   If you hang in, however, you will learn something: that Martin
Pinzon is seen as the real hero of the first voyage by many Spaniards; or how
the exchange of crops and animals between the New and Old Worlds put horses on
the American plains, brought potatoes to Ireland, corn to Europe and sugar
cane to the Caribbean, for example.;   With cane, sadly, came slaves, a far
less noble part of the trade, explored in the series' most successful hour,
the sixth one, called "The Columbian Exchange.";   The conclusion, "In Search
of Columbus," lays out the astounding paradox of the man: "Christopher
Columbus, an Italian seaman sailing for the Catholic monarchies of Spain, has
been embraced as a national hero by the mainly English-speaking, Protestant
United States of America in a land he never set foot in, that he refused to
believe existed and that was named for someone else.";   Had the rest of this
series been as succinct, it would have been a glorious triumph instead of such
a tedious trip.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  GOODBYE, COLUMBUS
EVEN HIS BURIAL SPOT IS A SUBJECT OF MUCH
DISPUTE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story
The Great Columbus Chase
Last in a four-part series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The Cafe El Norte, facing the Plaza Mayor in the heart of this fairly plain
city on the plains of northern Andalusia. The Cafe El Norte, busy bar and
social center. The Cafe El Norte, last resting place for the Admiral of the
Open Ocean, Don Cristobal Colon, the dude who discovered America.;    Or is
it?;    Historians are in general agreement about the final fate of
Christopher Columbus. He made four voyages to the New World, starting in 1492
-- voyages that eventually destroyed his health and soured his soul. His last
years were spent haggling with the king of Spain about the profits he had
coming from the discovery of the Western Hemisphere.;    When he was given
backing by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, he extracted an agreement that
included some major concessions by the crown, including a 10 percent share of
all profits from the new lands, as well as honorary titles.;    The crown
chose to redefine the agreement toward the end of Columbus' life, taking away
most of his claims. (Despite this, he was quite rich.) He was allowed to keep
his titles -- as were his heirs. Today, there is a Cristobal Colon in Spain, a
young man who still has the right to be called the Admiral of the Open Sea,
the title  Columbus insisted he be given before he took off for the edge of
the world.;    Columbus moved to Valladolid in 1506 and died there May 20.
That much is sure. What happened after that is the subject of some debate
among scholars.;    One version has him being buried in Valladolid, then being
moved to a monastery in Seville sometime between 1509 and 1514. In 1537, he
was moved to Santo Domingo (the Bahamian island where he supposedly landed in
1492). In 1795, his remains were moved to Havana, where they stayed until the
end of the Spanish-American War. They were then sent back to Seville and
buried in the great cathedral there.;     Italian biographer Gianni Granzotto
has the most intriguing the story -- and this is where the Cafe El Norte comes
on the scene.;    Granzotto says that on the Plaza Mayor -- right where the
Cafe El Norte sits today -- there was a Franciscan monastery at the time of
Columbus' death. The monastery, St. Francis, contained a burial crypt.;    The
crypt now lies beneath the floor of the Cafe El Norte and Granzotto says it
contains the bones of Christopher Columbus, devout Franciscan.;    So it was
no surprise that after the usual tourist inquiry was made -- i.e., where's the
body? -- the owner of the Cafe El Norte himself arrived at the table and
allowed there was a chance Don Cristobal Colon was moldering beneath his
feet.;    "Many Americans, many English, they come in here and ask to see his
grave. We do not know that it really is there because that was long ago. But
perhaps, why not? It is an interesting little story, is it not?";    And so
you won't be totally disappointed that no tours of the Columbus bones are
available (or at least offered), he hands out free Cafe El Norte calendars as
souvenirs and walks away to discuss the bullfight.;    So, who cares?; 
Goodbye, Columbus, write if you find work -- or the New World, whatever -- and
don't call us, we'll call you. Valladolid, unlike most of the other European
haunts of the great explorer, seems mostly indifferent to its connection with
Spanish history.;    Yeah, there's a statue of Columbus, but this is no big
deal -- in Andalusia and most other parts of Spain, any town with more than 10
people is likely to have at least one bronze rendering of our Italian hero.;  
 The house in Valladolid where he died apparently is gone, but there is a
small museum nearby that once was owned by the Columbus family and serves as a
symbolic tie to the past. (In some tourism literature, the museum is, in fact,
described as the house where he died.);    But nowhere in the city are there
signs directing the curious to the museum, and it's clear from the patrons of
the Cafe El Norte that the exact spot where the Great Explorer dropped his
last anchor is of little importance -- especially on the afternoon of the
Madrid bullfights.;    The museum is closed this year in anticipation of the
500th anniversary of his first voyage next year, and there are some historical
displays going up around the Plaza Mayor.;    In official city maps, which
have illustrated notes about many historical buildings around the city, there
is some mention of the statue honoring "the illustrious Almirante del Mar
Oceano -- Admiral of the Open Ocean," but the location of the museum and house
are given only a single line -- and many locals, when asked, seem not to know
where the house is.;    Seville's claim;  Most of the Columbus madness around
the vast province of Andalusia is centered in Seville, site of the 1992
world's fair. The folks in Seville have no doubt about the bones -- they are
now, always have been, always will be stashed in the cathedral of Seville.
Valladolid? The Cafe El Norte? Nothing but the ramblings of an uninformed
historian -- an Italian one at that.;    Columbus used Seville as a base for
several of his later trips to the New World, and it also was from here that
the other Italian explorer -- Amerigo Vespucci, the one with the good press
agent -- sailed. (Two continents were named after Vespucci; Columbus got one
American country, one Canadian province and a nice town in Ohio.);    The 1992
Seville Expo is one of two big deals going on in Spain next year, the other
being the summer Olympic Games in Barcelona. And, like Barcelona, big chunks
of Seville are torn up in preparation.;    The Expo, like the Olympics, is
tied into the 500th anniversary of the first Columbus voyage in 1492. The Expo
theme is "The Age of Discovery," and the Columbus-Seville connection is being
pushed hard.;    Dem bones, dem bones;  Millions of people are expected to
wander through Seville next summer to check out the fair and soak up some
Columbiana. But the guest of honor won't be around. Seville can make all the
rash claims it wants, and hold all the parties it can, and hire herds of
public relations types to hype the 500th anniversary of the great admiral's
exploits. But everyone knows old Chris is stuck in Valladolid, under the floor
of the Cafe El Norte.;    We'll leave him there, 500 years and half a
continent away from where he started back in Genoa. One thing about Columbus
-- you might not admire him much, but you have to admit he got around. And
following in his footsteps around Europe won't make you any better historian,
but it surely will lead you to some great food, nice folks and pretty
scenery.;    It almost makes you want to hop on a leaky old boat and sail off
to the edge of the world.;    Almost.  </TEXT>

   Joseph Laufer Is
   Ready to Observe
   Columbus's Feat

   But the Official Fete Has Run

   As he stands before groups of schoolchildren in his
tights, doublet and cape, Joseph Laufer may not be the
spitting image of Christopher Columbus. But he has the look.
The 56-year-old amateur historian and "events person" also
has some of the explorer's pluck. He certainly has thrown
himself into commemorating whatever it was that Columbus, an
Italian, did for Spain in 1492. It has become one of the
touchiest events in American history.
   Some of the splashier official celebrations planned for
next year's 500th anniversary of Columbus's epic voyage have
run aground. The Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee
Commission, created by Congress in 1984 to coordinate events
large and small, is broke. Its chairman, John Goudie,
resigned recently amid charges of mismanagement that are
currently under investigation by a House subcommittee. With
the anniversary less than 18 months away, the commission is
scrambling to get back on track.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Money troubles have caused some of the states to scale
back but not cancel their own quincentenary plans. "It's
really going to be a pretty sad state of affairs compared to
what it should be," says Florida state senator Curt Kiser of
his state's commemoration, which has fallen victim to a
budget crunch.
   Nor have corporate sponsors taken up the slack. Columbus
is a tough sell in board rooms when companies are laying off
workers, Mr. Kiser says.
   It doesn't help that the explorer has become a lightning
rod for ethnic sensitivities. Native Americans, Hispanics and
Italians have been squabbling over the revisionist view of
Columbus as a conquistador and despoiler who can hardly be
said to have discovered America. Accordingly, a delicate new
terminology has been crafted for all quincentenary discourse:
The "discovery" of America, for example, is now known as the
"encounter" of two cultures.
   With officialdom in disarray, it has fallen to certain
stalwarts to carry the torch for Columbus. One is Daniel
Amato, a member of the Knights of Columbus and a collector of
memorabilia from the 1893 Chicago world's fair that marked
Columbus's 400th anniversary -- a year late. Mr. Amato has
erected a Fiberglas statue of the explorer near his mall of
antique shops in Columbus, Wis. "Who's going to come to
Columbus, unless you promote Columbus?" he says.
   Then there is Anne Paolucci, a playwright and academic
whose New York organization, Columbus: Countdown 1992, has
commissioned literary and artistic works related to the
Columbus epic. "Our artists are doing marvelous things, yet
the flak is getting all the publicity," she says.
   Columbus, Ohio, is staging the only major exposition in
the U.S. Marjory Pizzuti, who is directing the city's
year-long tribute to its namesake, says she hopes to draw
tourists and make the city "more top-of-the-mind." Given what
she calls the "ambiguity" of the events of 1492, she also
sees it as a chance "to explore the good, the bad and the
ugly of what happened." Among the scheduled attractions
starting this October: a flower festival, a replica of the
flagship Santa Maria, body-building contests and -- to honor
the Italians' development of double-entry bookkeeping -- an
exhibit of "500 Years of Accounting."
   But few have displayed the zeal of Joseph Laufer. For the
past six years -- which is nearly as long as it took Columbus
to wheedle the money for his voyage from Queen Isabella --
Mr. Laufer has been engrossed in the quincentenary: issuing a
newsletter for fellow enthusiasts around the world, creating
a museum of Columbiana behind his Vincentown, N.J., house and
carrying his myth-busting version of the explorer's story to
gatherings of school-children.
   As he criss-crosses the country, he is amazed that
Columbus isn't more important to people than he is. "That's
where the commission totally let us down," he says. The
commission "didn't learn anything from Columbus. He was a
risk-taker. But, now, nobody wants to offend anybody, so as a
result we get nowhere."
   The commission, regrouping under new management, insists
it can turn things around and that hundreds of local events
will take place next year. Several newly announced national
projects seek private financing. Jim Kuhn, the new executive
director, says: "We're very positive about the direction
we're taking now."
   Mr. Laufer isn't holding his breath. After years of
pursuing his passion at his own expense (he is on leave from
a job as a community college administrator and $50,000 in
debt) he recently found a patron. "My Isabella," is his term
for New American Crossings, Inc., a Laguna Niguel, Calif.,
company that promotes quincentenary projects. It is
underwriting Mr. Laufer's speaking tour as a way of
displaying a mural reproduction of Emanuel Leutze's 1855
painting of Columbus's departure from Spain. The original,
owned by investors, is on loan to the Smithsonian
Institution. Mr. Laufer lugs the collapsible, 8-by-10-foot
copy with him wherever he goes.
   A recent stop on his mural tour was in Boalsburg, Pa., the
site of a strong tangible link to Christopher Columbus in the
New World. Columbus never set foot in sleepy Boalsburg, but
the contents of his family's chapel in northern Spain found
their way here in 1919. Col. Theodore Davis Boal had married
into the Columbus family while visiting Europe, and his wife,
Mathilde, inherited the chapel. The Boalsburg museum has been
designated a National Historic Site.
   Heirlooms include an admiral's desk, an explorer's cross
of the sort used to claim new territory, and two purported
fragments of the True Cross. Mr. Laufer was invited to kick
off a year and a half of quincentenary events in Boalsburg.
   The chapel is but one stop on Mr. Laufer's three-day swing
through Boalsburg. Dressed in his Columbus costume, fashioned
by the seamstress who makes his daughter's prom gowns, he
enthralls several hundred local schoolchildren with his
warts-and-all rendition of the explorer's life.
   Mr. Laufer faces up to the decimation of the Taino
population of the West Indies following Columbus's arrival
there, and to the environmental damage European settlement
brought. He talks about Columbus as a single parent who had
to leave his son, Diego, with Franciscan priests during his
voyages. As for Columbus's all-male crew, he explains: "They
didn't know about equal rights back then."
   Mr. Laufer is a middle-of-the-roader about Columbus; his
mission is more to educate than celebrate. Still, he has
little sympathy for the Columbus-bashers who would belittle
the explorer's achievements. "You can't lay everything at the
footsteps of Columbus or the Spanish," he says.
   Like others associated with the quincentenary, he has
learned to watch his language. He avoids the word
"discovery," with its Eurocentric bias. "Celebration" and
"melting pot" are other taboos.
   However, he says he drew the line when the National Park
Service tried to edit a passage in the children's activity
manual he wrote for the agency. In it, he had Columbus
bestowing the name "Indians" on the natives of what he
thought were the Indies. The Park Service wanted to have
Columbus name them "Native Americans."

U.S. PAVILION AT EXPO '92 A VICTIM OF FEDERAL BUDGET CUT;

DESIGN: L.A. ARCHITECT IS 'APPALLED' THAT THE NATION WON'T BE AT SPAIN'S FAIR 
MARKING AMERICA'S DISCOVERY.

<P>
Expo '92, the major world's fair planned for Seville, Spain, will celebrate the 
500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America -- and it looks like the 
United States of America will not be represented. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the $30-million Seville U.S. pavilion, designed by a Los Angeles team 
led by architects Barton Myers Associates, has been cut from the federal 
budget. The bill that created funding for the pavilion was eliminated from the 
1990 federal appropriations measure recently passed by both houses of Congress 
and signed into law by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The pavilion's funding is a victim of the struggle to balance the federal 
budget. Rep. Neil Smith (D-Iowa), chairman of a House subcommittee that 
oversees the U.S. Information Agency, declared that Seville "is a low priority 
for taxpayers' money at a time when lawmakers are trying to reduce the 
deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Barton Myers said he is "frankly appalled" at the government's 
failure to fund the project. Myers' design, which won a national architectural 
competition and has been widely praised by critics across the country, has now 
missed the ground-breaking deadline set for this spring on the Expo '92 site, 
an island in the Guadalquivir River. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret that the U.S., alone among the world's major nations, may well 
fail to be represented at Seville, in a fair that highlights the Age of 
Discovery," Myers said. "This is despite the fact that President Reagan wrote 
personally to King Juan Carlos promising that the U.S. would most certainly be 
present in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
About 110 countries have committed to build pavilions at the fair site. Among 
the nations that will not be represented are South Africa, Albania, Iraq, Syria 
and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Myers' design for the Seville U.S. pavilion imaginatively develops the fair's 
theme of discovery. Passing through an entry under a wall of water, visitors 
cross a bridge over an "ocean," which symbolizes Columbus' voyages to the New 
World. Inside the pavilion three high-tech, sun-tracking "shade sails" invoke 
images of Columbus' vessels: the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty pylons, representing the states, double as cooling towers that draw hot, 
dry air through a layer of moistened pads. This energy-saving device avoids the 
need for air conditioning in the Andalusian summer and demonstrates American 
ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
If the pavilion is to be built after all, it will either require a special 
federal appropriation or its backers will have to seek private-sector funding, 
Myers said. Even if the private sector can be persuaded to fund the pavilion, 
whose construction would have to be rushed, Myers questioned whether the United 
States should be represented at this major international fair by private 
interests rather than a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
USIA officials in Washington declined to comment on the pavilion situation. 
Agency spokesman Frank Johnson said it is "hopeful" that funding will be found 
in time for a fall start on construction. 
</P>
<P>
Peter L. Spurney, a Washington fair-management specialist involved with Expo 
'92, said, "Seville will reflect what's going on in Europe in 1992. Like it or 
not, it's going to be the place to be." 
</P>
<P>
But not, it seems, for the United States. As Heller remarked, "the U.S. effort 
in Seville is so far dead in the water."

<LEADPARA>  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, and the 90 men who sailed the three ships under his
command, set out on their famous voyage 499 years ago this weekend, Aug. 3,
1492.;    We know many things about Columbus and his "discovery" of the New
World. We know, for example, that he had red hair, blue eyes and was at least
6 feet tall (almost a giant by the standards of his day). We don't know much
more about his appearance because not a single portrait was ever painted of
him during his life.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We also know that Columbus was far from alone in believing the Earth was
round. It was pretty well taken for granted during his time, although Columbus
thought the Earth was much smaller than the size estimated by most scholars of
the day, and on this point he was dead wrong.;    Columbus believed in the
"big Asia, small Atlantic" theory, and argued that China and Japan lay just
2,000 miles or so west of Spain. Actually, a westward voyage to Asia would
have been at least 10,000 miles long, and had not Columbus accidentally bumped
into the New World, he and his crew would surely have died of thirst and never
merited so much as a footnote in our history books.;    WHAT many of our
children don't know about Columbus, though, is just why he set out on this
perilous voyage in the first place. And it is just this type of inquiry that
can help all of us imbue our children with a "sense" of history, by which I
mean a feeling for the flesh-and-blood human beings that seem so lifeless or
so immortal when they are portrayed in our children's history texts.;    It
takes great imagination to picture oneself as living during the times of
various historic events, but this is just what children must do if they are
ever to see history as being more than a boring collection of facts and dates,
and if they are ever to use the lessons of history to guide their own lives.; 
  Children take refrigerated food and frozen dinners for granted, but can they
imagine what meals must have been like in Columbus' time, when salt was the
only known preservative and when most foods -- especially meats -- arrived at
the table already spoiled and tasting of decay?;    Perhaps they can
understand then why spices -- especially pepper -- were, quite literally,
worth their weight in gold. Pepper and nutmeg and cloves could mask the awful
taste and smell of spoiled food, but these spices were found only in the Spice
Islands and the Orient, and so Europeans had to pay dearly for them to be
transported across Asia.;     COLUMBUS convinced the king and queen of Spain
that he could reach these spice-bearing lands from the other direction, and
throughout his life he maintained that he had done just that, refusing to
believe that he had discovered anything new.;    To help your children get
better acquainted with their own senses of smell and taste, make sure they
know that these two senses are related: It is very difficult to taste anything
that you cannot smell. Put a clip on your child's nose and then put a few
grains of fresh ground coffee in his mouth. Can he taste what he is chewing?
Then have him remove the clip and feel the instantaneous rush of flavor that
accompanies the return of his sense of smell.  </TEXT>

   How's this for revisionist history? The
pilgrims sailed to America in the Pinto. Paul Revere wrote ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' Sandra Day O'Connor is chief justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   And Gen. Douglas MacArthur said, ``Give me liberty or give me
death.'' Or was it Martin Luther King Jr.?
   These are samplings of responses from community-college students
to questions that might be asked of immigrants seeking U.S.
citizenship.
   Just five of 119 students at Bellevue Community College managed
a passing grade of 70 percent or better.
   ``This is pretty bad,'' said Aslam Khan, head of the college's
political science department, who administered the test.
   ``Why should we give these questions to foreigners when our own
citizens don't know what is going on?'' asked the Pakistan-born
Khan, who took such a test when he became a naturalized citizen.
   Less than half the students knew that the supreme law of the
land is the Constitution.
   When asked what kind of government the United States has, many
answered ``capitalist,'' rather than a democracy.
   Some said the pilgrims left Europe because they were searching
for something to colonize, apparently forgetting the religious
persecution that prompted them to flee to the New World.
   A decade ago, Khan gave a similar test of 10 questions to 118
students. Six passed.
   ``It's not getting any better,'' he said.
   It may be good for a few snickers when a student identifies
Abraham Lincoln as the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, but when only one student answers 29 of the 30
questions correctly and just 18 get 60 percent right, everybody
should be concerned, Khan said.
   ``I think people should know what is going on in this country,''
he said. ``We really do need a course in remedial American
Government.''
   For the record:
   _ The Pinta, not the Pinto, was one of three ships used by
Christopher Columbus, along with the Nina and the Santa Maria. The
pilgrims sailed in the Mayflower.
   _ Francis Scott Key wrote the national anthem, while Paul Revere
warned American revolutionaries the British were coming.
   _ Ms. O'Connor is the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court,
which has yet to have a woman chief justice.
   _ Patrick Henry preferred death over tyranny in his famous to
the Virginia House of Burgesses, while MacArthur is remembered for
pledging ``I shall return'' to the Philippines and civil-rights
leader King for his ``I have a dream'' speech.

FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (9): Columbus fever runs high -
Canute James looks forward to the celebrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A low hill overlooking the harbour in Santo Domingo, capital of the
Dominican Republic, teams of workmen are scrambling over a massive concrete
structure that was designed 43 years ago. The government hopes it will be
completed this year.
The Columbus Lighthouse, a monument whose completion is costing millions of
dollars, is central to much that is happen- ing in the country this year.
The lighthouse is the most ambitious part of the country's commemoration -
celebration, says the official literature - of the arrival of Christopher
Columbus in the Caribbean 500 years ago.
Columbus fever is running high in the country. One weekend earlier this
month, thousands of Dominicans flocked to the port in Santo Domingo to view
the replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa Maria, Columbus's famed
boats, which were on a short visit.
'This will be a good year for this country,' says the head of a local
business group. 'We are celebrating a milestone.'
Preparations for the event are evident all over Santo Domingo. Roads and
bridges are being improved, the colonial section of the city is being
rebuilt and efforts are under way to improve the electricity supply. The
administrators of the country's tourist industry expect an increase in the
volume of visitors, drawn by the focus on Columbus.
Cynics and the political cognoscenti concur that 500 years after he arrived,
Columbus still has a profound effect on contemporary Dominican politics.
They say Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the president, was determined to stand again
for office in the 1990 elections simply to be in charge of this year's
events.
According to the Dominican Commission for the Celeb- ration of the
Quincentenary, La Isabela, established on Hispaniola by Columbus on his
second voyage, was the 'first seat of western civilisation in America,' and
produced 'the miracle that today we call America.'
It was the Dominican Republic, according to the commission, which was the
centre of the transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America'.
The country, it says, was the site of the first mass celebrated in the
Americas, the first munic- ipality, the first city, the first viceregal
court, the first university and the first cathedral in which, incid-
entally, Columbus is buried until his remains are moved to the lighthouse
which is being built.
Dominicans appear oblivious to the consternation which they have created in
other parts of the region, not by their claim on Columbus, but because of
the language which they use. There is little tolerance of suggestions that
the use of the word 'discovery' is eschewed by most of their neighbours who
prefer to 'commemorate' the event as an 'encounter' of Europe with the
Americas.
'Of course there were people here when Columbus got here,' agrees the
business leader. 'But if he did not discover them no one would have known
they were here. He brought them Christianity and civilisation. I must be
thankful. I would not be here if it had not been for Columbus.'

<LEADPARA>  THE 1992 Expo will be a major test for Seville, the capital of Andalusia and a
city infamous for its street crimes against tourists. It will be interesting
to see if the city can put a lid on the thousands of pickpockets, petty

<TEXT>     During Spain's age of discovery -- and before the Quadalquivar River silted
up -- Seville was the headquarters for European trade with the New World, by
decree of Ferdinand and Isabella.;    Seville has other claims to fame. It's
the flamenco capital of the world. The cigar factory where Bizet's Carmen did
her thing is here, and it's also the setting for two other famous operas --
"The Marriage of Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." Seville is building an
opera house for these and other offerings. The new Teatro de la Maestranza is
supposed to be ready by May, with Spanish tenor Placido Domingo as operatic
director.;    And one of the most important collections of historical
documents in Europe is found here, the Indies Archives, housed in a building
near the cathedral. The collection -- with nearly 50,000 files -- includes
maps, charts and letters from Columbus, Magellan, Cortes and other great
Spanish explorers. One of the goals of the Spanish government this year and
next is to computerize the files.;    Tourists planning to stop in on the
world's fair will find rooms hard to come by. Emilio Casinello, who's in
charge of the Expo, says some visitors might have to stay two or three hours
outside of town, but there will be rooms for everyone.;    The fair runs from
April 20 to Oct. 12, and more than 100 countries are expected to participate.
The U.S. Congress has appropriated $13 million for the Seville fair and
another $1.5 million for another Columbus celebration to be held next summer
in Genoa, Italy.;    Monastery restored;  The Expo site -- La Cartuja island
in the Quadalquivar River -- covers about 530 acres. The 15th-century
monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas, once the only building on island, is
being restored, and its outer lodge will become a royal pavilion where King
Juan Carlos will receive visiting dignitaries. Columbus supposedly lived at
the monastery for eight years.;    The biggest foreign pavilions will be those
of Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. Spain hopes the
Expo will attract about 20 million visitors during its six-month run, half of
those foreigners. Seville, the same size as San Jose, is the smallest city
ever to host a world's fair.;    Like Barcelona, Seville is a city under siege
by construction workers. Spanish government investment now totals about $1.5
billion on the actual Expo site, with $7 billion more being spent on roads,
rail and other infrastructure.;    Twenty new hotels are under way, and by
next spring, officials are forecasting a total of 75,000 beds (current hotel
capacity in Seville is about 10,000). Another 100,000 beds will be offered in
homes and apartments within an hour and a half of the city, and 600,000 more
beds are two and a half hours away on the Costa del Sol.;    Officials in
Seville say they plan to ask local citizens to rent out their extra bedrooms
as part of a bed-and-breakfast program. Information about such programs should
be available from the Spanish National Tourist Office in Beverly Hills, but
calls there often result in "we don't know" responses.;    New rail service; 
Also by next April, Spain hopes to begin high-speed rail service between
Madrid and Seville using trains that will cut the journey from six hours to
two hours and 45 minutes. The service, to be known as AVE, after its Spanish
name, Tren de Alta Velocidad Espa ola, will travel at up to 186 miles an hour.
There will be an AVE terminal at the Expo site.;    The high-speed trains will
have air-conditioned cars and a cafe car with telephones and a boutique.
Between 10 and 14 daily departures in each direction are planned, but
schedules and fares have yet to be announced. And work is proceeding on a new
airport terminal that is hoped to triple passenger capacity.;    Also next
year, an antique train, the Andalusian Express, will begin service that
includes a trip from Madrid to Seville on the AVE plus the train's normal
summer run from Seville to Cordoba, Granada and Malaga and back to Seville.;  
 The Expo might make or break Seville. Andalusia in general -- and Seville in
particular -- are in bad economic shape. Spanish officials hope the fair will
attract future investments to the city and the province -- hence the big money
being put into fixing up the infrastructure.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For
general information about Andalusia and the Seville region, contact the
Spanish National Tourist Office, 8383 Wilshire Blvd., No. 960, Beverly Hills
90211; (213) 658-7188. Among events planned for next year are:;    (check)

maritime activities and on Columbus himself.;    (check) GRAND REGATTA
COLUMBUS '92 -- Puerto Rico, May-June 1992. A fleet of tall sailing ships and
hundreds of pleasure craft will sail from Cadiz and arrive at San Juan in May
1992. There will be events in San Juan June 10-14.;    (check) 1992 SUMMER
OLYMPICS -- Barcelona, July 25-Aug. 9, 1992. The games are dedicated to
Columbus.;     If you go . . .; (check) Expo Factos -- The 1992 world's fair
will stay open late -- probably 4 a.m. -- to cope with July temperatures that
often soar above 100 degrees. A one-day ticket is about $40 per person.;   
Visitors may enter and leave the site any time between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Pavilions will be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. A night-time ticket for $10
will allow entry from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. Evening activities include a parade,
laser and fireworks display over the Expo lake, concerts, theater, dance
programs, cinema programs, discos and night clubs.;    Many attractions and
pavilions will focus on progress. Included among facilities on the island will
be a monorail to take visitors around the exhibition, and a cable car linking
the fair site with the city. Fair officials plan to plant 350,000 trees and
bushes and 30 miles of hedge to create a screen of vegetation against the
fierce heat.;    (check) COLUMBUS TRACKING -- If you want to see the Columbus
crypt, go to the vast Gothic cathedral in Seville, which holds the ornate tomb
built to hold Columbus' remains. The cathedral is said to be the third largest

   Today is Thursday, August 3, the 215th day of 1989. There are
150 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On August 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Palos,
Spain, with three ships _ the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria _
on a voyage that would take him to the New World.
   On this date:
   In 1914, Germany declared war on France at the outset of World
War I.
   In 1921, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Landis refused to
reinstate the former Chicago White Sox players implicated in the
Black Sox scandal, despite their acquittals in a jury trial.
   In 1923, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as the 30th President of
the United States, following the death of Warren G. Harding.
   In 1936, the U.S. State Department urged Americans in Spain to
leave because of that country's civil war.
   In 1943, during World War II, Gen. George S. Patton slapped a GI
at an army hospital in Sicily, accusing him of cowardice.
   In 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former Communist, publicly
accused former State Department official Alger Hiss of having been
part of a Communist underground, a charge Hiss has always denied.
   In 1949, the National Basketball Association was formed by a
merger of the Basketball Association of America and the National
Basketball League.
   In 1958, the nuclear-powered submarine Nautilus became the first
vessel to cross the North Pole under water.
   In 1977, death claimed Archbishop Makarios, president of the
island nation of Cyprus since its beginning in 1960, at age 63, and
Broadway star Alfred Lunt at age 84.
   In 1981, U.S. air traffic controllers went on strike, defying a
warning from President Reagan that they would be fired if they did
not return to work.
   In 1987, the congressional Iran-Contra hearings ended, with none
of the 29 witnesses tying President Reagan directly to the use of
arms-sales profits for the rebels fighting in Nicaragua.
   Ten years ago: Chrysler Corporation, plagued by record losses,
asked the United Auto Workers union for an unprecedented two-year
freeze on wages and benefits, a proposal immediately rejected by
UAW president Douglas Fraser.
   Five years ago: At the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, Mary Lou
Retton won the gold medal in the individual all-around event in
women's gymnastics by nailing a perfect 10 on the vault in her
final routine.
   One year ago: The Soviet Union released Mathias Rust, the young
West German pilot who had landed a light plane in Moscow's Red
Square in May 1987. Striking screenwriters reached a tentative
agreement with motion picture and television producers, effectively
ending a 150-day walkout.
   Today's Birthdays: Former Senator John Stennis, D-Miss., is 88.
Author Leon Uris is 65. Singer Tony Bennett is 63. Actor Martin
Sheen is 49. Movie director John Landis is 39.
   Thought for Today: ``The man who has no inner life is the slave
of his surroundings.'' _ Henri Frederic Amiel, Swiss critic
(1821-1881).

   Today is Wednesday, August 3, 216th day of 1988. There are 150
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Forty years ago, on August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers, an
editor for Time magazine and a former Communist, publicly accused
former State Department official Alger Hiss of having been part of
a Communist underground in the United States in the 1930s. Although
Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted of perjury and served
44 months in prison.
   On this date:
   In 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Palos, Spain, with
three ships _ the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria _ on a voyage
that would take him to the New World.
   In 1914, Germany declared war on France at the outset of World
War I.
   In 1923, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as the 30th president of
the United States after the death of Warren G. Harding.
   In 1936, the U.S. State Department urged Americans in Spain to
leave because of that country's civil war.
   In 1943, during World War II, Gen. George S. Patton slapped a
soldier at an army hospital in Sicily, accusing him of cowardice.
(Patton later apologized for this incident and a second, similar
episode.)
   In 1949, the National Basketball Association was formed by a
merger of the Basketball Association of America and the National
Basketball League.
   In 1958, the nuclear-powered submarine Nautilus became the first
vessel to cross the North Pole under water.
   In 1977, death claimed Archbishop Makarios, president of the

gold medal in the individual all-around event in women's gymnastics.
   Ten years ago: A bomb exploded in Tel Aviv's Carmel Market,
killing an Israeli and wounding dozens of others. Within hours,
Israeli jets raided a target in Lebanon described as a Palestinian
guerrilla training camp.
   Five years ago: President Reagan appeared before a professional
women's group meeting in Washington to personally apologize for a
canceled White House tour, but the gesture apparently backfired.
The audience reacted stonily as Reagan said, ``If it wasn't for
women, us men would still be walking around in skin suits carrying
clubs.''
   One year ago: The congressional Iran-Contra hearings came to a
quiet end, with none of the 29 witnesses having tied President
Reagan directly to the use of arms-sales profits for the rebels
fighting in Nicaragua.
   Today's birthdays: Sen. John Stennis, D- Miss., is 87. Author
Leon Uris is 64. Singer Tony Bennett is 62. Actor Martin Sheen is
48. Movie director John Landis (``Animal House'') is 38.
   Thought for today: ``I am more and more convinced that man is a
dangerous creature; and that power, whether vested in many or a
few, is ever grasping, and like the grave, cries `Give, give!''' _

The Great Columbus Chase  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Arawak men, women and children stumble away, blood gushing from stumps --
in punishment for failing to meet the impossible gold-dust quotas of
Christopher Columbus and his crew.;    It is the beginning of Columbus'
voyages to the Americas. And this unholy scene, repeated on later journeys, is
spun from Europe's lust for gold and the Spanish desire for Christian
converts. This is the Eden-turned-hell that Columbus misnames "the New
World.";    But in reality, it is an ancient, well-populated world. What
Columbus did not find in gold or converts, say some historians and social
critics, he made up for in blood: the enslavement and murder of the Taino and
Arawak peoples.;    "The historical facts are on record," says Hans Koning,
author of "Columbus: His Enterprise." "We've told our children he was a great
hero -- that's total hokum pokum. Columbus was not a force for the good. If an
entire race stood in his way, it had to go.";    This increasingly negative
reassessment of Columbus is igniting a passionate international controversy
over the 1992 celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Columbus voyage.;   
To celebrate the anniversary, a presidential commission was created by
Congress in 1984 to coordinate activities in the United States and cooperate
with European planners. The organization -- the Quincentenary Jubilee
Commission -- drew fire from the beginning because no Indians were included on
the 30-member commission. There are four Hispanics, one African-American and
10 Italian-Americans on the panel.;    Commission Director James Kuhn
downplays the question of the panel's racial makeup, saying, "We don't think
of it in these terms.";    But there are many critics who do. "Where's the
native point of view?" asks LaDonna Harris, a Comanche and founder of
Americans for Indian Opportunity in Washington, D.C.;    Meanwhile, on both
sides of the Atlantic, officials and hawkers are planning parties, media
events and T-shirt sales. Replicas of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
will be displayed in San Francisco in October 1992, after touring other
cities.;    "And guess what flag they'll be flying -- the Texaco flag," says
Roberto Ramirez of the South Bay Quincentennial Indigenous Council. "This
commercialization represents the mentality behind the official celebration."; 
  For Ramirez and others, 1992 is the remembrance of a holocaust in which
people were raped, tortured and killed. All for the sake of gold that wasn't
there and a religion that converted not a single Indian.;    "Five hundred
years of genocide is not a cause for celebration," says Charley Trujillo, a
San Jose publisher, author and historian. "We're supposed to celebrate a
holocaust? It's unthinkable.";    "It's like asking the world to celebrate
Hitler's holocaust of the Jewish people," says Rosemary Richmond, of the
American Indian Community House in New York. "I am an American Indian; this is
not my party.";    In response to increasing objection to the term
"celebration," Kuhn of the Jubilee Commission has said: "We don't call it a
celebration. We call it a commemoration.";    But critics still say things
smack of a celebration. For them, 1992 is instead a time to protest, to mourn,
to educate.;    "What must be done in 1992," says Carlos Munoz, a UC-Berkeley
professor of political history, "is writing letters to the editor, protesting
official Columbus events, alerting educators and commemorating the original
Americans in an alternative historical perspective.";    Welcome to the
alternative quincentennial movement and its growing thunder, as it rumbles
across all borders of race, religion and rank. For starters:;    (check) In
Spain, the mayor of Cadiz has donated land for a monument to the victims of
European conquerors.;    (check) In Cuba, the 1991 Fourth Havana Biennial has
declared a "Challenge to Colonization.";    (check) At Stanford University,
artist-writer Jose Antonio Burciaga is distributing Koning's book as "chain"
gifts to be passed on every two weeks: "People need to know what happened in
1492 so they can figure what to do in 1992.";    (check) And from the Submuloc
Society (Columbus spelled backward) at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo,
Mont., the movement has a T-shirt: three ships within a circle crossed by a
diagonal line -- the international symbol for "not allowed.";   
Demonstrations began last year when activists, including Indian leader Russell
Means, protested a traveling Columbus exhibit called "First Encounters,"
created by the Florida Museum of Natural History.;    "The exhibit should have
shown colonialism at work," says protest organizer Jan Elliott of the
Committee for American Indian History in Gainesville, Fla.;    An Indian
demonstrator was accused of "spoiling our children's fun." But, says Koning,
who was there, 'It's not innocent pleasure to celebrate an appalling
history.";    In response, the Houston Museum of Natural Science has canceled
the exhibit. Its next stop is the Southwest Museum of Science and Technology
in Dallas on Sept. 26, where a protest will be staged Oct. 12 by Elliott's
coalition.;    "If people ask, 'What have you got against Columbus?' -- they
don't know about the lie of Columbus," says Elliott, a Cherokee Creole and
Ph.D candidate in Indian philosophy.;    But no protests are planned for the
Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul. Its curator of ethnology, Dan Swan,
is working closely with Indians to illuminate the exhibit's eurocentrism and
to offer a multicultural perspective.;    Similarly in San Jose, Jorge
Gonzales is part of Santa Clara County's multiethnic, multiracial commission
to develop a multicultural response. "An objective is to include the
indigenous perspective," Gonzales says.;    Gonzales is a member of Raza Si,
an immigrant-rights advocacy organization, and the South Bay Quincentennial
Indigenous Council. On Tuesday the council will have a traditional Indian
feast, open to the public, at Mother Olson's Inn in San Jose.;    "Native
people are taking a stand," says Norma Sanchez of the Muwekma-Ohlone Tribe,
who estimates 16,000 Indians live in Santa Clara County. "We will not
celebrate colonialism, but we will help people gain new understanding.";   
About 10,000 Ohlones live in the United States, according to Rosemary Cambra
of the Muwekma-Ohlone Tribe. "Hayward State University and UC-Berkeley are
planning Ohlone exhibits as part of an alternative response," she reports.;   
Likewise, Hugh Wire of the Council of Churches in Santa Clara County says, "In
1992, we'll work toward a restoration of Native American pride.";    From New
York, the National Council of Churches calls the Jubilee a legitimization "of
racial oppression" and vows to protest it through observances and events
across the nation.;    In cities where the indigenous perspective is ignored,
activists plan demonstrations through 1992. "We may greet the ships in San
Francisco naked with our feathers and rubber-tipped bows and arrows," Elliott
says.;    In New York, the Solidarity Foundation plans a festival in Central
Park to counter the arrival of the tall ships in the harbor.;    Another
target is Columbus Day, Oct. 12. Indians object to glorifying a man they call
a false hero. The 1992 Alliance in Washington, D.C., plans a sunrise ceremony
this Columbus Day in front of the capitol.;    "We're declaring 1992 the Year
of the Indigenous People," says Suzan Harjo, a Cheyenne and Creek Indian and
Alliance national coordinator. "We'll remember those who didn't survive the
European invasion; we'll celebrate those who have survived.";    Others are
declaring Oct. 13 a Day of Mourning. Still others are calling for a moment to
an hour of silence on Oct. 12. Another plan is to celebrate Oct. 11 as Native
People's Last Day of Freedom.;    Last year, the American Indian Movement in
Denver protested Columbus Day and unveiled an effigy of Hitler next to
Columbus' statue. Elliott's group will continue protesting a planned $100,000
Columbus statue in Corpus Christi, Texas.;    Writer Jack Weatherford proposes
abolishing Columbus Day. Why honor a man "who opened the Atlantic slave trade
and launched one of the greatest waves of genocide known in history?" he
writes.;    "This gathering storm has already made an impact," says
Kirkpatrick Sale, author of "The Conquest of Paradise." "That's why the
national celebration is failing to get off the ground. There's an awareness
that celebration is not a moral response to 1992.";    A moral response is the
counter-movement's call to action.;    Already there are plans for educational
conferences. Sale attended such a meeting of the National Society of Social
Studies Teachers. "To their credit," he says, "they're perplexed over how to
present the quincentenary to students. They realize a celebration is
inappropriate.";    Also at issue is the grade school notion of Columbus
'discovering' America. Elliott calls it "the myth of an empty continent.";   
"Colon did not discover it," Sale writes. It was "well-known to the millions
of people . . . who had discovered (it) on behalf of the human species tens of
thousands of years before.";    Apologists for the "discovery" notion excuse
the term because the land was new to Columbus. But Richmond says, "If I step
off a ship in France, I do not 'discover' it, even if it's 'new' to me.";   
Eurocentric racism feeds this myth, says Peter McDonald, former Native
American Indian bibliographer at New York Public Library, now with Cornell
University's Northeast Indian Quarterly.;    "The idea of a white person
'discovering' a continent -- already populated from sea to shining sea -- is
absurd," McDonald says. "The Incas, the Aztecs had astronomy, engineering,
mathematics, hygiene, an agriculture far in advance of anything in Europe.";  
 The myth of Columbus, he adds, "numbs us to the truth of how this continent
was stolen in a ruthless expanse, leaving a trail of broken promises leading
up to today.";    In response to such criticism, Jubilee commissioner Kuhn has
said: "I may have said discovery in the past, but now I refer to it as an
encounter.";    "Calling it an 'encounter' is an attempt to hoodwink people,"
McDonald says. "Raping, murdering, enslaving people is hardly an 'encounter'
of two cultures.";    Meanwhile, Hollywood is producing two Columbus films,
one written by Mario Puzo and the other directed by Ridley Scott. Activists
don't expect either to tell the true tale of Christopher Columbus. However,
Koning says, "Actor Tim Robbins has written a play based on my book, and he
hopes to talk to Ridley Scott about it.";    Whatever happens during the next
year and a half, Sale says, "when Columbus is talked about from now on, it
will be with a greater awareness.";    Adds Koning, "It may seem a pity to let
go of Columbus as part of our national lore, but we cannot in good faith
celebrate this man nor the quincentenary. False heroes have too long burdened
our history. If people really want to do something in 1992, tell them to talk
with a Native American.";    It's a good idea, says June LeGrand, radio host
for "The Living Spirit" on KKUP-FM and co-founder of the South Bay
Quincentennial Indigenous Council.;    "We've been invisible for so long.
Until the world heals its relationship to Indian people, there can be no
harmony on Earth. 1992 offers us a chance to finally meet all of our brothers
and sisters."  </TEXT>

TREASURE HUNT  </HEADLINE>

Francisco State University. She is this year's winner of the reviewing

<TEXT>  HarperCollins, 384 pp., $21.95;  THERE has already been a lot of hype about
"The Crown of Columbus," and there is probably going to be a lot more. The
novel sold for an enormous amount of money (the advance alone was an
unprecedented three-quarters of a million dollars). The Book-of-the-Month Club
has bid on it, so have the magazines and translators; Michelle Pfeiffer owns
the movie rights.;    The authors, Michael Dorris and Louise Erdrich, are
already on a national publicity tour. Handsome and appealing, they make fine
spokespeople for their own work and provide unusually interesting copy for
articles and interviews. Both are of mixed American Indian descent, and both
grew up, at least partly, on reservations. They have been married 10 years and
are raising six children together. Prize-winning authors on their own
(Erdrich's "Love Medicine" won the National Book Critics Circle Award for
Fiction in 1984, and Dorris' "The Broken Cord" won the National Book Critics
Circle Award for Non-Fiction in 1989), the two are used to reading and
commenting on each other's work, but they have never openly collaborated on a
full-length book before.;    And the book? Well, it's great. "The Crown of
Columbus" feels exactly like the family-written book it is. Unpretentious and
engaging, it has more charm and humor than readers may have found in earlier
Dorris and/or Erdrich works, without sacrificing any of the intelligence or
feeling. The very first sentence ("In the warm pink-gold of a Caribbean
afternoon, something marvelous washed up from the sea") sets the tone, and
this light and literate quality lasts throughout the book.;    The plot
focuses on the on-again, off-again romance between two very different
Dartmouth professors as they try to second-guess Christopher Columbus -- who
he was, what he wanted, what his legacy to America really consisted of.;   
Vivian Twostar, who narrates part of the book, is a spunky, outspoken
40-year-old single mother who teaches American Indian studies in the
anthropology department. Forced by the requirements of her tenure year to
write an article on Columbus, whom she refers to sarcastically as "Mr.
Navigator," Vivian begins her research with reluctance. She wants what every
"other sensible person of full or partial American Indian descent" wants --
that is, she wants to nail him.;    Vivian has a clear idea of what life was
like for her people before Columbus landed. The Indians on the tiny island of
Guanahani, in the Bahamas, were, she tells us, "a healthy pleasure-loving
group, laid-back beach bums and surfers, with absolutely no aptitude for
destruction." They lived in "an endless summer of surf and starry nights"
until, in 1492, the fateful sails of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
appeared on the horizon. Then, Vivian fumes, they all ran down to meet the
ships -- they had, after all, no reason to think the Spaniards weren't simply
bringing "more good news.";    Roger Williams, an elegant, emotionally inept
academician who talks to students and fellow professors using the "odd,
two-fingered hand position Christ used in Bible story illustrations," is
writing about Columbus for different reasons: He is interested in the man as
an Italian who sailed for Spain, a Jew who converted to Christianity, a
navigator who never found the "Orient" he aimed for. Roger, a narrative poet,
is writing an unrhymed monologue titled "Diary of a Lost Man" that starts with
Columbus' admission: "I do not know myself.";    The two, Roger and Vivian,
have a comic confrontation in the Dartmouth library when Roger's cough alerts
Vivian's anger. "The first European who stood on the North American continent
and coughed," Vivian remembers, "probably indirectly killed more Indians than
. . . Custer ever imagined in his favorite wet dream." They fall in love, but
break apart when Vivian learns she is pregnant. They stay apart until Roger
learns to develop "a tolerance for change" that includes accepting Vivian, her
teen-age son Nash ("just spell it G-N-A-S-H"), her irritable Navajo
grandmother and their new baby, Violet -- the "whole unruly entourage.";    In
the meantime, both continue to track down information on Columbus. They agree
on one fact: Columbus was a slave trader. The gold he failed to find in the
New World he supplanted with natives he bragged would make "good and
intelligent servants" for Spain.;    But what are these references to a
mysterious "crown" in the journals and notes? When a sinister millionaire
named Cobb offers to help put the pieces together, Vivian, Roger, Nash and the
baby fly to his mansion in the Bahamas. Roger sees nothing but fleas and
mosquitoes on the tropical island, and Vivian's view is also bleak: The "poor
soil, bright colors, dark people, junked automobiles" all remind her of a
reservation. Cobb's private beach is, however, the promised paradise. And as
Cobb's clues tally with Vivian's, the race to find the "real" Columbus speeds
up.;     "The Crown of Columbus" is an old-fashioned treasure-hunt story that
offers a little bit for everyone -- there are bats, sharks, caves,
kidnappings, codes and karate chops, as well as poems by Donne and Roger
Williams, entries from Columbus' diary, Navajo chants and wonderful
descriptions of university librarians, childbirth and stoned 16-year-old boys.
The only thing missing is the recipe for Vivian's chili.;     There are, to be
sure, some flat parts and some thin characters. Columbus himself remains sadly
elusive. There is a Nancy Drew-gets-together-with-the-Hardy-Boys quality that
may put off the sophisticated. But the good spirit of the book is contagious,
and that, essentially, is what makes it so effective.;    "The Crown of
Columbus" feels as if it was written in fun, conceived and constructed in an
atmosphere of camaraderie, respect and good faith. If only Columbus had landed
on our shores with half these qualities . . .  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Three Viking ships sailed up the Potomac River on Wednesday, commemorating
Leif Ericson's landing in the New World about 1,000 years ago and challenging
the 500th anniversary hoopla celebrating that Christopher-come-lately.;   The
78-foot flagship Gaia, a replica of the wooden, single-masted Viking longboat,
docked at a Georgetown wharf shortly before noon on Leif Ericson Day after a
5,300-mile voyage across the North Atlantic that began May 17 in Bergen,
Norway.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Gaia and two Viking escort vessels that joined the voyage at Nova
Scotia were greeted by noisy blasts from ancient Norse birch-bark horns and
cheers from a dockside crowd that included President Vigdis Finnbogadottir of
Iceland and Queen Sonja of Norway.;   Also welcoming the Norse sailors was
former Vice President Walter Mondale, a Minnesotan of Norwegian stock. Playing
it safe, he praised the epic voyages of both Ericson and Christopher Columbus
as "victories of the human spirit.";   Speaking to a reporter, Mondale
recalled being spanked as a child for bragging, but on this occasion he
couldn't resist.;   "We got here 500 years early," he said, beaming. "We
didn't need any money. We just did it.";   No one knows exactly when or where
Ericson landed in the New World. Many scholars believe the Vikings reached the
northern coast of Newfoundland about 1,000 years ago and settled there for a
year before returning home.;   Ericson called the place "Vinland."
Archaeologists have found the remains of an early Viking settlement at
L'Anse-aux-Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland but none of the grape
vines that Ericson is said to have found there.;   After the speechmaking and
a celebratory lunch, the Icelandic president and the Norwegian queen paid a
courtesy call on President Bush at the White House, thus deftly upstaging
Cristobal Colon, a 20th-generation direct descendant of Columbus.;   Colon, a
42-year-old Spanish naval officer, wasn't scheduled to meet Bush until today.
He is touring the United States to help celebrate Columbus Day and launch
yearlong festivities celebrating the 500th anniversary of his ancestor's
landing in the New World.;   The Smithsonian Institution is sponsoring a
variety of Columbus anniversary events, and the National Gallery of Art on
Saturday will open its blockbuster "Circa 1492" exhibition of artworks from
the Columbus era. King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain got a sneak
preview of the exhibit Tuesday.  </TEXT>

<P>
Is there room on the Atlantic Ocean -- and on the big screen -- for two 
Christopher Columbuses? 
</P>
<P>
There was room last week in the trade papers for splashy multi-page ads touting 
two such projects, both to be released in 1992 to capitalize on the 500th 
anniversary of the Italian explorer's voyage to North America in the service of 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind are working with a script by Mario Puzo, 
"Christopher Columbus: The Movie," with plans to begin shooting in April. They 
claim to have "exclusive" access to Spain's full-size re-creations of the Nina, 
Pinta and Santa Maria, now under construction. The father-and-son team 
responsible for the "Superman" movies will also "use members of the Spanish 
navy as extras," a spokesman tells us. 
</P>
<P>
To be budgeted at $45-$50 million, the Salkinds' film is planned as a July 4, 
1992, global release, with Universal Pictures handling domestic distribution. A 
source reports that David Lean is being considered as director. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, producer-director Ridley Scott plans "Christopher Columbus," from a 
script by French journalist Roselyne Bosch. It will "go beyond the history 
books" to tell "the truth about the man and what happened," says a Scott 
spokeswoman. The film's star -- and start date -- will be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
What about the Salkinds' claim to ties with the Spanish government? 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some of the same conversations (with Spanish officials) and they're 
supportive," says the Scott spokeswoman. "1992 is a big year for Spain. They 
won't care if there are 10 films about Christopher Columbus." Pat H. Broeske

<TEXT>     Q: Yes, it has, Mr. Columbus. You wouldn't recognize it.;    A: Well, I bet
they have a lot more Indians. Those people were everywhere.;    Q: We call
them Native Americans now, Mr. Columbus. And they are virtually nowhere. They
were mostly killed by the white men.;    A: What are you talking! What is this
American stuff? I was sailing to India.;    Q: No, Mr. Columbus, that was
America. We call this part of it the United States of America now.;    A: The
world has gone wacky. If it wasn't India, why didn't they call it
Columbusland? I discovered it.;    Q: Well, they named it after Amerigo
Vespucci. He was an Italian. They do have a city called Columbus in Ohio.;   
A: Vespucci. They named it after him? That Mafioso! And where is Ohio? Did I
discover it?;    Q: No, Mr. Columbus. It was discovered by early Native
Americans.;    A: Again with the Native Americans. I tell you, I can recognize
an Indian at 5,000 feet! Why did you change the name?;    Q: It was
politically correct.;    A: What? What kind of word is that? My New World
sounds all messed up.;    Q: Well, it has changed. A lot of people claim now
that you were no hero. That you were a tyrant who cut off the natives' hands.;
   A: So?;    Q: You admit it?;    A: I'm not sure. You sound sneaky. What
does Queen Isabella say?;    Q: She's dead.;    A: Good. She brought me home
in chains. You want to talk meanness, you should mention that. And she had
promised me a few nice acres for a home in Florida. I bet Florida has
changed.;    Q: It's very crowded. Very hard to find a few nice acres in
Florida. Did you have any special dreams for your New World?;    A: Of course.
I wanted to open a chain of Columbus Pizza Shops. They didn't know what pizza
was when I landed. The Indians would have loved it. You can't beat Italian
food.;    Q: There are lots of pizza shops in America.;    A: The West
Indies!;    Q: There, too.;    A: Well, I was a man ahead of my time. I could
have used the Pinta and the Santa Maria for cruises, you know, for tourists.
Could have charged 20, 30 lire a trip.;    Q: You could get thousands of
dollars now. And millions of lire.;    A: Ahead of my time. Tell me, did they
ever discover California?;    Q: You know about that?;    A: Of course. It was
my secret. I was going to build a huge amusement park there.;    Q: Amazing!
There is a huge amusement park there! Disneyland. And there's Disney World in
Florida!;    A: On my acres, I bet! Selling pizza all over the place! I was
badly treated. The New World is a rip-off joint!;    Q: Well, if it is, lots
of people think you started it. By your greed and cruelty.;    A: MY greed?
They don't call it Columbusland, do they? They don't call it Columbus World,
do they? What about this guy Disney?;    Q: He was a great pioneer!;    A:
Yeah. He had a better agent than my guy. Took my land and my pizza. Tell me,
do they celebrate my birthday in the Indies?;    Q: In America, yes, they do,
but there is considerable protest over that now.;    A: Why, for God's sake?; 
  Q: They say you really didn't discover anything. There were tens of
thousands of Native Americans already there when you got there.;    A: Yeah,
but we got there! On three stinking little ships. With all sorts of rotten
sailors. And we didn't fall off the end of the world, either. I told them they
wouldn't. And now they say I didn't discover the place. Boy. That America is a
rip-off.;    Q: Would you like to apologize?;    A: To whom?;    Q: To the
Indians -- the Native Americans!;    A: Listen, maybe we can work a deal. I
could get a few of those acres in Florida, and I would give them a couple of
trinkets. Or beads. Those people loved beads in the old days!;    Q: They have
wised up.;    A: How about six pesos for Manhattan Island?;    Q: Somebody
already worked that deal. And now 2 1/2 million people live on Manhattan
Island!;    A: Holy Isabella. That many! Those Indians are everywhere. Tell me
something.;    Q: Yes.;    A: Could I maybe open a couple of pizza huts on
that island?;    Q: Too late, Chris.;    A: Yeah. Rip-off. How about
Chrisburgers?  </TEXT>

SOUTHERN SPAIN JUMPING TOWARD 21ST CENTURY; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD'S FAIR: ANDALUSIA AND THE CITY OF SEVILLE ARE UNDERGOING THE GREATEST 
FACE LIFT IN THEIR HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SEVILLE, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four bridges span the indolent Guadalquivir River here today, legacy of 20 
centuries of settlement that began in Roman times. Over the next three years, 
seven new bridges will be built across the muddy river that is Seville's 
trademark and its lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
Storied Seville, one giant detour now, is in the throes of the greatest face 
lift in its history. Dazzling modernization for the regional capital is the 
cornerstone of a regional development scheme that will yank flamenco-and-sherry 
Andalusia pell-mell into the 21st Century. Amid great expectation, and some 
disquiet, the era of the superlative has come to laggard southern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst is a 1992 world's fair, Expo '92, that will be this century's last 
and, yes, history's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government, with a big financial assist from the European 
Community, is investing $7 billion to bring the rickety Andalusian 
infrastructure up to continental standards. A self-financing state corporation 
will spend $800 million to prepare the exhibition site on 538-acre La Cartuja 
Island in the middle of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of millions more will come from 170 exhibitors at Expo itself -- 101 
countries have signed up so far -- and from off-site private investors hoping 
to cash in with everything from souvenir shops to luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Roads, a high-speed railroad, expanded regional airports, a refurbished port, 
and high-tech telecommunications are all wending their way from drawing boards 
to the streets and countryside of Spain's most populous region. 
</P>
<P>
In the Spanish matrix, Andalusia, with 17% of the national population but only 
12% of national income, is renowned more for graceful languor than dynamism. 
What is being called Europe's most ambitious project of the '90s is expected to 
generate 200,000 jobs for a region whose unemployment is higher than in the 
rest of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its early earthmoving, pipe-laying stages, regional development is 
having great impact: Spain will grow economically 5% this year; Andalusia 6.8%. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Expo's 176-night run ends on the 500th anniversary of Christopher 
Columbus' arrival in the New World, Oct. 12, 1992, it will have reached into 
the lives of all 6.8 million Andalusians.

Seville, now wed mostly to tourism, will get its first ring road, and be linked 
to the rest of Spain by multi-lane expressways for the first time. A bullet 
train will halve travel time from Madrid to three hours, and passengers will 
detrain at a spanking new Seville terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Regional airports at Seville, Malaga and Jerez will lose their provincial air. 
The phones will work. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the promises of officials at the autonomous regional Andalusian 
government who are overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We are providing investment that Andalusia needs in an accelerated form. 
Necessary improvements that might be scheduled over 15 or 20 years will instead 
be accomplished in three," said Jaime Montaner, public works minister for the 
regional government who is overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
The overall project is enormous, though, and amid traffic-jammed, 
construction-everywhere inconvenience, nerves are already jangling. 
</P>
<P>
"Seville is uncomfortable, but everybody in Seville wants Expo. We all 
understand that it is worth suffering now for the benefits that will come 
later," Montaner said. 
</P>
<P>
With the fair pledged to open Easter Monday, April 20, 1992, construction 
deadlines are inelastic. A road finished months late may benefit Andalusia as 
much in the long run but in the interim may imperil Expo's success and 
embarrass Spain with the whole world watching. 
</P>
<P>
Spain will mark Columbus' anniversary as its own coming of age in a uniting 
Europe. In addition to Expo, it will sponsor the 1992 Summer Olympics in 
Barcelona, a European Cultural Year in Madrid, and a major exhibit in Toledo 
celebrating Spain's Jewish and Muslim heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Planners expect that 18 million visitors will come to Seville's Expo, and pay 
an average daily admission price of about $20 to see a fair conceived as a 
cross between a Disney extravaganza and a classical exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Montaner promises that Andalusia will not disappoint them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cause for alarm. On the contrary, things are moving well. 
Everything is on schedule. It's a great challenge, but we'll be ready," he told 
a visitor to his office in the cobblestones-and-tourists old quarter of a city 
that became one of the richest in the world when it enjoyed a 16th-Century 
monopoly of trade with what is now Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the bulldozers and tumbled red earth on the Expo island, Jacinto Pellon, 
the bearded engineer and weekend sailor who is chief executive of the Seville 
Universal Exposition 1992, is equally upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"On site, we are on time. We are pushing the exhibitors to begin their own 
construction next spring," he said, describing his project as "something like 
Epcot, but a bit more serious, and with a lot of entertainment; rock to ballet 
to symphonic music to experimental theater." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Information Agency will sponsor the $20-million American pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus is the star of what is technically a Universal Exposition in the 
tradition of the only other three of the breed since World War II: Brussels 
'58, Montreal '67, and Osaka '70. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the 15th-Century Carthusian monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas on 
La Cartuja Island that Columbus planned his journey. He lived behind the thick 
monastery walls between trips and was buried there for a time. 
</P>
<P>
The monastery itself, later converted to a ceramics factory that operated until 
1982, is being restored, nave to frescoes, as the symbol of an exhibition that 
will also feature the replica of the 15th-Century port of Seville whence the 
Admiral of the Ocean Sea ventured west with the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa 
Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Exposition chief Pellon says Expo will draw on past international extravaganzas 
such as the Osaka fair and the Los Angeles Olympics, but with an important 
difference. After Expo ends, the island and many of its structures will become 
a center for university instruction and corporate research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the lasting benefits will be construction of the the first 
full-blown opera house for a city to which opera is no stranger: "Barber of 
Seville" to "Carmen" to "Fidelio" and "Don Giovanni."

<HEADLINE>  NEW THEORY ON COLUMBUS' NATIONALITY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HE WAS NORWEGIAN,
HISTORIAN SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Tor Busch Sannes does not claim to have definitive proof. Instead, he cites
a series of coincidences, historical fact and imaginative interpretation he
hopes historians will investigate further.;    His book, "Christopher Columbus
-- A European from Norway?" suggests that Columbus was a Norwegian nobleman
named Christopher Bonde who discovered America in 1477, not in 1492.;   
Columbus actually undertook a voyage north of Iceland in 1477, according to
the World Book Encyclopedia. Sannes argues that voyage could have reached
Canada or New England 15 years before Columbus laid anchor in the West Indies
in 1492.;    Late celebration;    "America is getting ready to celebrate the
500th anniversary (of Columbus' discovery) 15 years too late," Sannes said.;  
 The book has generated considerable news coverage, skepticism and amusement
in Norway. Some see it as belated revenge for overlooking the Viking seafarer
Ericson's discovery of North America nearly 500 years earlier.;    Many
Norwegians believe Ericson was one of their countrymen. But historians believe
he was actually born in Iceland of a Norwegian father.;    Knut Utstein
Kloster, the millionaire shipowner who funded Sannes' work, said he didn't
know whether Columbus was a Norwegian, and neither did Sannes. "But this is an
exciting story that should inspire researchers and others to carry on work
with the theory," he said.;    Historical possibilities;    "Circumstantial
evidence cannot be considered definitive proof," Sannes agreed. "But I hope
that the possibility will be seriously researched by historians.";    History
books generally say Columbus was born in 1451, the son of an impoverished
weaver from Genoa, Italy, named Domenico and his wife, Suzanna.;    Historians
dispute the details of the explorer's clouded childhood. Several countries --
including Spain, Portugal and Italy -- claim him as a native son. Sannes said
the historical evidence just as easily could lead to a conclusion that
Columbus was born in Norway.;    "The most convincing evidence was Columbus'
coat of arms," Sannes said. In the position designating a father's lineage, it
bears an emblem identical to that used by the Bonde family, he said.;    The
noble Bondes;    Sannes said Columbus' father could have been a member of the
noble Bonde family who he believes fled to Italy in the 1400s to avoid
persecution in Norway.;    Sannes cited other bits of evidence: Columbus never
wrote in Italian, he called himself a foreigner in southern Europe and he was
described in some biographies as tall, fair and blue-eyed -- typical Nordic
characteristics.;    The book suggests that Columbus was invited to join the
1477 Iceland expedition because he learned to sail in Nordic waters as a
Norwegian youngster in Nordfjord, on Norway's midwestern coast.;   
Nordfjord's mayor, Nils R. Sandal, is skeptical of such theories. "I think
we'll drag our feet for a while before raising any Columbus monuments in
Nordfjord," he said, adding jokingly that town residents should search their
attics for any Norwegian-language letters written by Columbus.  </TEXT>

FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (7): The renaissance
filled his sails - The Europe in which Columbus launched his great adventure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NO-ONE should belittle Spain's determination to make the world recognise
1992 as a turning point in its modern history.
The Spanish regard their homeland as Western Europe's last frontier. Five
hundred years ago it still remained undecided whether their portion of the
Iberian Peninsula formed the northernmost outpost of Africa or the
south-western extremity of Christendom. Spain was located on the wrong side
of the Pyrenees.
More, it had been occupied by the Moslems too long, in parts for almost 800
years. And who ruled Spain? Kings or cardinals or robber knights or the
Hermandad, the powerful organisation of 'brotherhoods' that originated as a
militia policing the regions and doubled as a national tax-collecting
agency? But times were ready for change when IsabelIa of Castile married
Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469, against strong popular feeling in both states
and while neither was as yet a crowned head. The financing of Ferdinand's
suit, quite beyond the capacity of his bankrupt father King John of Aragon,
was provided by Jewish financiers in the royal employ, acting in collusion
with a Catalan official of the Vatican, the future Borgia Pope Alexander VI.
IsabelIa was 18, Ferdinand a year younger. Unlike Portugal, which prospered
by espousing the Atlantic as a second province, Spain was an unmade bed.
Much of Andalucia in the south still remained Moslem territory. The
Reconquista, called a crusade, was not yet completed in 1491. Concentration
on the mission had created an inward-looking Spanish people of passionate
intensity.
This was accompanied by intermarriage on a scale to make it difficult to
discern whether an individual was of Christian or Hebrew or Arab descent.
A mountainous land dry as dust bred a dogged population attached to their
patch. This national introspection goes some way to account for the ferocity
of the Civil War in the 20th century which cost three quarters of a million
lives, and the fact that Spain kept out of this century's two great European
conflagrations.
The voyage of Christopher Columbus as a Spanish enterprise owed nothing to
the young monarchs' empire-building desires. They had no such ambition. The
man from Genoa had peddled his proposition to a succession of rulers, but
without success. He first appealed to King John of Portugal, only to be
rebuffed. Columbus next approached Isabella and Ferdinand, again being
refused. Then, in desperation, he besought the brilliant Regent of France,
Anne of Beaujeu; and finally Henry VII of England.
None was interested. They exhausted their wealth in battles over ownership
of a town, or a river, or a forest within Europe. But they were deaf to the
concept of a second shore to the Atlantic where, according to Columbus,
realms beyond dreams were available for the taking.
He returned to Spain, waiting impatiently outside the royal headquarters
during the protracted campaign against Granada. Years passed before the
Queen's advisers, notably the baptised Jew Luis de Santangel, persuaded her
to grant Columbus her patronage. What had she to lose, they urged, with a
negligible gamble of three tiny caravels? They had just hoisted the royal
standard, together with a huge silver cross given by the Pope, on the
Alhambra, the defeated Moorish kingdom's architectural masterpiece.
Because Columbus stole the historic moment for his perilous adventure into
the unknown, the immense strategic achievement in closing the Straits of
Gibraltar against exit by Ottoman fleets remained for a time unremarked. It
was as crucial to the future of the European races as the annexation of
America. The Catholic monarchs had thereby locked the Sultan of Turkey
within the Mediterranean.
Had the Sublime Porte been able to pass its ships into the Atlantic it could
well have encircled this continent. Turkey was already master of the greater
portion of south-eastern Europe. Western countries lay unprotected on their
oceanic side, the Portuguese being too few to engage a major enemy. France
was preoccupied with internal consolidation and in eternal dispute with
others over the Low Countries, while England had not yet recovered from the
wounds of the Hundred Years War or the Wars of the Roses.
To be sure, Turkey may not have succeeded in replacing Christianity with
Islam in Europe, but physical control was all the Crescent aspired to, as in
the Balkans. Ventures deep into the Atlantic would then have been automatic,
with the New World doubtless given another conqueror and a different
history. Moslem mariners were no less skilled than the European, as witness
their navigation of the Indian Ocean as far as the Malabar coast. Portuguese
ships hugged the western shores of Africa but had not as yet properly
rounded the Cape.
Amazingly, Europe itself, when Columbus planted Isabella's banner on the
Arawak island he baptised San Salvador on October 12, 1492, counted no more
than as a mere promontory hanging precariously over the ledge of Asia.
Europe comprised a jigsaw of statelets torn by perennial strife.
Eastwards, Europe was ever dangerously exposed to a resolute predator.
Following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 there seemed no stopping
the Turk. He would reach the outskirts of Vienna in 1519, to hold the
Austrian capital in siege for a further century and a half. He had swallowed
Hungary and threatened Poland, while Muscovy had only recently shaken off
Tatar tutelage.
Only in 1571 did Spain, now the greatest European power, manage to clip the
Sultan's sails at Lepanto in Greek waters, where Cervantes lost an arm. The
long retreat and decline of the Ottomans on land had not yet begun.
Returning to the annus mirabilis of 1492, we find the young Ferdinand mostly
apathetic to Columbus and the consequences of a new continent joined to
Spain. Ownership of the colonies came specifically to Isabella's Castile.
Ferdinand was busy scheming his way into the possession of the southern half
of Italy. A minor princeling on his marriage, he founded a dynasty destined
for the ultimate tiara available to a European monarch - the crown of the
Holy Roman Empire. Of the offspring from his union with Isabella two girls
survived - the demented Joanna and the unhappy Katharine, first wife of
Henry VIII.
Joanna proved the vessel in which the great design was consummated. Her
marriage to a Habsburg produced Charles V, the king-emperor reigning over
half of Europe and extensive dominions across the world. The last of his
line, Dr. Otto von Habsburg, has renounced all claims to a throne and today
sits in the European parliament as a representative of Bavaria.
So is this the picture to set the scene for the Quincentenary? Crowns lost,
empires rising and declining, a theatre of global proportions with entire
populations observing the spectacle? Hardly. The year 1492 heralded the
Europeans' domination of the rest not only by the prerogative of conquest
but also through the sinews of trade and the spirit of the Renaissance.
Commerce reached global dimensions with the overseas acquisitions of the two
Iberian powers east and west. The world's abundance funnelled into Lisbon
and Seville, eclipsing Venice in the process. Lombard and Flemish bankers
lubricated the system and promoted Antwerp to Europe's premier metropolis.
Capitalism came into its own.
Peruvian silver soon flooded into Europe to create new money markets and
destabilise currencies. Within 100 years both Portugal and Spain faltered,
losing their capability to sustain their distant possessions. The field
cleared for successor empires, English, French and Dutch.
Simultaneously, Europeans began exploring new frontiers of the mind. The
Renaissance might be described as a rediscovery by man of his own emotional
creativity. Out of Italy, impotent plaything of Franco-Spanish rivalries,
the shoots grew into a dazzling cultural and intellectual harvest. This
began in Tuscany, more exactly Medicean Florence, then spread throughout
western Europe.
European philosophers, artists and theologians dared to challenge a doctrine
that pronounced every human endeavour to be directed by God's will, unless
foiled by the Anti-Christ. Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516, was
inspired by news of a virgin civilisation across the Atlantic to advance the
idea of a state based on social justice, tolerance of all religions.
The work exerted a profound influence on some clerics, among them Bartolome
de Las Casas, a friar domiciled in Mexico, who had the ear of the Emperor
Charles V. In consequence of Las Casas' agitation against his
fellow-colonists for their inhuman treatment of their slaves, Charles
ordered stringent rules to protect the surviving Indian tribes - too late,
unhappily, to avoid a genocidal catastrophe.
Current attitudes induce a cynicism regarding the intentions of Columbus,
and Spain, in bringing European religion, with its social and cultural
mores, to corrupt the innocents of the new territories. We protest too much.
Three hundred years after the Discoverer sailed, and with the American War
of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man already
history, Britain began a colonisation of Australia. The result for the
aboriginal population there equalled that earlier epoch of expropriation
drenched with slaughter.

<LEADPARA>  SEAN Connery felt fettered and humiliated in Bond-age. Roger Moore, never a
serious actor to begin with, had a lark with James Bond, whom he played as a
clown in Savile Row tweeds. Timothy Dalton, perhaps the cleverest of the
bunch, is using good old 007 to get his pick of, well, more interesting
roles.;    Currently, Dalton, 47, is playing '30s matinee idol/Nazi spy
Neville Sinclair in Disney's "The Rocketeer." It's a deliciously cheeky turn,
part haughty Olivier, part seedy Errol Flynn (right down to the pencil-thin
mustache). Dalton says the role was tailored for him.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "When I first read the (comic book-inspired) script, I didn't want to play
the part. Sinclair was written in a very one-dimensional way. The guy was just
a pompous ass. Disney told me, 'We're going to rewrite the entire script, move
the character from being a cartoon to a much better role.' I wanted to exploit
the fact that he's an actor, to find moments when he seems to be one thing but
is really lying through his teeth. I wanted to show how phony actors can be. I
loved doing it.";    The spy who loved Mae;  Dalton says his favorite line
comes during the knockdown, drag-out with the hero aboard a German zeppelin.; 
  The line "I always do my own stunts" (in response to a Rocketeer put-down),
right?;    "No, it comes a little later. I based my whole performance on it.
It's when Sinclair says, with wonderful arrogance, 'It wasn't a lie, it was
acting.' What nonsense! Acting is lies, but it's also the truth. The whole of
his life this German agent is pretending.";    Little wonder Dalton could
identify with the character. In one manner or another the Welsh actor has been
"pretending" since his late teens, when he attended London's National Youth
Theater and Royal Academy. "Extreme good luck" led to a supporting role
opposite Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn in "The Lion in Winter" and roles
in "Mary, Queen of Scots," a "Wuthering Heights" remake (as Heathcliff, of
course) and "Agatha.";    A different kind of luck led Dalton to Mae West's
"Sextette" and the worst of the comic-strip fantasies, "Flash Gordon" and
"Brenda Starr" (with Brooke Shields as the intrepid reporter).;    This fall
Dalton will don doublet and pantaloons and set sail as New World explorer
Christopher Columbus in Ilya and Alexander Salkind's $40 million "Christopher
Columbus: The Discovery." Then, he'll renew his license to kill for his third
Bond outing, a still-untitled cliffhanger that will attempt a comfortable
middle ground between the farcical Moore Bonds and Dalton's darker "Licence to
Kill." "Licence" received high marks from Bond enthusiasts but brought in a
disappointing $40 million in domestic ticket sales.;    "We were the victim of
a not particularly good advertising campaign on 'Licence,' " Dalton says.
"Then, too, we opened whilst 'Batman,' 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' and 'Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade' were still going strong. We were like the sixth or
seventh big movie. It was a very bad time to open, but worldwide 'Licence' did
better than 'The Living Daylights' (Dalton's first Bond outing), which was the
biggest grossing Bond movie for 10 or 12 years.";    At the time, it was
reported that Dalton's license to kill was revoked because he was the least
popular of the Bonds. Dalton rankles at the memory.;    "No, that was never
discussed," he fairly hisses into the phone. "Stupid, irresponsible
journalism. . . . One telephone call to 'Cubby' Broccoli (the series'
producer) could have gotten the truth.";    The next Bond, referred to vaguely
at MGM as "Bond No. 17," is still on the drawing board. Dalton explains: "The
script isn't finished, but what I've seen is outrageous. It's a formative
script that obviously needs some work, but when it's finished it'll combine
the best of 'Daylights' and 'Licence,' with some good tough humor.";    It's
tricky attempting to pump a sense of jeopardy back into the series while
holding on to the vermouth-dry humor of the best Connery Bonds, "From Russia
With Love" and "Goldfinger," Dalton concedes.;    "We definitely have to have
more humor in the Bond movies, but I don't want it to be campy humor or a
sendup. I dearly love Roger Moore, but if you talk about the best Bonds,
you're talking about Sean Connery and not camp or sendup. In the '70s and
early '80s, the Bond pictures were dominated by gadgetry and technical
effects, which were often superb. I found them uninvolving. Connery's Bond was
a human being. Cynical and dry, mind you -- but a man with a man's sense of
humor and a certain world-weariness.";    0017;    Dalton explains that Bond
No. 17 was derailed when MGM/UA, the distributor of the series, was taken over
by Pathe and everything went into a legal limbo. "This time last year we were
supposed to go into production, but since the takeover nothing has happened.
There's great uncertainty at MGM now.";    Though contractually obligated to
play Bond, Dalton is his own actor between assignments. "I'm perfectly free to
do whatever I want," he says with a sniff.;    Connery, likewise, did other
films during his time out of Bond-age -- most notably "A Fine Madness" and,
for Hitchcock, "Marnie" -- but he complained bitterly over a PR campaign
designed to make his name synonymous with the Ian Fleming super spy. That was
before Superman, Batman and indeed Rocketeer came along to break Bond's
monopoly on cliffhanger suspense.;    "They did a big push to mold the public
impression of Bond -- of Connery as Bond," says Dalton. "The series was unique
back then. There weren't any movies like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' It was the
first of the big, high-rolling action-adventure films.";    The mood is
changing in Hollywood, Dalton believes. Spectacle for spectacle's sake is no
longer enough. Big-budget vehicles such as "Robin Hood" and "Hudson Hawk" are
already passe.;    What about his upcoming Columbus project, scripted by Mario
Puzo and due to get under way in September or October in Spain and the
Caribbean? That sounds like a classic Hollywood "costumer" of the type Olivier
and Flynn once made.;    Nothing could be further from the truth, Dalton
says.;    "We're not doing a historical, two-dimensional pageant. We're not
doing a school-book treatment. You won't be watching waves sloshing past
boats. This will not be a dry history lesson; it will be about the inner
struggle of the man. It will be done with passion and vision and be full of
details that nobody knows.";    That's the crowning irony, Dalton says. The
man who discovered the Americas is unknown in America.;    "You don't know
anything about him really. All you know is that he sailed across the Atlantic
and hit America. He was an extremely obsessive man with a great vision. He had
a great sense of ambition. He was very poor and wanted to get rich. He wasn't
Spanish, and he was probably part Jewish at a time when they were burning
Jews.";    If everything goes as planned -- and nothing goes as planned when
you're shooting at sea -- the Salkinds' "Columbus" will be in theaters in
October 1992, just in time to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
docking at what is now Watling Island in the Bahamas.;    Hot on its rudder
could be a Paramount Pictures version titled simply "Christopher Columbus."
This version is being described as an earthier, more psychological handling of
the Italian explorer who, in the summer of 1492, sailed for Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain.;    Paramount's "Columbus" is being hyped as a possible
Gerard Depardieu vehicle, with Ridley ("Thelma &amp; Louise") Scott set to direct.
In contrast to Dalton's Columbus, who sounds like a more traditional hero,
Depardieu's man from Genoa has been described as a manipulator and a martinet
who dies in poverty and disgrace.;    Dalton feels the Atlantic is only big
enough for one Columbus saga.;    "I've not read their script, but the
competition is not a good thing," he says. "They (Scott and Depardieu) are
good people. I wish them luck. But I would be lying if I told you that I feel
comfortable about this. It doesn't please me. It ain't going to be good to
have two Columbuses in theaters at the same time. But it only makes us more
ambitious to be the better one.";    If box-office history is a measure of
such things, they're well on their way to becoming a hit, reasons Dalton, who
takes a strong interest in the business side of things.;    "Of course past
grosses are no guarantee of quality or success," he agrees, "but in this case
they are in some sense good grounds for a movie. Puzo wrote the 'Godfather'
movies. The Salkinds did the 'Superman' movies. There are my two Bonds. George
Cosmatos (the director) did 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' and 'Cobra.' Among
us, we've made several of the top-grossing films of all time. That's cause for
optimism.";    Any trepidation about spending a good part of next fall on the
high sea?;    "I love water," he says. "And the boats are wonderful. The
Spanish government has built replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa
Maria as part of their 500-year celebration. They're letting us use them.
They're tiny, tiny boats. When they sail off, they're like little dots on the
sea." (box)  </TEXT>

<HL> International: Spain to Celebrate Columbus's Voyage At an $800 Million Coming-Out Party </HL>

<TEXT>
   Spain has begun restoring the Seville monastery where Christopher Columbus rested between sailings, and where he lay buried for a quarter century after he died, as part of an $800 million extravaganza to commemorate his discovery of America. 

   But Expo '92, as the project is called, will be more than just a celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to the New World. 
It will also be an international coming-out party for Spain's emergence as a modern democracy. 

   Falling nearly two decades after the death in 1975 of right-wing dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, 1992 is the final year before Spain's full integration into the European Community and also the year of the Barcelona Olympics. 
In addition, 1992 is the year the EC is supposed to dismantle all remaining trade barriers within its borders -- a major test for Spanish industry, which is modernizing but still shackled by a history of state paternalism and protectionism. 

   "It can reinforce the idea Spain is regaining a position within the Western community, that it isn't a Third World country but one that also has some cards to play," says Juan Diez Nicolas, a sociologist. 

   The exposition in Seville will run from April until Oct. 12 -- 500 years to the day from Columbus's landing on the Caribbean island of San Salvador. 
It is expected to attract 20 million visitors. 

   The budget of more than $800 million is to be covered by entry charges, the sale of television and souvenir rights, and sponsorship by commercial firms. 
Like the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Expo '92 is supposed to pay for itself. 

   There are doubters: Seville, a city of 700,000, is better known for flamenco dancing and music and bullfights than for science and high technology -- the themes of the exposition. 
How much public interest it will generate isn't evident, even to some Spaniards. 
"I really don't know whether the exhibition has a clear enough theme to arouse much enthusiasm," comments a Madrid businessman. 

   The former Carthusian monastery where Columbus often stayed and where he was buried from 1509 until his body was moved to Santo Domingo in 1536, will be the centerpiece of Expo '92. 
Converted into a ceramics factory in the early 19th century and vacant since 1982, it is being rebuilt as an architectural showcase. 
King Juan Carlos, hailed in Spain as a national savior for thwarting an attempted military coup in 1981, will spend much of his time there welcoming foreign leaders. 

   More than 70 nations, including all of Latin America, the U.S., the Soviet Union, China, Japan and most European nations, have already said they will take part in Expo '92. 
Manuel Olivencia, a law professor who is the exposition's government-appointed director, wants to beat the record set in Osaka, when 77 nations took part. 

   In the buildup to 1992, about 500 billion pesetas ($4.2 billion) is being spent on such major public-works projects as a high-speed train link with Madrid, highways and improved airport facilities. 
Some 200,000 jobs are expected to be created, and in Seville real-estate prices have more than quintupled in the formerly depressed area along the Guadalquivir River overlooking the exhibition site. 

   Four Spanish banks have agreed to provide $67 million for rights to the Expo '92 logo and mascot. 
Multinational companies like Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan, Alcatel N.V. of France, Siemens AG of West Germany, N.V. Philips of the Netherlands and Xerox Corp. of the U.S. are paying $8.2 million to act as official sponsors. 

   In hopes of avoiding a debacle, planners have studied other world expositions, including the money-losing 1967 Montreal Expo, and some smaller international expositions such as those in Tsukuba, Japan in 1985 and in Vancouver in 1986. 

   Expo director Olivencia acknowledges the challenge he faces. 
Success or failure in Seville, he says, is likely to be crucial for similar projects planned by other nations between 1992 and 2001. 

   Vienna and Budapest have proposed a joint international exposition in 1995 to commemorate, among other things, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 40th anniversary of Austria's restored independence. 
In Hong Kong, businessmen have proposed an exposition in 1997, the year Britain is to hand back the colony to China. 
Hanover, West Germany, is bidding to hold a world's fair in 1998 or 2000, and there are rumors of other bids from Miami, Venice and Oslo. 

   After a period when many people thought the era of such extravaganzas was over, "there has been a resurgence of interest," says Marie-Helene Defrene, secretary-general of the International Expositions Bureau, an inter-governmental agency based in Paris.

<LEADPARA>  Christopher Columbus has discovered Cannes.;    Half a millennium after
bumbling onto the West Indies, the ancient mariner has landed on the shores of

Cannes Film Festival. Madonna, the first woman singer to explore herself on

<HEADLINE>  2 FILM MAKERS DISCOVER COLUMBUS, RACE TO
LAND INTERNATIONAL DEAL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     As usual with Chris, there is confusion. There are two of him here, or two
movies-in-the-making about him; "Christopher Columbus: The Discovery," with
George Cosmatos directing English actor Timothy Dalton, and "Christopher
Columbus," with Ridley Scott directing France's Gerard Depardieu.;    The
first film is to be released in the United States by Universal Pictures in
October 1992, timed to the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of
America; so is the second movie, whose North American rights were picked up
here Tuesday by Paramount.;    Just as the race between Warner Bros. and 20th
Century Fox to get Robin Hood movies out comes to an end, the two Columbuses
are setting sail, and both crews are skeptical.;    "I doubt if their movie
will ever be made," says Patrick Wachsberger, president of Odyssey Distributor
Ltd., the French company behind the Ridley Scott movie.;    "Their film
doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned," says Ilya Salkind, producer of the
Cosmatos version.;    The Columbus clash has suddenly become important because
both Salkind and Wachsberger are competing for the best deals in the
international markets. Salkind has brought in Dalton, writer Mario Puzo and
representatives of the Spanish government.;    Salkind, who with his father
Alexander Salkind co-produced the first three "Superman" movies, originally
had a deal with Scott to make their picture, but they split up, Salkind said,
when Ridley Scott insisted that the movie be based on the life of Columbus.
The Salkinds wanted to make a movie about the journey that led Columbus to his
chance discovery.;    Salkind's picture will start in Spain, follow Columbus'
first journey and end with his triumphant return.;    Bosch's story, covering
23 years, is told from the point of view of an illegitimate son who sets out
in 1510 to restore a forgotten Columbus to his former glory.;    Wachsberger
says his film will give a complete picture of a man who hustled his
opportunities, lied to his men, fought off mutineers and cannibals, reveled in
his celebrity and faded into obscurity before his death. This version will
begin in Spain, follow Columbus on all three of his voyages West, and end at
his deathbed.;    "It will be very factual," Wachsberger says, quickly adding
that Columbus will ultimately be perceived as a hero. "Nobody goes to a movie
to see anything but a hero," he says.;    The Puzo story, too, is accurate,
insists Salkind. "Spanish historians have been following the development of
the script," he says. "They want it to be accurate." Neither Salkind nor
Wachsberger would say that there will be enough quincentennial fever to
support both movies when they are released and both seem to be hoping the
other's ship will sink before production starts up.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  OCT. 12 MARKS a day 499 years ago that a lookout on a ship called the Pinta
shouted "Tierra! Tierra!" (meaning "Land! Land!"), and the "folly" of an
obscure Italian sailor named Christopher Columbus turned into one of the most
important events in the history of our world.;   Columbus had not discovered a
westward route to the Orient (as he had believed, and continued to believe for
the rest of his life). He had, in fact, come upon one of the Bahama Islands,
and he wouldn't visit anything but islands in the New World for another six
years, never reaching any land farther north than he did on that very first
day.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Still, his achievements were so great that Columbus became a hero in the
history of our civilization, and as such he is today the object of much scorn
and ridicule from "revisionist" writers and teachers who believe that children
and adults are better served by learning about every fault and blemish of the
people they have come to admire.;   By this time next year, we all will have
been "enlightened" by numerous revelations about Columbus' brutal treatment
and enslavement of the Arawak Indians he encountered during his four voyages.
I am certainly not suggesting that we shield our children from these facts of
history or that we tell them only the myths and not the truths about
historical heroes like Columbus or George Washington or Martin Luther King.;  
 WHAT I am suggesting is that there are reasons behind the elevation of men
and women to hero status, reasons that both transcend the myths and give rise
to them. All human beings are going to have human faults and failings, but not
all human beings have the ennobling qualities, the uncommon characteristics,
that allow heroes to perform heroic acts.;   "Family Learning," unlike
classroom learning or textbook learning, allows us to focus on these heroic
characteristics because the goal of what I call "family learning" is
self-improvement. We want to use the lessons that exist everywhere in the
world around us as ways to help ourselves become better, more knowledgeable,
wiser people, and to encourage our children to adopt this inexhaustible
self-perpetuating lifestyle of learning as well.;   So, what can we learn from
Columbus that will help us and our children to become better people? Well, we
can see that among his heroic qualities was the ability to dream great things
for himself, and then to back up his dreams with hard work and diligent
preparation. (As Thoreau said, "If you have built castles in the air, your
work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations
under them.");   COLUMBUS was also a man of extraordinary persistence, who
would occasionally get discouraged, but who would never give up. And he was a
lifelong learner as well, a man who had taught himself four languages,
navigation and meteorology, and who read everything he could find that would
be of benefit when his opportunity finally came.;   We can find other lessons
in the lives of the famous and the infamous throughout history, but first we
must begin to think of history not merely as a collection of facts for
memorization, but as a collection of experiences that have been handed to us
for our own personal benefit and development.  </TEXT>

   A financially troubled presidential commission
planning the 500th anniversary celebration of Columbus' 1492 voyage
to America faces a congressional investigation and a search for a
new chairman.
   John Goudie of Miami resigned Monday as head of the Christopher
Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission out of what his deputy
said was a sense of frustration.
   Goudie was a fund-raiser for the unsuccessful re-election effort
of Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who is President Bush's nominee as
director of national drug control policy. He was appointed to the
commission by former President Reagan.
   The commission is $600,000 in arrears on an agreement to pay
Spain for replicas of Columbus' three ships. The ships are to tour
American ports for the celebration.
   Texaco Inc., which has pledged $5 million, stopped its donations
in September because of ``some technical matters and overall
management of the program,'' Texaco spokesman K. Peter Maneri said
Tuesday. He said the company hopes the problems, which he refused
to detail, can be worked out and financial support resumed.
   Another potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp., says it wants to
clear up unspecified contractual questions before making a donation
of more than $1 million.
   A House Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee, meanwhile,
is delving into Goudie's longtime friendship with Manuel Gonzalez,
a Miami businessmen who has been involved in plans for the
celebration.
   A businessman, Peter Dunev of Miami, paid $50,000 for the right
to place the 500th anniversary logo on T-shirts. Gonzalez came by
Dunev's office last summer to pick up the checks for the $50,000,
Dunev said in an interview.
   The checks were made out to Christopher Columbus Licensing Group
Inc. of Miami and New York. The commission has awarded the
licensing group a contract enabling it to keep 85 percent of
commission-related sales on T-shirts and souvenirs.
   Bill Rolen, a Knoxville, Tenn., businessman who had made a
proposal for the celebration, said Goudie introduced him to
Gonzalez as a friend who might be able to provide Rolen with
financing
   Rolen said the two didn't do business because Gonzalez wanted
part ownership in Rolen's proposed venture. It was to have been a
renovation of a former world's fair exposition hall in Knoxville
for the Columbus celebration.
   Gonzalez did not return telephone calls to his home and office
in Miami. Goudie also couldn't be reached.
   However, the commission's deputy director, Jana Joustra, said
Goudie's resignation from the non-salaried, part-time post was
``completely voluntary.'' She said Goudie ``got fed up'' with the
problems, the lack of financial support and the criticism he faced
after spending a great deal of his own time on the project.
   ``Nobody appreciated it,'' she said.
   Congress appropriates $212,000 a year for the commission to pay
part of the salaries and rent for the six-member staff.
   The congressional subcommittee's investigation of the commission
will continue, said the panel's chairman, Rep. Thomas Sawyer,
D-Ohio.

A presidential commission planning the 500th anniversary celebration of 
Columbus' voyage to America has been plagued by problems: a tiny budget, few 
corporate donations and, until this month, almost no publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Now add a conflict-of-interest controversy to its list of woes. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's chairman, Miami real estate developer John Goudie, resigned amid 
disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company doing business with the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The event's biggest corporate sponsor, Texaco Inc., suspended its donations in 
September after raising questions about the commission's management. Another 
potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp., may stay away from the event. 
</P>
<P>
And a congressional subcommittee is looking into Goudie's involvement with the 
Christopher Columbus Licensing Group Inc., or CCLG, of Miami and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"To have this project blow up in our faces now is making it difficult to deal 
with future sponsors," said Frederick Guardabassi, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 
businessman who has served on the commission since 1985. "So much damage has 
been done to the commission. It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of Columbus' three ships being 
built in Spain and originally financed with money from Texaco. The commission 
is $600,000 in arrears in payments for the ships, which are to follow Columbus' 
route and visit 50 U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual questions before 
making a donation of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has appropriated $210,000 a year for the commission, which pays for 
staff salaries and office space. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped for cash, the commission turned to CCLG in 1989 because the company 
was willing to pay $300,000 immediately for the licensing rights to Columbus 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
The rights potentially are worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
Goudie is a popular fund-raiser for Republican candidates in Florida. His 
Hispanic background made him a natural for the commission chairmanship, say GOP 
figures in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
This year, CCLG paid at least $35,000 to Manuel Gonzalez, who describes Goudie 
as a close friend. The two Miami businessmen have known each other since their 
days in junior college, Gonzalez said during the course of several interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners said they didn't know about Gonzalez' role. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned," said Commissioner Charles Ginoli, who served on the finance 
committee that reviewed the CCLG contract.

<LEADPARA>  Canadian Indians set off in a protest ship Wednesday to intercept a flotilla
re-enacting Columbus' first voyage from Spain to the Americas. The Indians
said they were not seeking a confrontation with the flotilla, which includes
replicas of the three caravels Columbus sailed, but would try to block its
advance if the flotilla did not stop.;   "What we want is a peaceful and
friendly dialogue," Wii Seeks, a Gitksan tribal chief who leads the protest
mission, told reporters. He said they sought an apology from Spain, which is
sponsoring the commemorative voyage, and other nations for celebrating
Columbus' arrival in the New World. The Indians are aboard the Sea Shepherd 2,
owned and operated by a California-based environmental group, the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society.  </LEADPARA>

<LEADPARA>  I ENJOYED the July 7 Travel section very much, especially the articles about
the Columbus voyage of discovery.;    However, I must advise you that the
account of the voyages by Friar Bartolome de las Casas has long since been
discredited as a propaganda effort to undermine Columbus' claims against the
crown of Spain.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The writings of de las Casas properly belong with that genre of literature
which also includes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other notable
works written with political or economic motives to discredit one or another
person or group.;    Frankly, I am shocked that works by Hans Koning and
Kirkpatrick Sale would be treated as solid bases for analysis or reporting. I
am sure that both have one or another hidden agenda, and one that serves to
demean Latino Americans, and to rip away from Latinos and Latinas their
respect for their ancestors.;    I hope you will be able to do a balanced
piece that reports on the ways that old-fashioned slander in the 1400s and
1500s influences our views today.; Dale Warner; Secretary,; European American
Study Group; San Jose;  HISTORY LESSONS;  I WOULD like to commend Nora
Villagran on her story ("It's 'not my party': Storm brews over '92
celebration") in the July 7 Travel section. As a professor of social science
at San Jose State University, I recognize the importance of providing a
history that is accurate and unbiased.;    Unfortunately the curricula and
textbooks in our schools distort the facts of history to the extent that the
citizens of the United States will unknowingly celebrate not the "discovery"
of a new land, but rather the inception of one of the most brutal cases of
mass genocide ever committed against humankind.;    Educational historians
have shown that Benjamin Rush and Daniel Webster, two of the "fathers" of our
educational system, made a conscious decision to delete facts that may not
have contributed to the development of a patriotic citizenry during their
"Americanization," or rather, homogenization movement.;    Our schools
continue in the original tradition, feeding students one version of history,
resulting in linear-thinking, non-critical, non-analytical college adults. I
deal with them every semester in the classroom. I will use Villagran's
insightful and well-researched article in my classes.; Maria Luisa Alaniz; San
Jose;  Look to the future; AS THE quincentennial of the famous Columbus voyage
of 1492 draws near, there are some who claim this is no reason to celebrate.
Nora Villagran is quick to point out negative aspects of the Spanish arrival
in the Americas (July 7 Travel section).;    But as the Villagran article
progresses and various historians are quoted, the scope of the argument
broadens, addressing the entire issue of the European "conquest" of the
Americas. Most of the historians cited paint a picture of innocent indigenous
peoples exploited by evil colonizing Europeans.;    But is this assessment
fair in the light of historical perspective?;    I would like to cite the
legacy of the Aztecs in Mexico. Historians agree that the Aztecs' empire grew
by subjugating their less powerful neighbors and compelling them to pay
tribute. They took prisoners of war and subjected them to unthinkable torture.
They also participated in ritual cannibalism.;    Yet in Mexico and in many
parts of the United States, the Aztecs are generally held in high regard by
Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who look to their ancestors for cultural
identity.;    For example, Aztec ritual dances are regularly performed at
celebrations, and the calendar of the Aztecs is proudly displayed in homes and
offices. How is it that the atrocities of these indigenous people (Aztecs) are
overlooked and their accomplishments are admired, often by the very same
individuals who are clamoring to lay a heavy guilt trip on those who choose to
commemorate the voyage of Columbus?;    The significance of Columbus' voyage
was that it marked the beginning of the most profound change ever to occur in
the history of the people of the Western hemisphere. This change continues in
our day. La Raza, the new race created by the blending of Indian and Caucasian
blood, makes up the majority of the population in Mexico, Central and South
America. In the United States this group is the fastest growing minority. Can
we deny this blending of cultures is anything less than destiny? In Mexico and
many other parts of Latin America, Oct. 12 is not called Columbus Day, but Dia
de la Raza, which more accurately addresses the significance of the famous
encounter.;    Columbus Day should provide an opportunity for us not to point
fingers, but to search for positive results of the cultural phenomena that
have occured in the Americas in past 500 years and to reflect on where we are
heading.; Mark Van Den Broeke; King City;  Don't slander Columbus;  IT IS
quite a flattering event when all the different ethnic groups claim
Christopher Columbus as their own son but in the same breath slander him. I
ask myself how can a person claiming to be rational make such an unintelligent
judgment?;    In my opinion, Christopher Columbus is the greatest sailor of
all centuries. The Italian/American community has brought the spotlight
rightfully on this great mariner.;    If diverse ethnic groups feel they must
protest (against Columbus) then let them pick another day and not infringe
upon the rights of others to exercise the constitutional rights to free
assembly and speech.;    If they must parade in feathers and shoot arrows and
place Hitler's statue alongside Christopher Columbus, are they not honoring
Adolph Hitler? I hope these diverse ethnics will come to their senses and
respect the Constitution -- perhaps they will discover that the greatest of
documents has permitted them to parade in feathers and shoot their arrows.;
Cesare S. Claudio;  Santa Clara;  A Karlsbad disagreement;   I WOULD like to
comment on just one absurd statement made in the July 14 Travel section.;    I
am fascinated by the historical discovery of Egon Donner that there were no
Czechs ever in Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia) before 1945. He must
have access to some yet-unpublished archives of Konrad Henlein or perhaps
someone higher up.;    To the lonely tourist with the interest in history I
suggest walking into any cemetery in a 30-mile perimeter and count the
headstones older than 1939, separately, those with Czech and German names.
Then draw your own conclusion.; Herman Aster,; San Jose  </TEXT>

FT  10 OCT 92 / Columbus - the flawed legacy: Five hundred years on, Stephen
Fidler assesses the impact of the famed explorer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE HUNDRED years after his fateful voyage to the new world changed the
shape of history, Christopher Columbus is still stirring things up. To some,
he is the daring and far-sighted navigator of legend who brought
civilisation and the Christian religion to a new world; to others, a greedy
and small-minded opportunist whose actions wreaked devastation on a
continent.
There is no agreement even on what he looked like. None of the thousands of
likenesses being produced for the coming week's celebrations of the 500th
anniversary of his first landfall in the Americas was produced in his
lifetime. Authorities cannot even agree about where he first set foot on
land.
The Columbus story is permeated by myth. The traditional image, as the
fearless explorer, was espoused by the north Americans who 100 years ago
celebrated the anniversary of his 'discovery.' At this time, the US thought
of itself unequivocally as a European society, and European self-confidence
was at its height.
From the other side, the view of Columbus as a greedy fortune-hunter often
is accompanied by the idea of pre-Columbian America as an idyllic state. In
fact, it was subject to periodic and violent upheavals, with cannibalism and
human sacrifice an important part of some societies.
The politically correct also condemn Columbus based on a set of values of
which he could not have known.
It is undeniable, however, that the term 'discovery' for Columbus's voyage
is loaded with Eurocentricity. The 57m people living in the Americas - this
is one serious estimate, but the numbers could have been much higher or
lower - were there long before Columbus tipped up. As one observer has
pointed out, it was rather like President Nixon's 'secret' bombing of
Cambodia: to a lot of Cambodians, it wasn't much of secret.
Authoritative accounts suggest Columbus was not a wonderful navigator. He
appears to have believed throughout his life that he had discovered a new
route to Asia, and his trip arose out of a miscalculation about how far it
was to Japan. It is hard to question his bravery, but his navigational feat
was modest. His second voyage in 1493 took a mere three weeks: he took the
prevailing east winds over and the westerlies back. Once you knew it was
there, it was easy.
If Columbus had not sailed, the Indian 'idyll' would undoubtedly have been
destroyed by other Spanish adventurers soon after. The Spanish monarchy was
in a desperate search for capital: after centuries of fighting, the Arabs
were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in 1492.
During the same year, Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were
ordered out. Not surprisingly, they took their money with them. Although
Columbus had touted his idea to other royal courts, only at the Spanish was
he able to make an impact.
The impact of this was to be devastating: some estimates suggest the native
population of Latin America was reduced by 90 per cent within a century.
Although the indigenous people often were treated with horrific savagery by
the new settlers, most of them died through disease.
Their pathetic revenge: syphilis. Although it existed already in Europe, the
American strain was highly virulent. The returning adventurers brought it
back and the great pox swept the continent.
Columbus and his successors over the next 30 years paved the way for the
development for the first time of the 'global' economy. With the silver dug
out by hapless indians from the mines of Spain and Mexico, Europeans paid
for the spices and other goods which were being brought from Asia. Moreover,
tobacco, potatoes and other products from the new world were to change the
habits of the European people.
The interaction of the Spanish and the various Amerindian cultures differed
from region to region, the consequences of which can still be seen. The
urban cultures of the densest population - in Mexico, and of the Andean
societies - were easier for the conquerors to force into the colonial
economy. In Brazil, however (colonised by the Portuguese), and other
regions, the semi-nomadic natives could not be made to work. As a result,
large numbers of Africans were transported to the region as slaves.
The nature of medieval Spanish society was to make a permanent mark on Latin
America. It was also to permeate the north, becoming tied up with the myth
of the wild west. Spanish cattle farming techniques of the 12th century -
such as branding, lassoing and round-ups - were taken to the plains of South
America before they migrated north.
More fundamentally, the relationship between the Spanish ruling elites in
Latin America and the Spanish monarchy reflected that which existed between
the monarch and the Spanish baronies. This gave the colonial elites great
discretion to run their affairs, and to control indigenous populations, as
they pleased.
The rulers of the newly-independent Latin nations continued this tradition
in the 19th century, viewing the Indians as a threat to their emerging
nationhood. The consequences of all this can still be seen in the sharp
racial divisions in countries such as Peru, where the ruling elite still
largely considers itself European.
Another reason why Columbus manages to arouse such high emotions, five
centuries after his voyage, is that the issues raised by the European
colonisation of the Americas, and the subsequent transport of huge numbers
of Africans to work there, have yet to be resolved.
America's poor are overwhelmingly black or Indian, and the social injustices
of the European entry to the new world have not yet been addressed.
Following a decade which has seen a growing gap between rich and poor in
North America (because of the Reagan years) and in Latin America (because of
the debt crisis), this has hit a chord.
Columbus set in train a clash of three cultures: European, Amerindian and
African. The Indians and Africans did not voluntarily become adjuncts to the
European economy: they were forced to participate and, in its name, they
suffered agonies
The collision between the Indians and Europeans was inevitable. Historian
Edwin Williamson points out that the two groups had incompatible
expectations: Spain had a monetary economy in which gold was a scarce
resource and power was determined by control over labour.
The people of the Caribbean islands first encountered by Columbus lived in a
subsistence barter economy in which gold had an ornamental role and the idea
of labour service had not developed. The difference confirmed the European
prejudice, still to be heard in Latin capitals today, that Indians are
'lazy.'
The anniversary of Columbus appears, however, through media coverage, to
have raised consciousness in many parts of the world about the lot of the
American Indian. The prospect of celebrating the event, which many view with
horror, has made the Indians themselves more conscious of their own
identity, and encouraged some to use the mechanisms of Latin America's young
democracies to assert their rights.
Five hundred years after his voyage, Columbus might have performed a belated
service for Latin America's native cultures after all.

<HEAD>Report: Columbus Commission Under Financial Scrutiny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the presidential commission
organizing the 500th anniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to
America says he has submitted his resignation amid questions about
his and the panel's finances.
   John Goudie, a Miami Republican and real estate businessman, was
quoted as saying in The New York Times today that he sent a letter
to President Bush announcing his resignation from the unsalaried
post.
   Goudie, who was appointed by President Reagan in 1985, denied
any wrongdoing.
   ``It's time for me to bow out,'' he said, adding that the
commision needed ``some favorable publicity.''
   There was no immediate word on whether Goudie's resignation was
accepted. White House spokesman Sean Walsh had no comment on the
report.
   A House subcommittee has been looking at whether the Christopher
Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission has awarded contracts
properly. Some of the arrangements under scrutiny involve friends
of Goudie's, the Times said.
   The congressional panel plans to hold hearings next year into
the running of the commission after an audit by the General
Accounting Office, the newspaper said.
   The 5-year-old commission is $600,000 behind on an agreement
with Spain, which has built replicas of the three ships Columbus
led to the New World, because Texaco Inc., a main sponsor, has
stopped its donations, the newspaper said.
   Texaco and Goudie said the money was halted because of a
contractual dispute.
   Goudie said he is resigning because publicity over the Texaco
incident has jeopardized a pledge from the Chrysler Corp.
   One member of the commission, Virgil Dechant of Hamden, Conn.,
said he knew nothing of a resignation by Goudie. Dechant said that
to his knowledge, the commission had no particular financial
problems.
   Another member of the commission, Mary Jane Checci of
Washington, also said she knew nothing of a resignation.

"Rediscover the U.S.A." is the theme for the United States' pavilion at the 
1992 World's Fair in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The design for the $8-million pavilion features 50,000 square feet of 
exhibition space, gardens and a state-of-the-art theater. The pavilion is 
intended to be symbolic of Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic in 1492, and in 
keeping with the Expo '92 theme of "The Age of Discovery." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, three sun shades in the form of sails rise above the pavilion, 
an allusion to Columbus' ships, and a 40-foot high waterfall cascades down the 
entranceway into a moat representing the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles, the pavilion will be 
prefabricated in the United States and shipped to Seville for completeion by 
April, 1992. The focus of its exhibits will be trade and tourism, with every 
state and major city invited to participate.

<TEXT>
   From the storm that threatened Christopher
Columbus in 1494 to last year's powerful Gilbert, the death and
destruction wrought by hurricanes have been an intimate part of life
in America.
   ``Good God, what horror and destruction,'' wrote a 15-year-old
Alexander Hamilton after experiencing a hurricane in the West Indies
in 1772.
   ``The roaring of the sea and wind, fiery meteors flying about in
the air, the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning, the
crash of falling houses and the ear-piercing shrieks of the
distressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into angels,''
Hamilton reported in a letter to his father.
   ``Hurricanes have played an awsome role in the American panorama.
They have touched the lives of Americans great and small and, at
times, changed the course of our destiny _ as well as the shape of
our coastline,'' writes Patrick Hughes, managing editor of
Weatherwise magazine.
   The deadliest of these massive storms killed 6,000 people,
sweeping away much of Galveston, Texas, in 1900. And thousands have
perished in other storms over the years.
   Yet one hurricane may have prevented war between the United
States and Germany, another inspired Shakespeare's play, ``The
Tempest,'' and a third caused a young planter's daughter to leave
her Caribbean home for France, eventually to wed Napoleon and become
Empress Josephine.
   Columbus and his crew were probably the first Europeans to
encounter a hurricane, sailing through the fringes of one near
Hispaniola in 1494 and confronting another at full force near Santo
Domingo in 1502.
   A weather-wary seaman, Columbus recognized the signs of the
approaching tempest and took his ship into a protected cove to ride
out that second storm.
   Others refused to heed his warning and set forth for Spain.
Twenty ships and 500 men led by Adm. Frencisco de Bobadilla were
never seen again.
   In the next few years, both Ponce de Leon and Hermando Cortes
were shipwrecked in hurricanes, though both went on to become famous
explorers.
   In 1609, the English were seeking to settle the New World, and
one small fleet heading for Virginia was overwhelmed by a hurricane.
   While many ships limped into Jamestown, the ship Sea Adventure
was feared lost until 10 months later when its passengers and crew
arrived in a small boat they had built from the wreckage of their
ship.
   The Sea Advanture had been driven ashore on Bermuda, an island
unknown to sailors until that event. When the account of their
harrowing voyage and discovery was published in London in 1612 it
intrigued William Shakespeare, who was inspired to write the play,
``The Tempest.''
   It was August 13, 1766, when a hurricane swept over the tiny
Caribbean island of Martinique, wiping out the farms of wealthy
planter Joseph-Gaspard Tascher.
   With the family facing poverty, one of his daughters, Josephine
Marie Rose, returned to France where she met and married an
ambitious young army officer named Napoleon Bonaparte.
   A storm just six years later sent America one of its young
revolutionaries. Hamilton's letter to his father describing the 1772
storm so impressed local planters on the island of St. Croix that
they took up a collection and sent him to college in America.
   Weather historian David M. Ludlum speculates in his book ``The
Weather Factor'' that a hurricane may have prolonged the American
Revolution.
   British and French fleets were facing off near Rhode Island in
1778, with the French upwind and holding the advantage until a
hurricane arrived, damaging many ships and scattering the vessels.
   Had the French been able to engage and defeat the British, Ludlum
suggests, they might have achieved naval supremacy and thus hastened
the American vistory.
   Another hurricane thousands of miles away and just over a century
later may have prevented a war.
   The 1880s were a time when many nations were establishing
colonial empires, and Germany sought control over several islands in
the Pacific.
   In 1888, a German naval task force seeking to take control of
Samoa shelled a native village. Some American property was destroyed
and an American flag was torn down by German sailors.
   American warships rushed to the scene and naval vessels of the
two nations faced one another at Apia harbor on March 16, 1889.
   But before hostilities could begin, a savage hurricane
overwhelmed the area, and ships of both nations were wrecked or
driven aground. Sailors from both sides came to one another's aid in
the struggle to survive.
   Nearing the present, no hurricane can compare with the toll of
6,000 American lives lost when a hurricane driven surge of water
swept over Galveston Island in 1900. Another 1,000 likely died
elsewhere in that storm, though the exact toll may never be known.
   Gilbert, in 1988, was perhaps one of the stringest hurricanes of
this century, though it spent most of its fury in the islands and
Mexico, claiming only a few lives in Texas.
