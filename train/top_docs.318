Call it toothy gold, a get-rich quick plan for an area devastated by the crash 
of the oil market. 
</P>
<P>
Across Louisiana's marshes, once flush with profits from black gold, small 
patches of land increasingly are being turned into alligator farms, with 
investors hoping to quintuple their investments in short order. 
</P>
<P>
"Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raised gators sold" by 37 
farms, said Dave Taylor, alligator research coordinator for Louisiana's 
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. "That number is going to reach 60,000 
quickly and could be up to 100,000, certainly, within five years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
24,000 Trapped in Wilds 
</P>
<P>
That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped each fall in carefully 
supervised hunts. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by prices of $37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farms have opened in 
the last two years, and "We expect them to produce 18,000 gators," Taylor said. 
The waiting list for permits for new farms is about 100. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jones Jr., 28, went into business two years ago near Sweetlake and 
expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. His farm is state-of-the-art: 
automated cleaning, water-source heat pumps, carefully supervised diets. 
</P>
<P>
The result is quicker growth at less cost. "We have some (that) are 5 to 6 feet 
long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators that are 26 to 30 
inches." 
</P>
<P>
Skins of wild alligators average 7 feet in length, and are used for luggage. 
Farm-raised gators are skinned at 2 years old and about 4 feet long. Their 
hides are used for shoes, purses, belts and other smaller high-fashion 
accouterments requiring smaller patterns on the hides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Windowless Buildings 
</P>
<P>
For about $30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couple of windowless 
cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to raise 1,000 gators a 
year. It would take another $25,000 to $30,000 to operate until the gators grow 
enough to sell. At current prices, 1,000 4-foot hides would bring $148,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to 2 feet in 
length and 2 square feet up to 4 feet in length," Taylor said. Buildings must 
be able to hold a few inches of water and be kept about 89 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests, paying landowners 
for the eggs and committing 17% of the hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet 
long. That's a carefully researched percentage designed for zero growth in the 
population of 1.5 million wild alligators -- reached after the alligator was 
taken off the endangered species list in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The wild nests aren't easy to find, and female alligators guard their eggs -- 
about the only time in their lives that they show maternal instincts. 
</P>
<P>
No task for the timid, Taylor agreed. "But everybody's got to learn some time 
or another, if they want to get into farming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spot Nests From Air 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement, would be to hire 
someone with a little experience in locating nests from the air. That's the 
only way to go: Rent a helicopter and go find them and pick them up." 
</P>
<P>
The success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive prices down, and 
there are risks any time a market depends on fashion or something volatile, he 
said. "I don't think the bottom will fall out of the price. I don't think 
they'll go to $2 a foot. But it certainly could go to half of what it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welder who now devotes 
full time to his farm, agrees with Taylor's analysis. "A lot of these farms, 
you'll see what happens. Prices are good right now, but with all these hides 
coming on the market, it's going to have to go down." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones believes he will survive when others fail because his expenses are 
low. "Look at it this way, you've got an electricity bill of $500 a month to 
raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $150 a month to raise 12,000." 
</P>
<P>
His major problem is finding enough nutria -- small water rodents -- to feed 
the gators. Nutria, or coypus, often are dyed like beaver, Jones said.

140,000.''
   He had to supplement with fish and horse, and young alligators
don't grow as quickly on that diet. In addition, too much fish gives
alligators gout.

BILL GATES AND THE MAKING OF THE MICROSOFT EMPIRE by James Wallace and Jim
Erickson John Wiley, Dollars 22.95, 426 pages
WHEN THE screens and keyboards which clutter office desks are finally
replaced by proper visicom robots, men will marvel that such crude and
cumbersome machines could have ordered the business affairs of the late 20th
century.
Yet the revolution which produced today's personal computers was itself a
marvel of ingenuity and persistence. And among the heroes of that epic none
is odder, nor more spectacularly successful, than Bill Gates, the schoolboy
programmer, who became the billionaire chairman of Microsoft.
From his schooldays Gates was fascinated by the programming which makes
inanimate machines jump into life. In the early years this was a dreadfully
slow and painful task, both for the programmer and for the user: the machine
communicated in sullen and pedantic monosyllables.
Gates's and Microsoft's most recent success is founded on the vision that
personal computers should be bright, alive and responsive to the user,
should communicate in a simple standard way and should anticipate the user's
needs wherever possible. These ideas were first embodied in the operating
system of Apple computers, which present the user with a screen of small
drawings (or 'ikons') representing tasks he might want it to perform. By
using a remote controlled pointer, or 'mouse', the user can give
instructions without any need for typing.
Microsoft developed its rival Windows system for use on International
Business Machines personal computers and compatible makes. After a hesitant
start, Microsoft Windows is now sweeping the computing world, consolidating
Microsoft's dominance of the software industry and Gates's position as the
richest man in America, with a net worth of more than Dollars 8bn (Pounds
4.3bn).
Windows will no doubt come to be seen as an early form in the evolution of
intelligent desk-top machines to a point when they can understand the human
voice, can make suggestions and carry out many routine tasks unasked. Anyone
who thinks such ideas seem far fetched should read Wallace and Erickson's
account of the extraordinary progress made during the 36 years of Gates's
life and love for the soul of the machine.
It started when Gates was a bright, curious and highly competitive schoolboy
at Lakeside school, Seattle, playing games on a cumbersome terminal
connected to a computer owned by a local company called Computer Center
Corporation. Before long the 13-year-old Gates and his fellow pupils were
exploiting so many loopholes and faults in the machine that they were
invited by the company to go in after school to test the operating system to
destruction - while keeping a careful log. Gates then developed his lifelong
habit of working far into the night, but he did well in school also.
Gates even founded his first company, Traf-O-Data, at Lakeside, offering
analysis of urban traffic flows to local authorities. It might have
prospered, had not the Federal Government undercut him.
It was at Harvard, however, that Gates made his first serious business
venture with a fellow computer enthusiast, Paul Allen. They read that a
small company in New Mexico was to produce the first hobby computer in kit
form, the 'Altair', for the then amazingly low price of Dollars 397. No
matter that it lacked keyboard, screen, adequate memory, or programmes to
make it work, hobbyists were queueing to buy. Gates and Allen worked
feverishly at the Harvard computer to produce a version of the BASIC
programming language that would run on a machine of such meagre capacity. It
was a formidable task, since the computer understands only the simplest
instructions to open or shut switches. Gates and Allen completed the job,
formed a company called Microsoft and struck a deal with the maker of the
Altair.
In those early years, Gates displayed all the qualities of obsessive hard
work, vision, salesmanship, arrogance and temper tantrums which were so
important in 1980 when International Business Machines asked Microsoft to
develop a BASIC for the personal computer it was planning. Microsoft was
also to develop an operating system for the first IBM PC. This is the
central nervous system of a computer which silently organises the memory,
disk storage, and other 'bodily functions'. Devising an operating system is
a huge task which depends on excruciating detail, a combination suited to
Gates's genius. Even so, his new Disk Operating System was derivative, and
Gates struck a very tough bargain with Seattle Computer for the rights to
MS-DOS, the system which was eventually used on millions of machines
throughout the world.
This was an epic success, which broke some men and came close to destroying
the company, but it led to greater things, the development of Windows, and
Microsoft's leading wordprocessing and spreadsheet packages, Word and Excel.
Wallace and Erickson have made this into an exciting tale, told in the racy
style of American business journalism, with plenty of detail and well
researched quotations, all focused on the enigmatic personality of Bill
Gates. He emerges as a mildly unpleasant night owl with few interests
besides writing and selling computer algorithms. He relaxes by breaking the
speed limit, but cannot, it seems, fit women into his busy schedule nor find
time for many of the usual forms of relaxation. He screams abuse at his
employees and forces them to work inhuman hours. Yet work they do, at a
frenzied pace, and many are now millionaires through stock options.
By the end of the book one cannot help liking this appallingly ambitious and
lonesome brat. And if one should ask: 'What shall it profit a man that he
should gain the whole world . . . ?', the answer is that Gates's Dollars 8bn
represents, not just his winnings, but an important contribution to one of
the great revolutions in human history.

   Seven feet long, with a jaw full of evil teeth, the alligator lurking nearby is one mean matron. 
So Dane Ledet doesn't linger by the muddy mound of swamp grass where he has just landed in a helicopter. 
Within seconds, he scoops the 36 fresh eggs from her nest and scrambles back into the waiting copter. 

   A scene from "Louisiana Jones and the Jaws of Death?" 
No, this is farming. 
Mr. Ledet is merely replenishing his herd -- by raiding an alligator's nest. 
He is one of a new strain of courageous entrepreneurs who farms alligators. 

   Alligators have yet to find a welcome mat at Louisiana parish fairs. 
Who wants to hang a ribbon on a critter that might eat it, along with your arm? 
Nobody oohs and aahs over alligators at 4-H Club exhibits, either. 
At Louisiana's finest country clubs, gentlemen farmers still talk racehorses -- not alligators. 

   Nonetheless, alligators are becoming important livestock in this state. 
Farmers from Natchitoches to New Orleans have begun to raise them, forgoing blue ribbons for cash. 
Prices on alligator hides and meat have reached record highs, although they may not stay so high if the supply keeps increasing. 

   State wildlife officials expect that nearly 75,000 alligators will be raised this year on Louisiana's farms, triple the herd in 1987. 
Veteran alligator farmers complain that newcomers are constantly hounding them for advice. 
More than 200 people are on a waiting list for state alligator-farm permits. 
Alligator sections have been added to aquaculture classes in state universities. 

   Alligator skins once were the booty of poachers who devastated the alligator population and helped put "alligator mississippiensis" on the endangered species list and helped make alligator products unfashionable. 
But the wild population has exploded in recent years, and the alligator was delisted in 1987. 

   By then, after years of experimental alligator husbandry, Ted Joanen and Larry McNease, Louisiana wildlife researchers, had already successfully promoted alligator farming. 
They saw it as a way to stop poaching, ensure a supply of skins and foster new business that was desperately needed in a state whose economy was depressed by the oil glut. 
To protect the species, state law requires farmers to return a sizable portion -- 17% this year -- of their nurtured, four-foot-long stock to the wild. 

   Raising alligators is different from raising cows. 
The alligator has a walnut-size brain. 
But its jaws can snap a farmer's arm like a breadstick; they exert a force of 3,000 pounds a square inch. 
Stealing their eggs, corralling the critters and hauling them to market are hazardous. 

   Alligators lack a strong herding instinct. 
About a month ago, Skeet Rogers, proud new part-owner of Bayou Pierre Gator Farm in Natchitoches, had to move half of his 2,000 alligator herd into a larger barn. 
He first thought to move them through a "chute" made from sheets of tin. 

   "We were going to herd 'em like cattle with sticks," he says. 
"It was a mess. 
They tried to climb over each other and they started fighting." 
With the help of 14 leery volunteers, each wearing two pairs of thick leather gloves to protect his hands, Mr. Rogers hand-carried the alligators from barn to barn. 

   At market time, Mr. Rogers loads some 200 live four-foot gators into an old, gutted school bus for the hour-and-a-half drive to Ville Platte. 
Only a sheet of plywood separates the driver from his passengers. 
The driver is "usually the guy who draws the shortest straw. 
I'm serious," says Mr. Rogers, adding: "Usually a car follows -- just in case." 

   Like most alligator farmers in Louisiana, Mr. Rogers houses his animals in half-sunken tin-sided structures of cinder blocks on concrete slabs. 
Inside one of these barns, the temperature is a humid 89 degrees, just about right for gators. 
They are at home in a few inches of water reeking of reptile urine. 

   The smell takes some getting used to. 
On their uncle Raywood Stelly's Raywood's Kajun Alligator Farms at Kaplan, the 17-year-old Stelly twins, Velma and Thelma, daily plop gobs of feed mix to the gators as part of their farm chores. 
The feed is one part nutria, a prolific swamp rat; one part croaker, an inexpensive fish, and one part vitamin-fortified dry food that a producer packs in sacks labeled Alligator Feed. 
"The first time we did this, I couldn't believe it," says Thelma, her arms sunk in a bucket of bloody nutria carcasses. 

   "Now we're used to it -- almost," says Velma, swatting at a swarm of flies around her head. 

   To build their herds without having to collect eggs, some farmers buy them for $5 to $8 each. 
But most collect their own, paying landowners for the rights to do so, and search by airboat and helicopter. 
They work over a three-week laying period that usually comes in June. 
Newly hatched alligators "come out mean as hell and biting," a farmer says. 

   In Ville Platte, Steele McAndrew collects eggs on his own pond, where he keeps his breeding stock. 
Checking the pond, he totes a 10-foot plastic pipe to fend off his ungracious wards. 
As he nears a nest, a seven-foot gator appears from nowhere, hissing and blowing at him in the heat of midmorning. 

   "These are like bears in a park," he says, easing the pipe a few feet from the reptile's snout. 
"They don't have any fear left in them." 
Before Mr. McAndrew can finish, the alligator jumps and sprints toward him in short bursts. 
Then it seizes the tooth-scarred pipe in its jaws. 

   So ferocious is the animal that Mr. McAndrew guesses her eggs lie nearby. 
He hatches the precious eggs he collects in an incubator. 
If the heat exceeds 91 degrees or drops below 89, the eggs are endangered, and a heat-sensitive alarm rings in Mr. McAndrew's bedroom. 

   Mr. McAndrew was one of the pioneer Louisiana alligator farmers eight years ago. 
His farm, which is becoming part of a joint venture, will soon expand to 30,000 alligators from 6,000. 
He concedes that an alligator farm isn't exactly the Garden of Eden. 
"A 90-degree building, 100% humidity, rancid meat, getting splashed with alligator urine and water -- it's just not ideal conditions," he says, adding that "a lot of people in Louisiana are desperate." 

   Alligator hides fetch the farmer $39 a linear foot. 
Farm-bred gators, whose hides are used for handbags and other small goods, typically are slaughtered when they are four feet long. 
Hides from bigger, wild alligators, used for luggage, bring about $48 a foot. 
A field-dressed four-foot-long alligator brings farmers about $20 for the meat. 

   There are alligator farms in Florida and Texas, too. 
But alligator-farm technical knowledge and state support is centered here; for nearly 20 years, Messrs. 
Joanen and McNease did their research on alligators in captivity in the marsh at Rockefeller Refuge in southern Louisiana. 
Foreign countries, mainly in Africa, have engineered their alligator and crocodile farming enterprises on the Louisiana model. 

   The market for alligators would be larger, alligator men say, if it weren't for the mistaken belief that the alligator is endangered. 
Even with increases in demand over the past few years, the world market for crocodile and alligator hides has regained only half the volume of 15 years ago. 
"It's not mass fashion right now," says Lee Goldman, president of Campaign Inc., distributor of Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. alligator products. 
But, he says, "If there are more skins available, they're reasonably priced and they look good, I'm all in favor of it." 

   Nature lovers, Mr. Joanen says, should consider that the farmers who skin alligators also are returning healthy four-footers to the wild. 
"If you want to help the marsh, and the alligator," he says, "buy an alligator handbag."

FT  12 NOV 93 / Management: Microsoft's loud mouse - Bill Gates' number two
talks to Alan Cane and Tim Dickson about the future of the computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To comprehend the computer industry, it was once essential to understand
International Business Machines, hardware manufacturer par excellence and
industry leader for three decades.
Today, with IBM fighting red ink and loss of market share, the model is
Microsoft, the aggressive young pretender to IBM's crown. Creator of MS/Dos
and Windows, the operating systems which control more than 90 per cent of
the world's personal computers, the company has begun to influence others in
a way reminiscent of its older rival.
Microsoft, however, is living in a changed world and the management and
strategic challenges are correspondingly different. While IBM wanted total
control of its customer, Microsoft is increasingly focusing on what it
believes it does best, designing and producing quality software. As Steve
Ballmer, responsible for the company's sales and marketing activities,
points out: 'We cannot do everything. As a result, to reach large businesses
we will have to forge relationships with new business partners - not just
the distributors we have always dealt with, but companies developing
specific software solutions to their customers' problems.'
Microsoft's management philosophy, explains Ballmer, is 'ultimately
conservative'. Much of this is rooted in the personality of Bill Gates,
Microsoft's 38-year-old co-founder, chairman and chief executive, whose
parsimony and competitiveness are equally notorious. But Ballmer, a
37-year-old college friend of Gates and effectively Microsoft's joint number
two, is clearly a thoughtful and assertive influence.
'When I started (in 1980), Microsoft had 30 people. When I had been there
two months, I told Bill I thought we ought to hire 17 more people. He said:
'I think we are going to go bankrupt if I keep you here. I'm not sure this
is going to work out'.'
Ballmer stayed and Microsoft did not go bankrupt. The success of its
operating systems on IBM-style PCs, its computer languages and applications
programs turned it into the world's most successful packaged software
supplier. Last year it had sales of Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn), up 36 per
cent on the year before and net income of Dollars 953m.
The changing marketplace will test both its adaptability and technical
expertise. Microsoft has proved itself the king of the electronic desktop,
providing operating systems, word processors and spreadsheets for people
using stand-alone personal computers. But as large companies seek to link
their computers together and establish enterprise-wide information networks,
how will the company react?
Windows NT, Microsoft's latest operating system, is the company's
technological answer, but Microsoft, as Ballmer readily agrees, has less
experience of corporate data processing than, for example, IBM or Unisys.
Ballmer says Microsoft has more experience than many people realise, but
adds: 'I am not convinced that IBM or Unisys - where one company supplied
hardware, software and services - is the model for the 1990s. In our model
we focus on what we do best, which is to build software products. Others
build hardware, deliver services and design custom developments.
'We have to mobilise an infrastructure around our products or people will
not design them into their systems. We have to explain that model to our
corporate customers. We are not going to be a cradle-to-grave supplier. If
people want a company to integrate their hardware or write a custom
application, that company is not going to be us.'
Can Microsoft, however, continue to dominate the software business and avoid
'doing an IBM'?
As Ballmer tells it - his style is engagingly direct, the decibel count
unusually high - the company can hardly be accused of complacency. He
describes a culture which reflects a nervous, almost paranoid concern with
staying ahead. 'We are certainly paranoid enough about the potential to fail
that we are looking very hard for the potholes in the road.'
Having Gates around evidently helps. 'Bill is good at saying: 'I don't care
how good things seem to most people. I see deep problems',' explains
Ballmer.
Conscious of the technological obsolescence pothole into which IBM stumbled,
Microsoft has one senior employee (Nathan Mirvald, vice-president of
advanced technology) constantly scanning the horizon for new business
threats.
Ballmer distinguishes three phases in the company's development. The first
was characterised by a focus on technology and on business ('before you hire
anyone or do anything, get a customer'), but there was little management
vision. 'Bill had all these envelopes with all the contracts written down
and everybody in the company and their salaries and he was doing these
calculations over and over to make sure there was enough of this to cover
that,' Ballmer recalls.
In the second phase, Jon Shirley of Tandy Corporation was hired to inject
some business sense into a technologically aggressive company which was
being strangled by tight purse strings. 'Jon helped us grow the management
structure that enabled us to do the investing that I wanted and that Paul
Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, wanted. It was what Bill wanted to do as well
but he did not have the confidence.'
Shirley has since retired, although he keeps in close contact with the
company. A replacement did not work out and the company established an
'office of the president' last year to support Gates. It comprised Ballmer
as head of sales, Mike Maples, head of the products group, and the late
Frank Gaudette, who had been chief financial officer.
The challenge now, Ballmer says, is how best to present a unified approach
to its customers, while allowing the separate divisions considerable
autonomy. 'We spend a lot of time pushing ourselves. How do we become a
global company? How do we measure the effectiveness of a sales operation
when we are working with partners? If there is a price war you don't want to
be the guy caught with higher overheads and processing costs than others
because you've been sloppy.'
Microsoft's success has made a lot of its employees potentially very rich
through share options and that has helped to maintain the youthful
aggression of the culture: 'Any senior executive at Microsoft can retire if
they want to. The nice thing about having people make money is that they
don't stick around unless they want to,' Ballmer says. 'They stick around
because they want to work hard and are excited about what we are doing. It
is a nice filtering process.'
He and Gates, he says, are good for at least another 10 years. 'We don't
work as hard as we used to, but we still work very hard and we love it.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Magic market for Microsoft - The world's
biggest software company has a mission to 'edutain'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe, describes his ambitions in
multimedia carefully. Without wanting to appear arrogant, he says, he wants
to be the leading supplier of educational and other programmes  - sometimes
known as 'edutainment' - published on CD-Rom. These are the building bricks
of the multimedia revolution.
Microsoft, the world's largest software company, helped pioneer the genre in
1992 with Musical Instruments, a CD-Rom ideally suited to demonstrating the
combination of text, video and quality sound which characterises multimedia
presentations.
Today, Musical Instruments still impresses but looks dated compared with
newer offerings such as The Magic School Bus, a series to be released
shortly. It is said to be Microsoft president Bill Gates's current
favourite, and features a yellow US school bus with driver and passengers
which can be shrunk to navigate through the digestive system in The Human
Body or the cosmos in The Solar System. Microsoft's best-selling Dinosaurs
of 18 months ago included five moving video clips; Dangerous Creatures, a
new release, has more than 100.
Vergnes, who has worked for Microsoft since 1983 and has been its European
president since 1990, believes that the domestic market for CD-Rom is about
to expand rapidly, especially in Europe. He reckons that personal computers
equipped for multimedia will reach the 'magic price' this Christmas at which
substantial domestic sales can be expected.
He defines that price as just below Pounds 1,000 in Britain or FFr10,000 in
France. For this, customers will get a PC built around a high-performance
Intel 486 or 'Pentium' chip with 16 megabytes of fast memory and a
300-megabyte hard disc together with a CD-Rom player and sound capabilities.
In France, he says, some 25 per cent of PC sales are now through
supermarkets. Carrefour, the large French chain, is marketing its own range
of five models, some of which can handle multimedia.
Microsoft is taking the home market seriously. It has some 500-600 people,
including educationists, psychologists and software specialists, in its
consumer group, and is spending just under Dollars 100m a year on developing
new titles. Sales are about Dollars 300m a year.
In total, Microsoft spends about Dollars 600m on research and development,
most of it on software, which brings a much greater financial return. 'We
are over-investing for the future in these areas,' says Vergnes.
Success in consumer markets is critical to Microsoft's plans. Its worldwide
sales - Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 2.97bn) last year - comprise desktop
applications, PC operating systems, word processors, spreadsheets and
database managers. Revenue growth last year was 24 per cent.
However, Vergnes admits that 'the traditional PC software market will not
grow forever. One day, probably sooner rather than later, most desktops in
developed countries will have a PC with a complete suite of business
programs'.
The company plans to reach sales of Dollars 8bn by 1995-96, but Vergnes says
the extra Dollars 3bn will not come entirely from desktop applications.
'Unless we make at least Dollars 1bn from consumer products, we shall not
achieve our target.'
He is encouraged by research showing that each professional PC installed
leads to purchases of - on average - five software packages during its life.
But up to 15 purchases of software a year can be expected for domestic PCs
if the price is right. The consumer software division is turning out three
new titles a month.
The competition is not sitting idle. Microsoft's principal competitors,
Lotus Development Corporation and Novell, have their own consumer products
divisions. Recently Novell, the market leader in networking, announced a
series of home education CD-Roms focusing on reading, writing and
arithmetic.
Microsoft's ambitions in multimedia, however, range across the board. It is
spending about Dollars 120m a year on software for the digital superhighway
through its advanced consumer technology research group, an elite operation
headed by chief technologist Nathan Myhrvold and reporting directly to Bill
Gates.
Microsoft interprets the highway as an electronic pipeline into each home
able to convey an almost limitless stream of information. Database computers
or servers provide the data which is unscrambled by a black box on top of
the television set. Earlier this year Myhrvold's group announced 'Tiger':
video server software which Microsoft says is the first phase of a complex,
interactive video system.
It runs on conventional personal computers. According to Vergnes: 'We
believe that traditional PC technology will develop fast enough so that we
can build these servers from inexpensive hardware. We can share the
processing load between the network server and the set-top box which, after
all, is only a powerful personal computer.'
There is, thus, a close similarity between Microsoft's model of the
information superhighways and the modern data-processing concept of
client-server computing where server computers provide data to a network of
PCs.
Microsoft's latest operating software, Windows NT, is intended to manage
client-server networks. Indeed, Vergnes believes that business will be first
to find applications for the information superhighway, with domestic
applications following later.
He echoes Bill Gates's complaints that most multimedia trials involve only
video-on-demand (VOD) - the ability to call a video of choice to the TV
screen. While technically complex, he does not believe that VOD is a true
test of demand for multimedia services.
In consequence, Microsoft's own trials - to be held with the US company TCI
in Denver and Seattle next year - will be sophisticated and involve a range
of services. Example: Vergnes envisages an education forum where teachers
from a broad range of schools and colleges could exchange views and
experience.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (4):
'Evolutionary rather than revolutionary' - Multimedia in the office / Bill
Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, has poured scorn on most of the
multimedia trials in the US and Europe, reports Alan Cane. Microsoft is
meanwhile investing Dollars 100m a year in multimedia and aims to set the
agenda in the technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, is
harnessing its resources to a new goal: leadership in the design of
multimedia systems.
It is already investing over Dollars 100m a year - out of an research and
development budget of Dollars 473m - on the critical operating software. Mr
Bill Gates, the company's founder and chairman, said earlier this month that
the company had more people working on multimedia than any other software
group.
The implication is that the company wants to establish its software as the
global standard in multimedia just as its MS/DOS and Windows operating
systems are the world standard for IBM's design of personal computers.
There have been some early clues: Microsoft is already working with Sega,
the Japanese games console manufacturer, on an operating system for a new
machine, although Mr Gates says the project is small and divorced from
Microsoft's mainline operating systems development.
Some weeks ago, it bought Soft Image, a Canadian company which is market
leader in the esoteric discipline of software for moving picture animation.
The special effects in the film Jurassic Park are its work.
Furthermore, it has announced it intends to test its multimedia software in
collaboration with Tele-Communications Inc.,( TCI), the largest US cable
operator. A first fruit from the venture will be a new channel of
programming aimed at the consumer market for computer hardware, software and
accessories.
What Microsoft intends to provide is the operating software which will
manage the flow of information of all kinds on to high speed networks and
the software which will connect it to personal computer operating systems in
the home or office. It may also provide some of the applications - a
personal money management program, for example.
Mr Gates says 'there are a lot of companies developing software for the
'information highway,' just as there were a lot of companies involved in
operating systems at the beginning of the personal computer business.
Everybody who is doing multimedia software will have lots of pilots. Based
on the quality of those pilots, some will emerge stronger than others'.
Mr Gates said Microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the
US and Europe in 1995. He did not expect substantial returns on his
investment for five years, although he thought that there would be
substantive developments in multimedia in 1996-97 with entire cities
converted to interactive networks.
Multimedia and the 'information superhighway,' the high-capacity network
which will link vast repositories of information with modified television
sets or personal computers, are creating intense interest among computer
companies, telecommunications organisations and entertainment firms. They
are jockeying to take advantage of what are expected to be lucrative new
business opportunities.
Bill Gates, however, argues that most are taking the wrong approach - 'dead
ends' were how he described them - 'because the user-interface is so simple,
and because they do not tie in to personal computers in the right way, the
results will be disappointing. The revenue and the usage that comes out of
them will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.'
most of the trials to date have been designed to exploit domestic
multimedia, offering, typically, menus of video films for home viewing, Mr
Gates says that business will make use of the multimedia first.
'The first widespread use of these capabilities will be in business,' he
predicted. 'It will involve things like video-conferencing and collaboration
which would enable you to do your job without going into the office. Or it
could help companies find expertise to help them out without the expert
having to travel.
'The network itself could create electronic markets able to find a resource
of any type.'
'So, what in the past we have seen as electronic markets for currencies or
stocks will move into items of all types where chequeing references and
other kinds of working together can be done very effectively in electronic
form.'
'This will be done by extending the range of the personal computer. One of
the early symptoms will be very low cost video conferencing where a PC is
connected up to an ISDN (integrated services digital network). Within two or
three years this will be extremely widespread.
(Intel, which makes the microprocessors used in the majority of the world's
personal computers, earlier this year announced a low-cost set of components
capable of turning a personal computer into a video-conferencing terminal).
Mr Gates thought that multimedia in the office would be evolutionary rather
than revolutionary, driven by proven technologies like electronic mail -
'the benefits of electronic mail are unbelievable. We could not run
Microsoft without that capability.
'Today, some think of electronic mail and work group software and the
Internet (an open, publicly available computer network spanning several
continents) as separate things, but with some enhancements to Windows due in
less than a year, we will bring all these things together.'
Once the technology and benefits have been established in a business
environment, that would be the time to move into the home.
Mr Gates was critical of the narrow range of many of the current multimedia
trials: 'Some of the early pilots will be particularly embarrassing because
they will not have the breadth of applications,' he said.
'The network operators running these pilots are acting against their own
interests because they are going to prove exactly what they do not want to
prove - that there will not be enough revenue generated to justify building
the infrastructure.'
'Until you have a broad range of applications, you will never be able to
demonstrate the true potential of these systems. That is why instead of
doing crummy pilots in 1994, we will start our trials in 1995.'
He extended his criticism to Oracle, the US database specialist with which
British Telecommunications has formed an alliance to test interactive
entertainment services in the home. Oracle will provide the software and
systems integration: 'I'm sure Oracle will change its approach because it is
a terrible approach,' he said.
Bill Gates' comments have to be seen against a background of intense
competition in the nascent multimedia business. Furthermore, he has never
been slow to promote Microsoft's efforts and pick holes in the competition.

   OS/2, the new PC operating system Microsoft announced for
IBM three years ago, today is an also-ran. It requires too
much computer memory, and some promised features haven't
arrived. It also can't run Windows applications.
   Microsoft has sold only a few hundred thousand copies of
OS/2. Mr. Gates seems to be trying to lower expectations for
it, saying he now expects it to coexist with the current PC
standard, MS-DOS, for years instead of replacing it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With IBM, Microsoft is at work on a new version of OS/2
that will run Windows. It will also make better use of the
most popular microprocessor, Intel's 80386. "We have to
provide a seamless, easy transition from the old to the new,"
says Microsoft president Jon Shirley. "That's something we've
failed to do in prior versions of OS/2." Mr. Gates insists
OS/2 will emerge later in the decade as the operating
software of choice for PC users.
   "People said we'd fail" with Windows, he says. "Now
they're saying we'll fail with OS/2. We won't."
   For Microsoft's sake, it better not. OS/2 is the only
operating system the company controls with as much power as
Unix, an older system created by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, which is the standard for engineering and
scientific computers and is slowly catching on with
white-collar workers.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft's settlement of anti-trust charges with the US Justice Department
and European competition authorities will have 'no material impact' on
financial performance, according to Mr Bill Gates, chairman and founder of
the software company.
The settlement, which requires Microsoft to modify its operating system
licensing practices, 'eliminates something that could have become a major
distraction', Mr Gates said yesterday.
He reiterated his belief that Microsoft had never done anything
'inappropriate or illegal'. The company's success in selling operating
systems programs for PCs was based on demand, not on licensing terms.
Industry analysts said Microsoft 'got off easy' on Justice Department
charges that it 'built a barricade of exclusionary and unreasonably
restrictive licensing agreements to deny others an opportunity to develop
and market competing products'.
Investors appeared to concur with this view as Microsoft's share price rose
Dollars 1 7/8 yesterday to reach Dollars 50 1/2 by the close.
Mr Gates said Microsoft's future remained dependent upon its ability to
'continue to come up with great products'. The settlement provided the
company with an opportunity to do that without the burden of a costly legal
battle.
Competition authorities had examined several issues raised by competitors,
Microsoft said. Most were not pursued and the settlement covered only
licensing practices and non-disclosure.
The settlement does not address concern in the software industry that
Microsoft gains unfair advantages as a developer of both operating systems,
which control the basic functions of a computer, and applications programs
such as wordprocessors, games and spreadsheets.
Microsoft is the largest seller of applications for use with its own Windows
operating system. This dual role is its principal advantage, according to
software industry executives, because Microsoft's applications developers
have earlier and better access to details of next-generation systems than
their competitors.
However, Mr Bill Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said this issue did
not come up in the discussions. 'We can conclude that the government decided
that it had no basis on which to act on these complaints.'
For the next six and a half years, the duration of the settlement,
Microsoft's business activities will be monitored by the US Justice
Department and European competition authorities.

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Bill Gates swears he doesn't mean
Apple any harm.
   Maybe so. But Windows 3.0, a product he's so proud of that
even his mother will be on hand when Microsoft unveils it
tomorrow, presents the most formidable technical challenge
ever to the Macintosh, Apple Computer's main computer family.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gates says he has always been interested in making PCs
easy to use. But he insists that only recently have they
grown powerful enough to handle the images and split-screens
needed to control them with simple, intuitive commands.
   Yet Apple did precisely this six years ago, and became the
second largest supplier of personal computers in the world.
Apple created for its Macintosh a new system software, the
program that controls basic operations such as storing files
and sending documents to a printer. The Macintosh operating
system was entirely different from Microsoft's MS-DOS, the
standard for most other desktop computers.
   In MS-DOS, programs' effectiveness is restricted by memory
limitations, and users risk confusion if they forget arcane
command codes. The Macintosh gave the user visual cues to
simplify mundane tasks like copying documents or storing
files.
   Now Microsoft's new Windows, after two earlier,
disappointing Windows versions, comes close to matching the
most compelling features of the Macintosh. And it does so
within the familiar MS-DOS standard, so consumers don't have
to jettison their old programs. Windows even promises a
feature that Macintoshes won't have until next year: the
ability to automatically exchange data between two different
programs.
   Computer experts say the Macintosh system still makes it
simpler to start up the machine, store files and hook up
printers, among other things. But those differences may not
overshadow the major advantage of PCs that use MS-DOS and
Windows: They are far less expensive.
   Apple has less-costly models on the way. It will introduce
a color Macintosh for less than $2,000 as early as this fall.
And it doesn't concede that Windows is its equal: "Microsoft
is very good at comparing their intentions with our
realities," says Jim Davis, Apple's director of systems
software marketing.
   But Apple takes Windows seriously enough that it has sued
Microsoft charging copyright infringement. Apple also worries
that it is too dependent on Microsoft for applications -- the
three best-selling packages for the Macintosh are made by
Microsoft -- and that in the future Microsoft may give less
attention to Macintosh applications. Over the years, some at
Apple have called for breaking with Mr. Gates, fearing that
his secret plan is to weaken Apple's position by imposing a
single software standard for all desktop users.
   Yet today Mr. Gates enjoys cordial relations with Apple
chief executive John Sculley. About two months ago, he even
spent several hours helping Mr. Sculley hash out Apple's
technical direction.
   Mr. Gates says the way for Apple to keep its edge is to
continue to deliver new ways of controlling the PC-voice,
handwriting, multimedia, whatever. But "Apple needs to
focus," he says. "John agrees. Now let's see if he picks the
right areas."

<LEADPARA>  For most people, nightmares end with the dawn. For Bill Gates, the
hard-driving chairman of Microsoft Corp., who is known to keep pictures of his
opponents in his office, they linger during the day as well.;    In a "state
of the company" memo written for his top staff, Gates said some of his worst
fears for his billion-dollar software company -- normally seen as being on top
of the world -- are coming true.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LOOK WHO'S GAINING
2 MICROSOFT'S GATES EYES CHALLENGES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Our nightmare -- IBM 'attacking' us in system software, Novell 'defeating'
us in networking and more agile, customer-oriented applications competitors
getting their Windows act together -- is a reality," Gates wrote.;    But
plucky in the face of those threats, Gates said Microsoft has a simple
response to its competition -- the Windows software control program that has
been a runaway success since its introduction last year.;    "Just as DEC's
strategy for the '80s was VAX, our strategy for the '90s is Windows -- one
evolving architecture, a couple of implementations. Everything we do should
focus on making Windows more successful," he wrote.;    The memo, issued last
month and obtained by the Mercury News, shows Gates not as the arrogant
multibillionaire of legend but instead as a CEO whose mind never strays far
from threats to the Redmond, Wash., company he co-founded.;    His attention
runs to questions of long-term importance, such as the need to work with
Japanese companies on software for digital consumer electronics. But he's also
well-versed in industry minutiae, such as passing along rumors that Scotts
Valley-based Borland International Inc. will include a word-processing program
in the upcoming Windows version of its Quattro Pro spreadsheet.;    At the top
of Gates' list of problems are two legal disputes the company is involved in
-- a copyright suit brought by Apple Computer Inc., which has so far gone well
for Microsoft, and a Federal Trade Commission antitrust inquiry.;    "If the
judge (in the Apple case) rules against us without making it clear what we
have to change or asks us to eliminate something fundamental to all windowing
systems (like overlapping windows), it would be disastrous," he wrote.;    He
also wrote, "Certainly I take the FTC inquiry seriously, and I am sure it will
use up even more executive staff time than the Apple lawsuit has. However, I
know we don't get unfair advantages. I hope we can quickly educate the FTC on
our business.";    There was some blunt language reserved for International
Business Machines Corp., with whom Microsoft has had a well-publicized dispute
about future computer operating systems.;    While working with IBM has forced
Microsoft to accept "poor code, poor design and other overhead," Gates wrote
that Microsoft "will not attack IBM as a company, and even our public
'attacks' on (IBM's) OS/2 will be very professional.;    "Eventually we need
to have at least a neutral relationship with IBM. For the next 24 months, it
may be fairly cold. We can emerge as a better and stronger company where
people won't just say we are the standard because IBM chose us.";    But he
admitted that Microsoft's greatest risk will be if IBM uses its connections at
Fortune 500 companies to freeze it out.;    Gates also conceded that Microsoft
has had a difficult time in making good on its promise of catching up to
Novell Inc., the industry's leading networking software company.;    "We knew
it wasn't going to be easy, but it has been even harder than we expected to
build a position in networking. You will see us backing off on some of our
spending level, but don't doubt that we are totally committed to the
business.";    In other portions of the memo, Gates admitted Microsoft's
customer support record was bad. "The number of customers who get a bad
impression because of this must be in the millions worldwide.";   
Microsoft-watchers who were shown the memo said it again revealed him to be on
top of all aspects of his business.;    "A lot of CEOs at successful companies
have a sense of complacency," said Dataquest's Marshall Mosely. "But Gates has
a healthy respect for that which can harm him. I think that's commendable."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  COMPUTER; SOFTWARE; COMPANY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Microsoft Corp. has rented a yacht and hired the Dave Brubeck quartet to
announce a new version of the world's most widely used computer software.;   
Microsoft says the rollout Tuesday will be the biggest launch of a new
software product in computer industry history.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MICROSOFT PLANS SPLASHY LAUNCH FOR DOS 5.0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The new product is an update of MS-DOS, the base layer of software used on
an estimated 60 million IBM-type personal computers worldwide. It provides
enhanced features compared with older versions of DOS, including more
available memory and a new "help" feature.;    The new DOS also moves the
software closer in appearance and features to Windows, a Microsoft product
that makes IBM-type computers easier to use. Windows has been a runaway
success since Microsoft introduced an improved version a year ago.;    DOS is
a type of software called an operating system, which controls a computer's
internal functions. On top of it, a computer user runs application programs
such as spreadsheets and word-processing programs.;    To emphasize the
importance Microsoft places on the new product, called DOS 5.0, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates has rented the dinner-cruise yacht New Yorker for a news
conference in the Hudson River. Dining and dancing to the music of Dave
Brubeck is included.;    An extensive advertising and marketing campaign will
follow.;    Microsoft, the largest software maker, hopes its splashy launch of
DOS 5.0 will help it overcome the disappointing sales of the last major DOS
update. DOS 4.0, announced three years ago, failed to take off -- partly
because it was riddled with bugs -- and most owners of IBM-type computers
continue to use earlier DOS versions.;    To avoid similar quality problems
with DOS 5.0, Microsoft conducted what it called the most extensive testing
program in personal computer software history. About 7,000 users were given
advance copies to find bugs and make suggestions.;    "We learned from our
mistakes," said Brad Chase, the DOS 5.0 product manager.;    Another problem
with DOS 4.0 was that it actually took up more computer memory space than
previous versions. DOS 5.0 gives computer users more memory than all earlier
DOS versions so programs run better.;    Microsoft says it will make DOS 5.0
available to personal computer makers and, for the first time in a DOS
upgrade, directly to existing personal computer owners. Previous DOS upgrades
were available to personal computer owners only through the computer makers
themselves.;    Microsoft says it will sell a $99.95 kit to upgrade earlier
versions of DOS to DOS 5.0 through about 7,000 computer stores. In addition,
130 personal computer makers worldwide have licensed DOS 5.0 for use in new
computers.;    Industry analyst Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. said
she believes DOS 5.0 will be a hit.;    "I think it's an important upgrade.
Microsoft is going to market it aggressively," she said. "The feedback (from
testers) has been very strong.";    She said Microsoft could sell about 8
million upgrade kits for DOS 5.0. She estimated Microsoft would make about $30
profit on each, or a total of $240 million.;    Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Wash., earned $279.2 million on revenue of $1.18 billion in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1990.;    In addition to providing more memory and "help" text
that pops up in boxes on the computer screen, DOS 5.0 reconfigures the way the
screen looks to make it more user-friendly.;    DOS 5.0 borrows some of its
screen appearance from Windows, a program that is layered on top of DOS,
replacing DOS' arcane typed commands with graphical symbols (icons) and a
hand-held control device (a mouse) like those of Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh line of personal computers.;    But despite DOS 5.0's ease-of-use
features, Chase said Microsoft doesn't believe it will compete with Windows.; 
  Chase said he believes corporations will install DOS 5.0 on older personal
computers that cannot use Windows to prepare employees for the conversion to
Windows-equipped personal computers.  </TEXT>

<HL> Results in Industry First
For Computer Whiz Kid

   William Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., became the personal computer industry's first billion-dollar man yesterday. 

   The 31-year-old Harvard University dropout holds 11,018,955 shares, or about a 42% stake in Microsoft, which supplies, among other things, the internal program that controls the basic functions of International Business Machines Inc.'s PC line of personal computers and compatible machines. 

   The magic number for the billion-dollar mark for Mr. Gates's stake was a share price of $90.75, and the stock rose above and dipped below that level during the day. 
Microsoft finally closed at $91.25, up $1.75, in national over-the-counter trading, which brought the value of his stake to $1,005,479,643.75. 

   Mr. Gates, who was traveling in South America, wasn't available for comment on his new distinction. 
In recent months, colleagues and competitors had begun to jokingly refer to Mr. Gates as "Billion Dollar Bill" as the paper value of his fortune swelled. 

   Mr. Gates is the biggest beneficiary of an astonishing run-up in the price of Microsoft shares. 
The shares, which first were offered to the public a little more than a year ago for $21 each, have been outpacing the booming stock markets in recent months, and have nearly doubled in value since the end of the year. 

   "Is there a premium in the stock price because of Bill Gates?" asked Richard Sherlund, an analyst who follows the company for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
"I'd have to say yes, because he is considered one of the brightest people in the industry." 
Mr. Sherlund also said Microsoft's role "at the focal point of the personal computer industry" -- supplying operating system software to both IBM and other manufacturers -- has driven market enthusiasm for the stock. 

   Not even the founders of Apple Computer Inc., Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, came close to building billion-dollar fortunes in personal computers, even though they practically fathered that industry. 

   In high-technology businesses, only H. Ross Perot, who founded Electronic Data Systems Corp., now the data-processing services division of General Motors Corp., and David Packard and William Hewlett, founders of computer and scientific instrument maker Hewlett-Packard Co., have the distinction of building personal fortunes estimated to exceed $1 billion.

<LEADPARA>  A Seattle judge has agreed that billionaire Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has
been the victim of harassment. Gates has been bothered via the tool that made
him famous: the computer. In what may be one of the first cases of high-tech
harassment, a former Microsoft saleswoman Monday was ordered to stay away from
Microsoft -- and Gates -- both physically and electronically. Microsoft said
Joan Brewer had been sending Gates a steady stream of unwelcome messages over
an electronic mail system. Brewer earlier had claimed that she -- not Gates --
was the victim of harassment, though the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission dismissed her complaint. Now, King County District Judge William
Roarty has told Brewer any contact she makes with Microsoft must be through
the company's legal department.  </LEADPARA>

   More than 5,000 hunters met Friday's
deadline to apply for just 235 licenses in Florida's first
alligator hunt in 25 years. The lucky winners won't be allowed to
use guns.
   Once an endangered species, the American alligator now numbers
about 1 million in Florida and is increasingly encountering humans
as the state's people population also grows.
   A 4-year-old girl was killed by an alligator in May near her
family's lakeside home in Englewood, in southwest Florida, but
planning for the hunt had been under way long before that.
   The Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission gave final approval
Friday, during a meeting in Ocala, for the trapping and killing of
up to 3,425 alligators in 20 wildlife management areas during the
30-day hunt this fall. That quote assumes that not every hunter
will get his full 15-animal limit.
   Commission spokesman Scott Ball said 15,000 applications were
printed and he was surprised that only 5,000 people applied.
   ``A lot of people have been calling up in the last few days that
have been procrastinating and kicking themselves for waiting until
the last minute,'' said Ball. ``They are asking about next year.''
   The sanctioned hunts will occur only at night and trappers will
have to use snares, harpoons, spears or similar weapons to get a
gator close enough to kill. The only firearm allowed will be a
``bangstick,'' a pole with a shotgun shell on the end that is used
to kill a gator once it is snared and brought up to a boat, said
Ball.
   Part of the motivation for hunting gators may be economic. Gator
meat sells for about $5 a pound; hide sells for about $40 a foot.
   Florida residents selected by lottery for the hunt will have to
pay a $250 license fee, plus a $30 tag fee for each gator they
catch up. Out-of-state hunters will have to pay $1,000 for the
licenses.
   In addition to the license fees and tag fees, those awarded
licenses will have to go through a six-hour training course in
early August, said Ball.
   The targeted reptiles will have to be at least 4 feet long.
   The tag fee is to pay for inspection and verification that hides
being prepared for market are legal.
   ``It's tightly regulated so that only legal hides will be
brought to marketplace,'' said Ball. ``There are only a few
processors of hides. We keep an eye on them.''
   Since the mid-1960s, alligator hunting virtually has been banned
except for isolated experimental hunts since 1982 and the removal
of nuisance alligators in populated areas.

<LEADPARA>  Candor has its price, and for Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, it's
apparently $320 million.;    That was the amount that Gates' "paper fortune"
shrank Wednesday as the result of a 7 percent decline in Microsoft's stock
blamed on Wall Street reaction to Gates' memo on the numerous challenges
facing his company.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PAPER LOSSES: GATES' MEMO COST HIM MILLIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gates' six-page lament, originally intended for the Redmond, Wash.,
software supplier's senior staff but later leaked, told how Microsoft has
cultivated an opponent rather than an ally in IBM; how Microsoft has made no
inroads in the fast-growing networking marketplace; and how it stands to lose
sales to leaner competitors, such as Borland International Inc. of Scotts
Valley.;    Gates, who has a reputation as a competitor-obsessed worrier, ends
the memo on an upbeat note by trumpeting his strategy to make the Windows
control program an even bigger success. But Microsoft shares nonetheless fell
$8.13 to close at $103.38 in trading that was more than double normal levels.
At midday today, Microsoft was down to $100.;    Gates owns about a third of
the 115 million outstanding shares of Microsoft stock.;    Previously trading
at about 30 times earnings, Microsoft has long been one of Wall Street's
pricier stocks. Analysts said that by concentrating in a single document so
much bad news about Microsoft, the memo brought to the surface a lingering
investor concern that Microsoft might be overvalued.;    "The market is
pricing a new risk into the Microsoft story," said David Readerman, analyst at
Shearson Lehman in San Francisco.;    Despite the dramatic drop in the stock
price, Gates -- who was traveling in Europe on Wednesday -- should not
despair, as there is life after a self-critical memo.;    Ask Autodesk Inc.,
the Sausalito design software company whose stock is close to its 52-week high
despite a blistering 44-page memo by founder John Walker released 2 1/2 months
ago -- a document Gates cited as inspiration for his own.;    Walker called
his memo "The Final Days" and compared Autodesk to NASA before the explosion
of the space shuttle.;    "I am deeply concerned about the future of the
company," Walker wrote. "Autodesk possesses all the prerequisites to lead the
next generation of the PC industry, yet it seems to have become stuck in the
past, mired in bureaucracy, paralyzed by unwarranted caution and to have lost
the edge of rapid and responsive product development and aggressive marketing
and promotion on which the success of Autocad (its key product) was founded.";
   Walker, who retired from formal management tasks at the firm three years
ago but who still owns 4 percent of its stock, went on to make a number of
specific recommendations for the company, some of which have been implemented.
Others will be enacted in a reorganization planned for July 1, a spokesman
said.;    Walker's memo is in a long tradition of public self-criticism at
Autodesk; it was given out freely to the firm's 1,100 employees, and a dozen
previous efforts have been published in a book.;    Discussing the chance of a
memo being given to a competitor or reporter, the memo called such risks
"unavoidable consequences of placing the issues on Autodesk's agenda."  </TEXT>

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Bruised but not beaten - Microsoft is giving
mixed signals about its future prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, these are trying times. His company is
under scrutiny for alleged anti-trust violations; Wall Street has soured on
the stock; and after 18 years of spectacular growth Microsoft is planning
for a 'bumpy' year ahead. Could Microsoft have lost the golden touch that
has enabled it to become the largest software company in the world, made
Gates, 37, the richest man in the US and created hundreds of millionaires
among its employees?
This is the sort of question that irritates Gates. From his perspective,
Microsoft's achievements to date have nothing to do with a Midas charm,
rather they reflect hard work and perseverance, long-term vision and
commitment.
He has no patience with 'simplistic analysis' that assumes Microsoft will
inevitably be successful in anything the company turns its hand to. Or, as
is now the case, that short-term expectations for slower growth may signal
that Microsoft's glory days are coming to a close.
Indeed, predicting the outlook for Microsoft is complicated by numerous
issues. Not the least of these is whether Microsoft will face an anti-trust
suit. The US Justice Department is currently reviewing documents from a
three-and-a-half year investigation conducted by the US Federal Trade
Commission.
Other problems for Microsoft include a downward trend in software prices and
a weak market environment in Europe, one of its largest markets. With no big
operating system software product introductions planned for the next 12
months, Microsoft also faces an unusual dry spell. Revenues from the
company's core business - software for office PCs - may grow less rapidly
than in the past.
Yet the company is driving ahead with ambitious plans to enter new markets
such as programs for hand-held 'personal digital assistants,' software for
children, multimedia products and software for the 'digital highways' of the
future.
Microsoft is also developing two new generations of personal computer
operating systems; one for desktop PCs, codenamed Chicago, and a second,
called Cairo, for computer networks (see below).
But torn between blowing Microsoft's trumpet, to impress customers and
investors, or highlighting its vulnerabilities, to appease Washington
regulators, Gates and other Microsoft executives are delivering a mixed
message about the company's future prospects.
'In looking at this industry and Microsoft's role in it, I am very
optimistic,' Gates says. 'We are investing in a very optimistic way.'
In the next breath, however, he is urging caution. 'A number of these
investments may take a long time to pay off,' he says. 'If these new things
kick in, then we will go back to higher growth. If we're wrong, then we
won't ever advance beyond the level we are at today.'
Microsoft's propensity to point out the risks associated with entering new
markets, and that even its new PC software products could 'bomb', has
contributed to Wall Street's uncertainties.
'That tone of conservatism is part of our culture. We expect good results,
but prefer them to come as surprises,' Gates says. Yet veteran Microsoft
watchers believe that the company's recent emphasis on potential problems is
at least in part aimed at the ears of anti-trust regulators in Washington
DC.
For example, Microsoft is at pains to point out that it does have
competitors. Executives even highlighted rival products in a presentation to
financial analysts less than two weeks ago. And in an attempt to win
political support, Gates reels off the benefits which the PC industry has
provided to the US economy, such as growth in exports and the creation of
jobs.
'Today's software business is thriving, and it is not just Microsoft,' says
Gates. 'There are 750 software companies in the state of Washington alone
and the majority of them write software (applications programs) for
Microsoft Windows. Net employment went up by more than the size of Microsoft
just in the last year. . .the incredible thing is how well the US has done
in this business.' The Clinton administration would be foolish to do
anything that threatened the future of Microsoft, Gates seems to be
implying.
Politics aside, the greatest challenges facing Microsoft lie in the
development of a series of ground-breaking technologies. Gates is placing a
big bet on software for 'digital highways' - which could deliver multimedia
information services to millions of businesses and homes.
His goal is to establish a software standard for the way people use
information services, whether they be entertainment services on interactive
television, public information services at a kiosk in a shopping centre or
business information services in the office.
Partnerships - with cable television companies, telephone companies and
companies in the entertainment field - will be an important aspect of
Microsoft's involvement in digital highways. While denying reports that
Microsoft has already struck a deal, Gates acknowledges that Microsoft is
talking to US West as well as other US telephone companies, and TCI and Time
Warner, the two largest US cable television companies. The gold rush
surrounding 'digital convergence' also has movie moguls, newspaper
companies, AT&amp;T and IBM knocking on his door, Gates says.
'You will see us enter into all sorts of partnerships.' Some will merely be
agreements to collaborate in trials of interactive television service.
Others may be 'hard-core joint ventures'. Microsoft also plans to make
minority equity investments in companies involved in digital highways.
'I am not aware of any other company that is making the kind of bet that we
are on digital information highways,' Gates says. The company will spend
'many tens of millions of dollars' developing the technology, and 'won't get
any revenue for at least three years. And it could all be wasted, but that
is the name of the game'.
The 'game' of spotting new technology directions and turning them into
business opportunities is one at which Gates is a master and with Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in cash resources, Microsoft can even afford to lose a
few rounds.

<HEAD>Apple and Microsoft Pause in Legal Battle To Announce New Product</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILLBRAE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sculley and Bill Gates, putting
aside for the moment the legal battle between Apple Computer Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., dined peacefully together this week and
announced an ``office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh.
   Gates, chairman of Microsoft, quipped that ``the legal
departments aren't friends.'' But he noted that the two companies
remain steadfast allies and share the same vision of the future of
computing.
   Sculley, Apple's chairman, said his appearance at the Microsoft
presentation on Tuesday ``shows that we want to be partners
together in innovation'' despite Apple's ongoing copyright suit
against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Apple and Microsoft are working together ``more now than at any
time in the past,'' Gates said. ``We have decided not to let (the
lawsuit) affect the other things we're doing and let it run its own
course.''
   Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., recently won a round in the
courtroom fight when a federal judge issued a tentative ruling that
would substantially narrow Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple's suit
accusing Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard of stealing the ``look and
feel'' of the Macintosh system.
   ``Microsoft has always been very clear that we don't understand
why Apple brought the lawsuit, and that we expect to win the
lawsuit,'' Gates said. ``I think the recent developments are
consistent with (our) predictions. The case is not over but it was
a very positive milestone.''
   The ``office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh consists of a
compact disc containing four of Microsoft's most popular business
programs for the Macintosh _ Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and
Mail _ plus documentation for each, a thesaurus and other items.
   Both companies hope the product will help spur the evolution
from floppy diskettes to compact disks for computers.
   The Microsoft Office collection on disk will be priced at $949
and is expected to be available by the end of September. That is a
one-third discount from what the programs would cost if bought
separately on floppy diskettes.
   Sales of Apple's compact disc drive, which retails for about
$1,200, have been slow so far as businesses await more software for
it.
   ``This is just an introductory technology. I don't expect it to
have a major financial impact,'' said analyst David Bayer of
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ``It's more a demonstration
of capabilities, laying the groundwork for future uses.''

FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: Part of the office furniture - Microsoft is
unveiling a new partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine being able to operate all the equipment in your office from one
screen, or each entertainment product in your home from a single remote
control device.
Instead of pressing different buttons on different machines for different
functions, these could all be connected to save users' time, money and the
frustrating need to remember which machine does what and how.
Companies in the electronics, computer, office equipment and entertainment
industries have been thinking along these lines for some time. Now that
wireless communications look like replacing endless lines of cable, such
ideas have been given a new impetus.
Tomorrow, Microsoft, the dominant US software company, will take a
significant step toward the future linking of electronic equipment by
unveiling partnerships with office equipment makers to produce photocopiers,
facsimile machines and laser printers controlled by the company's software.
Microsoft's contribution will be a new office equipment 'operating system'
that will let users control this equipment by merely pointing at pictorial
representations of their functions on a built-in computer screen. The
company has been working on this technology for more than four years and it
is similar to the company's Windows software.
The software operating these new devices will, however, include the ability
to be controlled by Microsoft Windows when connected to a personal computer.
It will also be 'multi-tasking' so that it can allow the office equipment in
question to handle more than one job at once.
One of the partners in this deal - Hewlett-Packard - says it can foresee the
day when this technology will allow it to produce printers with no external
switches, buttons or controls. All of these tasks will be handled by
software and controlled by a PC running Windows. The devices, to be produced
initially under Microsoft's new office equipment partnership, however, will
be capable of operating without a PC connection, although a small, PC-style
flat screen and computer-generated 'icons' will be used to provide the
control. Other partners are Compaq, Ricoh, Minolta, and Ericsson.
These partnerships are only one element in the long-term strategy outlined
by Bill Gates, the head of Microsoft. He wants to put Microsoft technology
in almost anything that uses electricity.
His intention is to make Microsoft software an integral part of office
equipment.
Gates also foresees Microsoft's involvement in the design of specialist
software for 'broadcast' information to and from portable computers over
wireless networks, personal information management applications for use on
hand-held computers, electronic and voice mail from portable systems and the
transfer of data to and from desktop systems automatically.
Finally, he has committed Microsoft to work on designing Windows into
consumer electronic machines such as video cassette recorders, audio
systems, home telephones and information browsing systems run over cable
television networks, as well as advanced computer games, Windows-based
photography systems and multi-media education software.
Gates says many of these projects will require partnerships with companies
in different industries, but Microsoft has enough funds for such strategic
investments. He cites the company's investment last year in London
publishing house Dorling Kindersley and the subsequent development of
multi-media products based around the company's educational books.
'Partnership is the key - getting people to build these devices in an
intelligent form so that other people's machines can talk to their
machines,' says Gates. 'We don't want to dictate partners or form factors -
we are working with dozens of manufacturers to bring out systems that
contain specialised (software) code.'
Gates sees a future where more and more consumer electronics technology is
built around the PC - and that which is not will at least use a form of
Windows as an underlying control technology. He predicts that in the future
many people will have a few wall-mounted colour, flat screens in their house
for TV, video games and information management, with the controls all
condensed onto a single hand-held unit.
In the short term, Gates does not want to let video game manufacturers
maintain 'control of the television' as an interactive entertainment medium
and is investigating the role Microsoft can play here. 'It's a question of
who controls intelligence to TV - which at the moment is Nintendo and Sega,'
he says.
'But what about resolution (sharpness of the TV), what about desire to sit
far away from the device and regulatory issues. These are the kinds of
things Microsoft explores very carefully and we expect to make some bets
here - on telephone control, information browsing and the idea of the PC as
an advanced entertainment machine. This will take some time to shape up and
see exactly what will emerge - but we will be working with lots of partners
on this.'

FT  31 DEC 94 / Engineer of the electronic era: Bill Gates, chairman and
co-founder of Microsoft, is the FT's Man of the Year. He talks to Louise
Kehoe about his vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Microsoft in 1975, their slogan was:
'A personal computer on every desk and in every home.'
At the time, it was an outrageously ambitious proposition, since the
personal computer was little more than a toy for computer hobbyists. Today,
however, that vision is rapidly approaching reality, with more than 45m PCs
sold worldwide this year alone.
The vast majority of those PCs run Microsoft software programs such as the
Windows operating system and applications like Word and Excel, the
spreadsheet. This has made the company - based at Redmond, near Seattle in
the north-west Pacific state of Washington - by far the largest software
publisher in the world, with revenues of Dollars 4.65bn in fiscal 1994.
Microsoft's success has also made Gates the richest person in the US, with
an estimated net worth of more than Dollars 9bn (much of it tied up in
Microsoft shares).
These achievements alone make Gates a man whose every pronouncement is
scrutinised by the computer industry and analysed by investors. But in 1994,
he has added further to his stature, with plans for products that will bring
the information superhighway into every sphere of life.
Microsoft's planned acquisition of Intuit, announced in October, adds
Quicken, the leading PC personal finance program, to the company's software
portfolio. Gates recently unveiled plans to create the Microsoft Network, a
global online service supplying information, bulletin boards, electronic
mail and entertainment to PC users through cable and telephone lines.
The company has also fended off challenges to its business practices -
alleged to have been anti-competitive - from the Federal Trade Commission
and the US Justice Department's antitrust division. A cloud that has hung
over the company's future for four years has been lifted.
But it is as an architect of the next industrial revolution - the
convergence of computer, communications and entertainment technologies -
that we choose Gates as our Man of the Year for 1994. In an end-of-the-year
interview with the Financial Times, he predicts that such technologies will
soon have an impact on every sphere of life - commerce, education,
communication, medicine and entertainment.
Within the next decade, Gates says, information highways will link most
businesses to their customers and suppliers. Wallet or wristwatch PCs will
be able electronically to transfer funds directly to shop cash registers, as
well as store personal identification documents and even family photos.
Doctors will have direct video links to emergency response teams. Teachers
will have access to resources that enable them to bring multimedia lessons
to the classroom. Interactive television services will provide news and
entertainment in the home tailored to the user's personal interests.
'We are investing way, way, way in advance to create the software platforms
and tools for such services,' Gates says. Microsoft has 600 programmers
dedicated to this effort and many more working indirectly on his long-term
goals.
'It is a huge investment and it is based on our belief that these kind of
electronic applications will catch on in a very big way before the end of
the century. Our investment level is predicated on having millions of people
hooked up to broadband (high speed, multimedia) networks within the next
three or four years.'
The pace of computer technology change is accelerating, Gates warns. 'Every
company is going to have to avoid business as usual. The only big companies
that succeed will be those that obsolete their own products before somebody
else does.'
While others in the computer industry may consider Microsoft unassailable,
Gates says he is driven by a 'latent fear' that the company could become
complacent and allow itself to be overtaken by nimbler competitors. It
happened to other large computer companies such as IBM, he points out.
In pursuit of his 'information highway' strategy, Gates is reaching beyond
the computer industry to form partnerships with telephone companies such as
BT and France Telecom, with cable television networks such as
Tele-Communications of the US, and with publishers and Hollywood producers.
A partnership with Visa, the credit card company, could allow secure online
purchasing of goods and services.
Making computers more user-friendly is essential to the proliferation of
information highway services, Gates believes. Microsoft plans to create
easy-to-use, fun 'social interfaces' for the intelligent electronic devices
of the future.
The first product of these efforts will be launched next month. Code-named
'Utopia', it is a first attempt at anthropomorphism in the PC industry, a
program that endows the desktop computer with a 'personality'. Users will
choose one of 10 cartoon-like characters as a friend and helper, guiding
them through tasks, reminding them of things that need to be done and
finding information on other computers via telecom networks.
Gates views the new-found success of the CD-Rom - discs that can store large
amounts of information in the form of text, pictures, music or video - as
the most important development in the PC industry this year. For years,
Microsoft's attempts to interest the PC industry, software publishers and
others in the CD-Rom fell flat. As the publishing medium for computer games,
reference books, shopping catalogues and other PC programs, it is now the
key in creating a new generation of 'multimedia PCs'.
'Really to see that electronic publishing form take off is pretty
fundamental and it carries us into the next phase of computing,' he says.
That next phase is the development of online services. 'People are really
starting to see the PC as a communications tool,' says Gates. 'Look at the
explosion of electronic mail, the Internet and growth in online services.'
He acknowledges that Microsoft Network will face significant competition,
particularly in the US, from existing services such as Compuserve and
America Online. But he seems to relish the battle: the company will create
superior software technology, he claims.
'We have about 50 things that even in the first version will be far better
than the online services have. We will make it very easy for people to do
electronic mail, use bulletin boards, make purchases online . . .
'Even eight or nine months before we get into the business we have had an
impact. Established companies are starting to think: 'Oh, we had better get
more content, do better marketing.' Already we are making the market more
competitive.'
Such boasts give substance to the charge of his critics - and there are many
in the computer industry - that Microsoft effectively dampens competition
with its grandiose 'pre-announcing' of its planned products. Because of the
company's dominance and resources, few software groups can risk a
head-to-head market battle.
This was one of many complaints about Microsoft investigated in the past
four years by the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department's
antitrust division. The investigation ended this year with an agreement, due
to be approved in court next month, involving minor changes to Microsoft's
software licensing practices.
Gates is surprisingly sanguine about the investigation: 'It is to be
expected, when somebody is as successful as we are in an important part of
the economy, that regulators would review the situation to see if it is a
competitive market.'
He complains, nonetheless, that Microsoft is unique in having been
investigated by two government agencies. 'There are not many people who have
had every electronic mail message and everything that they have done
subjected to the kind of scrutiny that we had here.'
The end of the antitrust investigation has not, however, ended the barrage
of criticism and 'Bill bashing' from industry rivals.
One frequent accusation is that Microsoft is not an innovative company.
Rather than inventing new products, it copies the ideas of others, critics
maintain. Windows, Microsoft's PC operating system program, for example, is
still seen by many as an imitation of Apple Computer's Macintosh software.
Most of the criticism is sour grapes, says Richard Shaffer, president of
Technologic, an industry consulting group. 'Like the Japanese computer
companies, Microsoft may not be an inventor, but it perfects products. It is
more important to get the product right, than to be first.'
Getting the product right, however, is proving to be a drawn-out effort for
Windows 95, Microsoft's newest version of Windows. Recently the company
announced that the product will not be available until next August, three
months after its last 'due date' and almost two years after the product was
originally expected.
Gates says the delay is not significant. It is more important, he maintains,
that the product should be compatible with the broad range of PCs and
applications that are currently in use.
Fear of Microsoft's unbounded ambitions and envy of its success are
undoubtedly at the root of much of the criticism that the company receives.
But Gates's personal style does not help. While he can be charming and
friendly on a good day, he can be testy and abrasive, even in front of TV
cameras. At industry gatherings, he often seems condescending, dismissing
any challenge to his ideas. In company meetings, he is prone to outbursts.
'That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard' is a typical Gates line.
'Part of Bill's style of presenting, clarifying and challenging ideas is to
be very blunt and a little bit dramatic and some would say a little rude,'
says Steve Balmer, Microsoft executive vice-president, one of Gates's
closest friends for 20 years. 'But he is a lot less rude than he was 10
years ago]'
Apart from a Porsche sports car and a Dollars 35m mansion under construction
on the outskirts of Seattle, Gates is not conspicuous in spending his
wealth. One exception was his purchase in November of an illustrated
manuscript by Leonardo Da Vinci for Dollars 30.8m.
He likes to keep his private life private. Newly wed to Melinda French, a
Microsoft product manager, Gates bristles at any mention of his personal
life, which he does not consider a matter of public interest.
Said by some to be the computer industry's answer to Henry Ford, and by
others to be the most powerful US businessman since Rockefeller, Bill Gates,
at 39, still has plenty of time to outdo both.

software companies that it "has monopolized or has attempted to monopolize the
market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software and
computer peripherals" -- in other words, its entire product line.;    IBM is
not believed to be a subject of the investigation.;    Microsoft maintains it
has done nothing wrong and said the personal computer industry teems with
competition.;    "Microsoft is surprised and disappointed that the inquiry has
been broadened," said William H. Neukom, vice president of law and corporate
affairs. "We will continue to cooperate with this investigation. We believe
that Microsoft has acted in a legal and ethical manner.";    The news of the
expansion of the FTC probe did only minimal harm to Microsoft's soaring stock,
which has made Chairman Bill Gates a multibillionaire and one of the nation's
wealthiest men. The stock fell $3.75 a share to $107.25 in Over-the-Counter
trading.;    Microsoft has a near-monopoly on operating systems for IBM
personal computers, is a leading supplier of software for the Apple Macintosh,
and is moving aggressively in computing areas expected to boom in the next 10
years, such as powerful desk-top "work stations" and new computers that use
pens instead of keyboards.;    The FTC probe could lead to a change in
Microsoft's business practices. But it's also of grave concern to other
companies, because firms throughout the personal computer industry must build
some guess about Microsoft's actions into their own business plans.;    And
the mere existence of an expanded inquiry might have a chilling effect on
Microsoft, making it more timid and its rivals more bold.;    In recent years,
industry executives have complained with increasing anger -- though usually
only in private -- that Microsoft goes beyond being a heads-up competitor and
instead uses its dominant market position in a manner that is at least unfair
and possibly illegal.;    One industry executive questioned by the FTC, who
spoke on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified, said the
FTC began its probe last fall with a limited set of questions but greatly
expanded the investigation's scope after hearing one industry executive after
another bitterly complain about Microsoft's practices.;    About 15 software
companies are believed to have been questioned, and the executive said the
commission has a much longer list it now wants to pursue in this new stage of
its inquiries.;    "The FTC is surprisingly knowledgeable," he said. "They are
interested in the full context of Microsoft's impact on the industry.";    The
executive said that Wordperfect Corp., the Utah word-processing software
company, took a lead role in lodging complaints against Microsoft.;   
Microsoft sells Word, a word-processing program that competes against
Wordperfect's product. The executive said Microsoft uses its profits from its
operating system division to undercut companies like Wordperfect on the
applications side.;    Others have also complained about Microsoft's pricing
policies or about it once persuading software companies to spend tens of
millions of dollars developing products for one operating system, only to
switch to another at the last minute.;    Many companies are rankled by what
they see as Microsoft's arrogance.;    "Microsoft is like a 6-(foot)-4
17-year-old boy. It lacks the inhibitions of a mature adult," said Bob
Metcalfe, who founded 3Com Corp. and who later had a well-publicized
falling-out with Microsoft. "It's a billion-dollar company that has not
developed the inhibitions befitting a company of its size. It needs to be
taught a lesson, like IBM was taught in the '50s and '60s, that when you have
a huge monopoly, you have to behave differently.";    Any FTC action against
Microsoft might be years away; its probes are notoriously lengthy affairs. The
FTC will not discuss the investigation and certainly not what action, if any,
it may take.;    Federal antitrust laws are exceedingly complex but generally
bar companies from engaging in practices that lessen competition or harm
consumers.;    The FTC has only civil powers and can go to court to force a
company to change objectionable practices. Only the Justice Department, with
which the FTC works closely, can bring criminal charges.  </TEXT>

Valley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
ACCIDENTAL EMPIRES by Robert X CringelyViking Pounds 16.99, 324 pages
ROBERT CRINGELY has heroes, villains and sweeping conclusions, appropriately
enough for the gossip columnist of a US trade magazine. Accidental Empires,
his idiosyncratic history of the US personal computer business, includes a
good measure of all three: it is subtitled How the boys of Silicon Valley
make their millions, battle foreign competition and still can't get a date.
His heroes are too honest for their own good. Mitchell Kapor, for example,
is founder of Lotus Development Corporation, and designer of 1-2-3, the
world's best-selling spreadsheet. A former disc jockey and transcendental
meditation teacher, the success of 1-2-3 left him fabulously wealthy and,
Cringely says, needlessly guilt-ridden: 'I think Mitch Kapor isn't happy
because he feels like an imposter . . . Imposters are people who feel they
haven't earned their success, haven't paid their dues - that it was all too
easy'.
Kapor spotted and exploited a unique opportunity. In the early 1980s he
believed that there would be a ready market for a good spreadsheet program
suitable for the newly launched IBM PC, and planned on selling Dollars 4m
worth of 1-2-3 in the first year. Sales in fact topped Dollars 53m (Pounds
30.9m) and Lotus grew to be one of the world's largest software houses.
Kapor found running a business less fun than starting one and left in 1986.
Cringely's villains start black and he paints them blacker. Bill Gates,
founder and chief executive of the US software company Microsoft, is his
principal target. Credited with a personal fortune of more than Dollars 7bn,
Gates is one of the richest people in the US but, most would agree, hard to
like. He is arrogant, charmless and possessed of an outsize business
aggression which has driven Microsoft to annual sales of more than Dollars
2.5bn but won him few friends on the way.
But this is merely the point at which Cringely begins to turn the knife. We
learn of Gates' scruffy personal habits, his meanness, his infantile
behaviour and so on and so forth. What did Gates ever do to Cringeley to
merit such treatment?
Here is his analysis of the origin of the personal computer business: 'The
game was started to satisfy the needs of disenfranchised nerds like Bill
Gates who didn't meet the macho standards of American maleness and so looked
for a way to create their own adolescent alternative to the adult world and,
through that creation, gain the admiration of their peers'.
Heroes and villains apart, Cringely's major conclusion is that US
manufacturers should forget the personal computer hardware business. Profit
margins are narrowing, other nations are catching up in the technology
stakes and the entrepreneurs and technical wizards who made the whole thing
happen are tiring of the struggle:
'Today, everyone who wants to be in the pc business is already in it . . .
The business is slowing down and this loss of energy is the greatest threat
to our computing future as a nation. Forget about the Japanese; their threat
is nothing compared to this loss of intellectual vigour,' Cringeley argues.
He believes the US should concentrate on the two remaining growth areas  -
microprocessors and software - where he thinks America still has a
technological lead. But his case is spoilt by the fact that much of this
book is filled with anecdotal evidence of amateurishness, greed and lack of
attention to quality which, he implies, permeates the US personal computer
industry.
The Japanese are already making startling progress in software. On this
evidence they will win hands-down on quality.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Technology: Microsoft's next big update - How the software
maker has responded to customer comments and complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, is set to unveil
plans for the next generation of its hugely popular Windows personal
computer software in Atlanta, Georgia, next week.
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, plans to demonstrate Windows 4.0 -
codenamed Chicago - to the public for the first time and detail plans for
its release.
Chicago is a big advance on the best-selling computer operating system
combination ever - Microsoft's MS-Dos and Windows software. Gates predicts
huge sales for Chicago next year. He hopes a 'significant proportion' of the
60m users of Windows will upgrade to the new software. In addition, most PC
manufacturers are expected to install the new version of Windows on PCs
shipped after the official launch. The date for that is yet to be fixed. But
the company expects the product to be available this year.
'Chicago will be the most popular systems (software) update we have ever put
out,' says Gates, who comments that he will be disappointed if Chicago does
not generate at least Dollars 500m in sales during its first year on the
market.
The Chicago upgrade package for existing Windows users is expected to sell
for between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100.
Microsoft suggests several reasons for PC users to buy the upgrade:
With the introduction of Chicago, Microsoft will merge its two top selling
products, MS-Dos and Windows, into a single PC operating system, providing a
better way to harness the power of the latest, high-speed PC
microprocessors.
Chicago, it claims, will also make PCs much easier to use than either Apple
Computer's Macintosh or PCs running existing versions of Windows.
The new program will make it easier to hook PCs up to a network.
Extensive testing of Chicago indicated to Microsoft that Windows users were
often befuddled by crowded, confusing screens and inconsistent commands. So
Chicago will look quite different from the existing Windows product. For
example, Microsoft found that the Windows Program Manager, File Manager,
Windows Setup and Control Panel systems were often confusing to users who
did not know where to start when they needed to make changes to the system,
by adding hardware or software. These elements have been made simpler and
more consistent in Chicago, so that adding a new printer or changing the
resolution on screen is much easier.
Microsoft has also made major improvements to the basic applications
incorporated in Windows, including word-processing, communications and
personal information management programs.
Yet despite these new elements, Microsoft faces some significant challenges
if Chicago is to live up to expectations. To start with, the new look means
many users may need retraining to take full advantage of its capabilities.
Some PCs used by companies or individuals do not have enough memory or
processing power to run Chicago. So corporate PC buyers face the choice of
upgrading all their PCs or supporting two generations of PC operating
systems.
Yet for new PC users and users of recently purchased PCs, Chicago represents
a breakthrough in performance and ease of use. With this new version of
Windows, Microsoft appears set to maintain its tight grip on the market.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Microsoft polishes its 'Windows'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of enhancements to 'Windows', Microsoft's best-selling PC operating
environment, are on the horizon.
The next technology will be Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Version 2 -
which will be shipped in the coming months as part of products such as
Microsoft Publisher.
The idea behind OLE is that all types of information can be treated as
'objects' that can be copied, moved or manipulated within any Windows
application program. Object types include text, graphics, animation
sequences, short film clips, voice messages and spreadsheet models.
OLE will provide flexibility to PC users who are familiar with the options
on all of the applications programs at their disposal. Yet it threatens to
plunge less-experienced users into unfamiliar territory without obvious
means of escape, creating potential support problems.
Merging MS-Dos and Windows as a single PC operating system will result in a
program called Chicago. It will feature 'pre-emptive multitasking' meaning
that several functions can be carried out simultaneously.
Microsoft is pinning a great deal of hope on Chicago, which is scheduled for
introduction in about 12 months. 'Chicago will be the most popular systems
update we have ever put out,' Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, said.
By the time Chicago is shipped, Microsoft expects that there will be 50m
copies of Windows sold - and Gates says that if Chicago does not generate at
least Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) in sales during its first year he will be
disappointed.
Due in about 18 months, Cairo is the ultimate version of Windows. It will
'learn' how each user works, enabling them to customise the way they
organise and find information on their computer.

So Bill Gates, Wunderkind entrepreneur, co-founder of Microsoft and the
richest man in the US, is not invincible after all. His well-flagged book on
the future of the information highway, titled The Road Ahead, has taken a
wrong turn on the way to publication.
Viking, which is thought to have paid an advance of more than Dollars 2.5m
for the rights to publish Gates's musings, now says that the book's release
has been postponed - from November to next March.
Also delayed - again - is the launch of Microsoft's next version of Windows
PC software, which was originally scheduled for release in 1993 and is not
now expected until May or June 1995. Could the latter have proved something
of a distraction for the first-time author?

<HEAD>Microsoft To Invest Heavily, Add 2,400 Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp., riding a ``red hot'' hit
with its Windows 3.0 software, plans to invest millions of dollars
on new products and services and add more than 2,300 employees in
the next year, its executives say.
   Corporate officials also told financial analysts gathered at
Microsoft's headquarters Thursday that because of the spending, it
would be difficult to maintain the hectic pace of sales growth the
company has enjoyed.
   Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates said the new version
of Windows ``is the center of the universe for us now.'' The
program, which provides an easy-to-use framework for running
spreadsheets, word processors and other programs, will be further
improved this year and have more programs adapted to it, he said.
   Gates also said Microsoft was beginning a major move into office
computer networks and hoped to capture a share of that market now
dominated by Novell Inc. of Orem, Utah.
   Microsoft, the world's largest publisher of personal computer
software, reported Wednesday its profits for the fiscal year ended
June 30 grew 64 percent over the year before, while revenues rose
47 percent.
   ``We're extremely bullish on the markets we participate in from
a long-term standpoint,'' said Microsoft president Mike Hallman,
but added that projects would require ``some heavy investments this
year.''
   Asked whether Microsoft could sustain the 47 percent sales
growth, senior vice president and chief financial officer Frank
Gaudette replied, ``I think that would be on the very high end.''
   Microsoft's stock, which closed up $2 at $71.50 a share
Wednesday in over-the-counter trading, fell $2.75 a share to $68.75
Thursday.
   Neither Hallman nor Gates would say how much investment would be
required. But Steve Ballmer, senior vice president for systems
software, said his segment alone would spend $18 million and hire
500 more people to work on its new ``Network Specialist Program.''
   Microsoft spent $180 million on research and development and
$317 million on sales and marketing in fiscal 1990.
   Microsoft plans to grow from its present 5,635 employees to
about 8,000 over the next year. Hallman said the new workers would
include 750 in research and development and 1,250 in sales and
marketing.
   Microsoft, founded by the multibillionaire Gates and prep school
friend Paul Allen 15 years ago, had just 1,800 employees in 1987.
   It reported fiscal 1990 profits of $279.2 million or $2.34 a
share on revenues of $1.18 billion, both records. Net earnings for
fiscal 1989 were $170.5 million or $41.52 a share on revenues of
$803.5 million.
   Sales and profits were boosted by Windows 3.0, a runaway success
with 800,000 copies shipped since its introduction in late May,
Ballmer said. The software replaces the technical word commands
needed to manage programs and information in IBM personal computers
with on-screen graphics.
   ``It is absolutely red hot,'' Ballmer said.
   Microsoft shipped just 200,000 copies of its advanced computer
operating system OS-2 in all of fiscal 1990, Ballmer said.
   At one time, OS-2 was seen as the replacement for MS-DOS,
Microsoft's operating system that is the industry standard for
IBM-compatible computers. But with the huge success of Windows,
Microsoft now sees itself as having a ``family'' of operating
systems, with OS-2 an ``advanced form of Windows,'' Gates said.
   ``DOS is not likely to be replaced in the foreseeable future,''
Ballmer said.
   In the 1990s, Microsoft will evangelize for office and corporate
networks linking large computers and desktop computer users to
permit instant access to vast amounts of information, Ballmer said.
   To do that, Microsoft will introduce a new version of its Local
Area Network Manager software in August, is setting up a specially
trained group of resellers, and is boosting its sales and support
force, he said. It plans a major ad campaign and a series of
seminars this fall and winter to launch the Network Specialist
Program, he added.
   The target is Novell, which has 65 percent or better of the
existing office network market. Novell, founded in 1983 and the
maker of the NetWare operating system, had sales of $225.9 million
in the six months ended April 28.
   Capturing market share from Novell won't happen soon, Ballmer
said. ``We cannot overwhelm them. We have to show cleverness,'' he
said.
   Gates said he didn't see the move as dramatic or dangerous, but
necessary, since he believes networks will eventually dominate
office computing.
   A Novell official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
move by Microsoft had been expected for some time. By educating
more potential customers, Microsoft's heavy promotion of office
networks should benefit the industry as a whole, Novell included,
the official said.

<LEADPARA>  Candor has its price, and for Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, it's
apparently $320 million.;    That was the amount that Gates' "paper fortune"
shrank Wednesday as the result of a 7 percent decline in Microsoft's stock
blamed on Wall Street reaction to Gates' memo on the numerous challenges
facing his company.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CANDID MEMO COSTS MICROSOFT'S GATES A FORTUNE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gates' six-page lament, originally intended for the Redmond, Wash.,
software supplier's senior staff but later leaked, told how Microsoft has
cultivated an opponent rather than an ally in IBM; how Microsoft has made no
inroads in the fast-growing networking marketplace; and how it stands to lose
sales to leaner competitors, such as Borland International Inc. of Scotts
Valley.;    Gates has a reputation as a competitor-obsessed worrier to begin
with -- and the memo ends on an upbeat note, with Gates trumpeting his
strategy to make the Windows control program an even bigger success. But
Microsoft shares nonetheless fell $8.13 to close at $103.38 in trading that
was more than double normal levels. Gates owns about a third of the 115
million outstanding shares of Microsoft stock.;    Previously trading at about
30 times earnings, Microsoft has long been one of Wall Street's pricier
stocks. Analysts said that by concentrating in a single document so much bad
news about Microsoft, the memo brought to the surface a lingering investor
concern that Microsoft might be overvalued.;    "The market is pricing a new
risk into the Microsoft story," said David Readerman, analyst at Shearson
Lehman in San Francisco.;    Despite the dramatic drop in the stock price,
Gates -- who was traveling in Europe on Wednesday -- should not despair, as
there is life after a self-critical memo.;    Ask Autodesk Inc., the Sausalito
design software company whose stock is close to its 52-week high despite a
blistering 44-page memo by founder John Walker released 2 1/2 months ago -- a
document Gates cited as inspiration for his own.;    Walker called his memo
"The Final Days" and compared Autodesk to NASA before the explosion of the
space shuttle.;    "I am deeply concerned about the future of the company,"
Walker wrote. "Autodesk possesses all the prerequisites to lead the next
generation of the PC industry, yet it seems to have become stuck in the past,
mired in bureaucracy, paralyzed by unwarranted caution and to have lost the
edge of rapid and responsive product development and aggressive marketing and
promotion on which the success of Autocad (its key product) was founded.";   
Walker, who retired from all formal management tasks at the firm three years
ago but who still owns 4 percent of its stock, went on to make a number of
specific recommendations for the company, some of which have been implemented.
Others will be enacted in a reorganization planned for July 1, a spokesman
said.;    This spate of high-level soul-searching by leading industry
executives has led some Silicon Valley managers to wonder if they weren't
missing some important rite of corporate passage by not setting pen to paper
about their own internal problems.;    "I started thinking, 'Gee, I better
write a memo about our company,' " cracked Brad Bishop, chairman of Avcom, a
Palo Alto firm that sells work stations.;    Walker's memo is in a long
tradition of public self-criticism at Autodesk; it was given out freely to the
firm's 1,100 employees, and a dozen previous efforts have been published in a
book.;    Discussing the chance of a memo being given to a competitor or
reporter, the memo called such risks "unavoidable consequences of placing the
issues on Autodesk's agenda," especially since management had previously not
heeded private warnings. "If Autodesk doesn't remedy these shortcomings, they
will soon be sufficiently obvious that competitors won't need me to point them
out."  </TEXT>

investment firm, Microsoft stock climbed more than $5 a share Wednesday,
passing its 52-week high of $102. Shares fell $2.75 on Thursday to close at

<HEADLINE>  GATES' NET WORTH SOARS INTO BOLIVIA'S NEIGHBORHOOD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At most recent count, Gates owned more than 40 million shares of Microsoft.
Based on figures in the Oct. 22 issue of Forbes magazine's "400 Richest" list,
Gates would trail only Metromedia magnate John Werner Kluge, whose estimated
worth was $5.6 billion.;    Put in other terms, Gates' fortune rivals the
gross national products of Bolivia and Afghanistan. An average American wage
earner would have to work 100,000 to 150,000 years to equal the amount. Gates
was traveling out of the country and not available for comment, but Microsoft
insiders say he downplays discussions of wealth and does not follow the stock
price. Ironically, he is not Microsoft's highest-paid employee, earning
$261,000 a year compared with President Michael Hallman's $1.7 million
salary.;    The buying frenzy took hold after Goldman Sachs investment analyst
Rick Sherlund said he believed Microsoft will announce next week it is
entering a new market -- the development of software for computers based on a
chip from Mips Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale. The chips (known as RISC,
or reduced instruction-set computing) are used in powerful corporate,
scientific and engineering computers and networks.  </TEXT>

Microsoft chairman and co-founder Bill Gates is careful to whom he gives his
home telephone number, but John Seabrook, interviewing Gates in the latest
Esquire magazine, tells us the nerdish-looking multi-billionaire is more
than happy to communicate via e-mail.
Seabrook struck up a matey electronic relationship with 'Billg', quickly
learning to copy the maestro by dispensing with formalities such as Dear and
Yours.
Gates apparently spends two hours a day reading and writing e-mail. While
Gates gives little away - 'having lots of money is a corrupting thing' gives
a flavour - former girl friends recall his apparent indifference to personal
hygiene and his spectacles being so grimy as to be ineffective. Gates says
he invariably runs a comb through his hair before dispatching e-mail -
'hoping to appear attractive'. Most odd.

   Walter ``Skeet'' Rogers put on metal
gloves, grabbed a 3-foot-long alligator and slung it into a cotton
wagon, moving it to high ground before flood waters got it.
   ``The last time we got to fooling with them, one man got 47
stitches,'' Rogers said, explaining the gloves.
   Rogers' 4,000 alligators were hatched from eggs gathered from
wild nests and raised in double-decked ponds in four
climate-controlled cinder-block buildings. Two more buildings are
under construction at his Bayou Pierre Gator Farm, located on low
land near the bayou for which it is named.
   About 200 square miles of Louisiana is flooded by water from the
Red River and backwaters such as Bayou Pierre. Most of the land in
a sparsely settled section of the state is for farming cotton,
wheat, soybeans.
   Rogers' crop is different, though no less threatened.
   ``It's awful. The water keeps coming up,'' said Alice Hart,
Rogers' mother. ``I've been right here for 12 years, and nothing
like this has ever happened before.
   ``They'll drown. Skeet sold off some of the big ones, but the
rest will just drown, if it keeps coming up.''
   With hides bringing $35 a linear foot and demand for alligator
meat high, alligator farming is a burgeoning industry in an
economically depressed state. Louisiana has 92 licensed gator
farms. Two-dozen license applications are pending. Three years ago,
there were 13 alligator farms in Louisiana.
   Buddy Goatcher, an alligator biologist with the state Department
of Wildlife and Fisheries, said it is possible gators could be
drowned if trapped in deep water for a long time with no firm
resting place.
   ``The farmer can't predict how long the waters will be up,''
Goatcher said. ``And you can't predict the force of the water. It
could knock down the building and send gators spewing all over the
place.''
   ``The threat is not so much to the well-being of the gators.
They'd love it,'' he said. ``The threat is losing the farm.''
   Along with the buildings and the concrete ponds, special heaters
are necessary to keep it warm enough for a good hatching rate and
optimum growth.
   ``He doesn't want a lot of cold water coming in,'' Goatcher said.
   Rogers and two helpers, Roy Cheatwood and his son, Roy Jr.,
piled homemade sandbags around pumps, heaters and other immovable
equipment, trying to protect them from the flood.
   The alligators were packed into four cotton wagons parked on a
nearby mound.
   Each gator had to be moved by hand.
   ``We can't get behind them with horses and drive them to high
ground,'' Rogers said.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Man in the News: Hard wear for a software warrior - Ray
Noorda / Louise Kehoe and Geof Wheelwright on the 'Mr Nice Guy' who has
taken on Bill Gates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray Noorda, 69, looks like everyone's favourite grandad. The chairman and
chief executive of Novell, the world's second-largest personal computer
software company - after its arch-rival Microsoft - drives a pick-up truck
to work in Provo, Utah, and decorates his offices with folksy Norman
Rockwell prints inscribed with uplifting mottoes.
A more unlikely adversary of Bill Gates, the testy, boyish multi-billionaire
chairman of Microsoft is hard to imagine. Yet 'Mr Nice Guy' Noorda, has
shown that beneath the amiable exterior lies a determination to influence
the direction of the computer industry. And that means putting Gates in his
place.
This week, it emerged that Novell has filed an anti-trust complaint against
Microsoft with European Community competition authorities. Novell has also
played an active role, behind the scenes, in providing information to US
authorities, leading to a justice department anti-trust probe of Microsoft.
Clearly rattled, Gates has lashed out at Noorda. 'He has a tremendous
vendetta against us. Novell has made a conscious decision to spread lies
about us,' he has charged.
Responding calmly, Noorda says: 'We have felt that Microsoft has broken
certain principles or codes of doing business. Wherever we see unfair
practices . . . particularly if we feel they are injurious to the industry
at large, we will probably complain to the recognised authorities.'
Noorda defers to his lawyers on details of the complaint to the EC, which
alleges Microsoft has abused its dominant market position in personal
computer operating systems to restrict competition.
He is, however, forthright on the principle involved. 'Competition is
absolutely necessary for anybody to improve what they are doing. So it
wouldn't be good either for Microsoft or for the industry if they were to
achieve a monopoly.'
Gates 'is not a bad guy, he is a young guy,' Noorda adds. 'In my more than
40 years in the industry I have not met a bunch like them. They are
possessive, aggressive and strong challengers, but they are afraid of
head-on competition and that is anathema to me.'
Noorda's outlook has been shaped by attempts to compete with Microsoft in
the market for PC operating systems. Novell charges that Microsoft protects
its share of this segment of the software business - more than 90 per cent -
through restrictive licensing schemes.
Adding fuel to perceptions of uncompetitive trading is the abortive merger
plan between the two companies, initiated by Gates last year, which was
called off when Microsoft acquired another software company without telling
Novell. Noorda says: 'I don't know what their motives were. I can only
speculate. But perhaps they were trying to slow us down.'
Noorda warns that computer users do not benefit if one company - be it
Microsoft or IBM - becomes so dominant that it can dictate 'how the game is
played'.
During a career which began in the era of punch cards, Noorda believes the
most significant technological change has been the emergence of the
'networking environment' in which different types of computer are linked
throughout an organisation, sharing information and processing tasks.
'Today, the customers demand that everything has to work together,' Noorda
says. 'That means that everyone in the computer industry has to work
together. We have tried to make a successful business out of working with
companies who would otherwise be called our competitors.'
Noorda has coined the word 'co-opetition' to describe the complex
relationships which can bring competitors to share, for example, technical
details of forthcoming products to ensure that they work together. 'We feel
that he who will co-operate the most with competitors will be the
longer-term survivor,' Noorda says.
This does not mean Noorda is a push over. Indeed, Novell is one of the few
companies in the software industry that has gone head to head with Microsoft
and won.
Since he acquired Novell 10 years ago, Noorda has transformed what was a
failing computer company into the leading supplier of software for personal
computer networks, with more than 70 per cent of the world market. Turnover
has increased from Dollars 3.8m in 1983 to Dollars 933m for its fiscal year
ended October 31 1992.
In the process, Noorda, with about 11 per cent of Novell's stock, has become
a billionaire. But money does not seem to excite him. Until last year he
drew a modest salary of Dollars 38,000 a year, preferring, he said, to spend
money on hiring. The board of directors forced him to raise his salary to
Dollars 198,000 after Wall Street observers suggested his commitment to the
company might appear to be in doubt.
Since he took over at Novell, Noorda has acquired 15 smaller companies,
expanding Novell's technology base and demonstrating a rare ability
successfully to manage mergers. The largest acquisition, completed in June,
with the Dollars 322m purchase of Unix System Laboratories, a former AT&amp;T
subsidiary, may stretch those skills. Assimilating USL's employees is a
challenge, Noorda concedes. The recent departure of Roel Pieper, former
president and chief executive of USL and a respected industry executive, for
'personal reasons', hints at how difficult the adjustment may be.
The purchase of USL will also test Noorda's 'co-opetition' philosophy.
Novell now controls Unix, the widely used computer operating system. This
makes Noorda the referee in an industry-wide feud over competing versions of
the program. The acquisition also places Novell in head-to-head competition
with Microsoft's latest Windows NT, an advanced computer operating system
that represents Microsoft's bid to expand beyond PCs.
As Novell and Microsoft's ambitions increasingly overlap, the potential for
conflict increases. Yet Noorda insists he is not aiming to depose Microsoft
as the industry leader. 'Our motivation is not to own the industry, not to
be the biggest company necessarily, but to accelerate the growth of the
industry,' he says. 'That is our best chance for survival in this intensely
competitive business.'
It is this competitive challenge that seems to motivate Noorda. He has no
plans to retire, he says, although he plans to name his successor at Novell
later this year. 'I'll expire before I retire,' he quips. 'I hope to
continue to be involved with Novell for a long time.' And for that long
Microsoft is likely to feel the heat.

<HEAD>Second Season Set to Begin Under Revised Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEWISTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alligator hunters are poised to fan out
over lakes and canals for the start of the state's second gator
season in a quarter-century, and hide and meat processors won't be
far behind.
   Under new rules, the 221 licensed hunters must kill alligators
immediately by harpoon or bang-stick, a hand-held device that shoots
a .22-caliber cartridge on impact.
   Last year, most of the 2,979 gators bagged were captured and
brought to processors alive. Several airboats were capsized but no
serious injuries were reported in the hunt, the state's first in 26
years.
   Dead gators must be skinned within four hours to keep the meat
from spoiling, so hide and meat processors have made arrangements to
get the fresh meat in cold storage quickly.
   ``The industry has addressed the needs and is taking whatever
actions are necessary to ensure that the quality of the meat is
preserved,'' said Dennis David, coordinator of state alligator
programs. ``Many of them were making arrangements to have ice trucks
and refrigerated trucks and large coolers to purchase carcasses at
the lake shore.''
   Wildlife officials say the state's population of about 1 million
alligators won't be hurt by the monthlong hunt, beginning a
half-hour before sunset today.
   A study of Lake Okeechobee gators indicates the hunt actually may
improve the health of the general population by reducing the number
of reptiles competing for survival, David said.
   The state revived the hunt last year to help trim the gator
population, which has doubled since stringent anti-poaching measures
were adopted in 1970.
   Okeechobee, one of 32 bodies of water open to the hunters, is
drawing particular attention following reported sightings of an
18-foot alligator east of Clewiston on the lake's southwest shore.
   Yet, some feel it's mostly a tall tale.
   ``It's probably 90 percents rumor,'' said Charles Lawhon of Moore
Haven. ``If it's there, it's a well-smart alligator and it keeps
well hidden.''
   Hunters can earn about $500 for the skin and meat of a 4-foot
gator, and prices for large bulls can reach $1,000. The biggest
gator bagged last year stretched 13 feet, 4 inches.
   Parts of the Everglades in western Dade and Broward counties will
be off-limits, despite above-average alligator populations, because
of excessive mercury levels.
   The state selected 229 names at random from among 20,163
applicants for hunting licenses. All but eight attended a six-hour
training session and paid a $250 fee for the right to kill 15 gators
each, David said.
   David expects this year's catch to be about 2,900 again.

When Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates talks, the personal computer industry 
listens -- even if the message is a little bit vague. That was certainly the 
case Monday, at least, as Gates gave the keynote address at the huge Comdex 
trade show here to an overflow crowd of computer dealers, equipment vendors and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The vision he presented was certainly an appealing one -- a computing world 
where a standard desktop machine will give access to a broad range of text, 
voice and video information at the simple touch of a mouse. The barriers 
between different software programs -- word processing and spreadsheets, for 
example -- would disappear, allowing people to move seamlessly from one type of 
computer application to another. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it would be possible to search a central database for, say, a chart that 
someone else at the company had created, attach that to an electronic mail 
message, stick a video picture into that same message, make a few voice 
annotations, and then send it off -- all with just a few clicks of the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
Gates calls his concept "Information at Your Fingertips" and considers it the 
key to dramatically expanding the base of personal computer customers at a time 
when PC industry growth has all but stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, however, specifically avoided discussing what products might make his 
concept a reality. 
</P>
<P>
However Gates' vision is ultimately implemented, Microsoft is well positioned 
to maintain its monopoly on the software that controls the basic functions of a 
personal computer. It's certainly more secure than the other big PC monopoly: 
Intel Corp.'s chokehold on the supply of the microprocessors that provide the 
basic brains of a PC. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices on Monday gave the first public demonstration of its 
long-awaited "clone" of Intel's hot-selling 386 microprocessor. The AMD chip -- 
called the AM386 since last Friday, when a court denied an Intel request to bar 
AMD from using that name -- was shown running on off-the-shelf computers from 
Compaq Computer and International Business Machines. Mike Webb, head of 
marketing for the product, said AMD's own tests and those of the 20 PC makers 
who have samples showed it to be completely compatible with Intel's version. 
</P>
<P>
By all appearances, AMD is ready to begin selling its three versions of the 
386, including a low-power model aimed at portable PCs. But Intel has been 
fighting tooth and nail in the courts, and AMD's efforts could still be at 
least partially thwarted by several pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Though AMD officials deny it, the continuing shadow of the Intel lawsuits might 
explain why the company won't discuss when the product will be released, or how 
much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
What are customers supposed to do with old equipment when they invest in fancy 
new stuff? The unceremonious answer has long been "throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
But Alex Randall, co-founder of the Boston Computer Exchange, has been bucking 
this reality for a while. He announced at Comdex what is believed to be the 
first national dealer program for used PC trade-ins. About 275 Valcom computer 
stores nationwide will now accept trade-ins from customers buying new machines, 
with prices based on the Boston Computer Exchanges' widely used valuations. 
</P>
<P>
An IBM AT that might have cost $2,000 new in 1988 is now worth $650 on a 
trade-in, for example. The Boston Computer Exchange then sells the machines, 
many in overseas markets such as Eastern Europe that are technology-hungry but 
cash-poor. A lot of computer dealers don't like the trade-in concept -- lots of 
trouble, not much profit -- but Randall says more dealers will be signing on 
soon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has appointed Mr
Robert Herbold, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, as executive
vice-president and chief operating officer, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Mr Herbold will report directly to Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and
chief executive, as a member of Microsoft's 'office of the president',
succeeding the late Mr Frank Gaudette, who died in April.
He joins Mr Steve Ballmer, executive vice-president of sales and support,
and Mr Mike Maples, executive vice-president of products, as a member of the
office. This group shares responsibility with Mr Gates for broad strategic
and business planning for the entire company.
Mr Herbold worked for P&amp;G for 26 years, most recently as senior
vice-president for information services and advertising.
The appointment by Microsoft of an outsider to such a senior position is
surprising. In the past Mr Gates has expressed scepticism about the choice
of executives from other industries such as Mr Lou Gerstner of IBM to head
computer companies.
Yesterday, however, Mr Gates said that Mr Herbold's business experience and
management skills 'will prove invaluable in taking Microsoft forward as we
face new business challenges'.
Mr Herbold will be responsible for worldwide operations at Microsoft,
including finance, manufacturing, distribution, logistics, information
technology, human resources, corporate services, real estate and development
and Microsoft Press.

   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates unveiled
his grand vision of the future of personal computing Monday, an era
in which desktop and handheld machines will provide a window to
vast amounts of information.
   In the keynote address at the giant Comdex computer show, Gates
described a future in which computers are much more useful and
easier to use.
   Gates, whose company developed the most widely used operating
system for personal computers, outlined new technologies that will
bring video, voice and handwriting recognition capabilities to
personal computers.
   ``This is a formidable challenge. No single company is going to
be able to do this,'' he said.
   Gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and
software companies to bring about his vision, which he calls
``information at your fingertips.''
   In an amusing series of videos on a giant screen, Gates depicted
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in
the mythical town of Twin Points, a spoof of the TV series ``Twin
Peaks.''
   In one example, he showed how a deliveryman for Twin Points
Bakery would use a book-sized handheld computer that recognized
handwriting to enter orders at a grocery store.
   Using a special pen, or stylus, the deliveryman wrote in the
orders for various items on the computer screen. The computer
verified the order by printing the quantity.
   When the grocer balked at ordering a certain amount of one item,
the deliveryman used the screen to display a bar chart showing how
much of that item sold at the store in a certain period.
   When the grocer also ordered a new display rack, the computer
flashed a warning that he was over his credit limit with the
bakery.
   But through a cellular phone device inside the machine, the
computer contacted a central computer at the bakery, which then
authorized the display rack but required the grocer to ``sign'' for
it on the handheld computer screen, using the stylus.
   In another video, Gates showed how a student using a
computerized encyclopedia could do a report on the state of
Washington, where Microsoft is based.
   A ``page'' of the encyclopedia depicting facts about Washington
showed a picture of the state bird. Beside the bird was a small
picture, called an icon, of several musical notes. When the student
moved an on-screen arrow to the icon, and then pushed a button on a
device called a mouse, the computer played a short audio passage of
the bird's song stored in its memory.
   The encyclopedia also gave a chart of the state's leading
industries, software among them. When the arrow was placed on
``Microsoft,'' a small picture of the company's offices came on the
screen. When the arrow was moved to the picture and the mouse
button pushed, the computer played a video of several of the
company's employees.
   Gates also showed a video of a couple designing a house. When
they wanted to visualize various layouts, their architect allowed
them to ``walk through'' a three-dimensional model of their
proposed home on a computer screen. The couple also could see on
the screen how various color schemes would look, and when they
wanted to look at appliances, the architect called up a video
advertisement from an oven manufacturer.
   Gates, 35, said these new technologies are not some science
fiction dream, but are under development or already in use. In
fact, such combinations of text, graphics, sound and videos -
called multimedia computing - are among the hot topics at this
year's Comdex.
   One of the keys to Gates' vision is tying together the
technologies of handwriting recognition, computerized video, fax,
cellular phones, computing networks and vast data bases in one
seamless hardware and software package.
   But, he said, several obstacles need to be removed before his
scheme becomes reality.
   One is that personal computers are too hard to use. Another, he
said, is that ``people have a very narrow view of how the PC should
be used.''
   Gates' speech kicked off a weeklong Comdex show that promoters
say has attracted about 120,000 computer retailers, distributors
and others in the industry.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: That 'vision thing' again - Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO needs technology 'vision'? Certainly not International Business
Machines, according to Lou Gerstner, the computer giant's tough new chairman
and chief executive.
'The last thing IBM needs is vision,' he declared last month, in a statement
that is stirring widespread debate throughout the computer industry.
The 'vision thing' is a hot topic among those who like to wax lyrical about
their views on the path that technology developments will take in coming
years; 'information highways' and 'industry convergence' are their favourite
topics. All seem to see their companies playing a critical role as these
visions unfold.
Yet apart from drumming up enthusiasm for technology in general, is there
any value to this star gazing?
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, founded his company on a 'vision' of how
microprocessor chips would put 'a personal computer on every desk and in
every home,' and the opportunities that this would create for selling
software programs.
'Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder) and I wrote that down on day one,' Gates
recalls. Eighteen years, and several billions of revenue dollars, later
Gates still sets aside a few 'think weeks' each year to 'figure out trends
that are going to affect us and what we ought to be doing about them. It is
something you have to give a lot of thought to.'
What does Gates make of Gerstner's apparent disdain for vision? 'It depends
what you mean by vision,' he responds. 'In the broad sense, it is not
sufficient or necessary. But having a technology strategy, figuring out the
industry direction, the factors that are influencing the business and the
synergies between them is very important.'
According to Mike Maples, Microsoft executive vice-president: 'Vision is
knowing where to go'. Picking the technologies that are going to be
important and then being willing to invest in them is a key ingredient of
industry leadership, he maintains.
Vision can, however, be blinding. In the past, IBM was prone to seeing the
information industry through Big Blue-tinted glasses. Hence, the company
mapped out a grand strategy called SAA that pulled all the disparate pieces
of its technology together, but failed to recognise that the market was
taking a different path defined by industry standards.
Lew Platt, Hewlett-Packard chief executive, takes a more pragmatic approach
to 'vision'. 'While we're excited about our vision of the future and how HP
can participate in its creation, we don't intend to get blinded by 'the
vision thing',' he recently told customers. 'Computer makers must keep sight
of a 'basic truth'. We build things customers want. They are the architects
of our vision.'
However, customers with a vested interest in today's technology are not
always the best seers. Users of H-P computers no doubt foresee a great
future for Unix, but it is a fair bet that buyers of Microsoft's programs
look forward to new versions of Windows. Similarly, users of IBM mainframes
are unlikely to tell the company to get out of that business.
Too much vision can also be a dangerous thing, as Apple Computer has
discovered. While putting its energies into long-term innovative projects,
such as Newton, Apple has failed to maintain the momentum of its core
Macintosh personal computer business. Computer companies cannot afford to
become so excited about the future that they lose focus on near-term issues
and priorities.
Many high-technology visions also turn out to be pipe dreams. Steve Jobs's
Next Computer, which he had hoped to build into a computer company repeating
his success at Apple, is one of the most celebrated examples.
Indeed, there are many reasons to avoid technology vision. It can be
blinding, expensive, misleading and fleeting. Yet companies without it must
inevitably rely upon the foresight of others, becoming technology followers
rather than leaders.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Technology: Microsoft on-line to the future - The software
giant's planned information service for PC users is assessed by Louise Kehoe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft is set to bulldoze its way into the on-line computer services
business with the launch of the Microsoft Network, unveiled by Bill Gates,
chief executive, yesterday.
Gates described his vision of how data networks will change the way people
work, learn and communicate by the year 2005 at the huge Comdex computer
trade show in Las Vegas. He said his planned on-line service will be a
significant step toward realising the full promise of personal computing by
putting 'information at your fingertips'.
Microsoft's plans are not just futuristic dreams. The world's largest and
most profitable software company aims to make the on-line services business
a central element of its long-term growth. As well as investing heavily in
the new business venture itself, Microsoft is forming partnerships with
telephone companies, publishers and entertainment groups to create a broad
range of on-line services.
In preparation for these services, Microsoft has developed software for
users and information providers. The company is also proposing a business
model that it believes will draw substantial third party investment to
creating new interactive on-line services, greatly expanding the market.
The ultimate goal is to establish the Microsoft Network as a standard
'platform', or technology foundation, for interactive on-line services in
much the same way that its Windows program is the software base for a huge
variety of personal computer applications.
The Microsoft Network 'will provide a setting for a worldwide electronic
marketplace of products and services from Microsoft and third parties,' the
company says.
Access to the Microsoft Network will be one of the features incorporated in
Windows 95, a new version of the widely-used PC operating system program, to
be released next April or May. Purchasers of PCs loaded with the new
software as well as those who upgrade their current versions of Windows,
will be offered a discount or free trial of the basic communications
services of the Microsoft Network. These will include electronic mail,
bulletin boards and chat lines.
But Microsoft plans to expand its on-line services quickly with the addition
of newspapers and magazines, shopping catalogues, games and educational
services as well as its own base of services. To draw publishers to its
network, Microsoft is offering them flexibility in how they run and charge
for their on-line services.
An on-line magazine on the Microsoft Network might, for example, charge a
modest subscription fee but raise additional revenue from advertising. A
shopping catalogue might offer free access but charge a transaction fee.
Both will be able to control the look and feel of their on-line service to
preserve their brand image.
'We will be more flexible than existing on-line services,' says Bill Miller,
Microsoft director of on-line services marketing. 'Providers will not be
limited in the ways in which they realise revenue for their services. More
important, they will retain the majority of the revenues that their content
and services generate.'
Most of the current on-line services charge users simply according to how
much time they spend connected to the service and pay 'content-providers' a
flat 20-30 per cent share of revenue. For users, Microsoft's plan will mean
lower fees for basic services and the option to spend more on specific
information sources. It also eliminates the biggest drawback to exploring
new on-line services - the cost of connect time as you browse.
To support this new approach to the on-line services business, Microsoft has
created a sophisticated billing and tracking system that will be linked to
credit card and direct bank debit processing centres.
Through an agreement with Visa, the biggest credit card provider, Microsoft
is also creating tools to ensure security of on-line transactions using
encryption technology.
Microsoft has also developed software to make its on-line services easy to
use. Methods for navigating the service will be based on the familiar
Windows interface. One enhancement will be 'short-cuts' - the ability to
return to a favourite on-line service simply by clicking on an icon.
Companies could use such icons as a marketing tool, Miller suggests. They
might, for example, send icons to users via electronic mail in much the same
way that companies today distribute advertising materials in the post. Some
users will throw away this 'junk electronic mail', but others will be
tempted to click on the icon to look at the products or services on offer.
By matching its approach to on-line services closely to conventional
business practices, Microsoft expects to attract a broad range of potential
on-line service providers that have until now been struggling to figure out
how to make money in the new world of interactive multimedia services.
Companies going on-line via the Microsoft Network will none the less be
leaping into the unknown. It is yet to be seen how many of Microsoft's
Windows 95 purchasers will then sign on to the service.
In contrast, companies such as Mosaic Communications that are building
software tools to support electronic commerce on the Internet - the
international computer information network with an estimated 25m-30m users -
have an established customer base.
'Companies that are writing applications for the Internet today are going to
be best poised to create businesses in interactive digital services,' says
Jim Clark, chairman of Mosaic Communications, a venture that sells Internet
software. 'Large companies are flocking on to the Internet because it has
worldwide reach,' he claims.
'The Internet is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and the Microsoft
Network will end up being a footnote. I think it will fail. In the long term
it will become just another service on the Internet.'
In the short term, however, Microsoft's plans are sending a chill through
the commercial on-line services industry. CompuServe, Prodigy and America
Online, the three leaders in consumer-oriented on-line services, which have
about 6m subscribers, are scrambling to drop prices and upgrade their
services in anticipation of the Microsoft Network.
Microsoft acknowledges that the perceived threat to established services may
be overblown. 'The notion that Microsoft enters the market and the world
changes is crazy,' says Miller. 'From where I sit, we have a long way to go
to match the infrastructure and customers and partners of the existing
services.' While Microsoft's entry will undoubtedly create new interest in
on-line services, existing services 'are going to have an advantage over us
in terms of what they can offer to customers'.
But for how long? With some 20m to 30m copies of Windows 95 expected to be
sold in the first 12 months, Microsoft could quickly overtake all its
competitors and fulfil Gates's vision of 'extending the Windows-based
desktop (personal computer) to a worldwide community of people, ideas and
information'.

   A change of corporate culture is in store for
Michael Hallman, who is trading the presidency of Boeing Computer
Services for the same job at Microsoft Corp.
   Boeing is nearing its 75th anniversary; Microsoft was founded in
the mid-1970s. Boeing deals with everything from fax machines to
fluid dynamics models; Microsoft focuses on computer software.
   Boeing has airplane models expected to be in development or use
for 50 to 70 years; the software industry has to react to sudden
market changes.
   ``It's going to be a fun place to work,'' Hallman said in an
interview Tuesday. ``It's a place where you can work hard, be
successful and have fun doing it.''
   Hallman, 44, was named earlier this week by Bill Gates,
Microsoft's 34-year-old billionaire chairman and chief executive,
to succeed Jon A. Shirley, who retires June 30. Hallman will join
Microsoft April 2.
   Hallman, who also will be chief operating officer, described his
new job as overseeing day-to-day operations while company founder
Gates provides overall product and development direction.
   The key, he said, will be to help Microsoft cope with ``the
realities that rapid growth and large size create, but at the same
time ensure there's the entrepreneurial spirit and environment that
has kept the creativity flowing there.''
   Microsoft has about 5,000 employees and is expected to hit $1
billion in sales in 1990. Its operating system software for IBM
personal computers and compatibles is the industry standard.
Microsoft also leads in applications software such as word
processing programs and programming languages.
   At Boeing Computer Services, Hallman directed about 13,000
employees and a Boeing Co. division that does more than $1 billion
in business a year.
   About two-thirds of the division's work is for Boeing, but
selling computer time and its expertise in data management and
telecommunications brought about $360 million in sales last year.
   BCS handles information management for all Boeing divisions,
writes software and develops technologies such as artificial
intelligence and computer-aided design and manufacturing.
   It operates about $1.3 billion worth of computer gear, including
a state-of-the-art Cray supercomputer. It also has one of the
world's largest private telecommunications networks, linking six
major data centers nationwide.
   And its customers include large corporations and the federal
government _ the sort Microsoft also would like.
   ``I think that's an area where my background would lend itself
well,'' Hallman said.
   Besides selling to such customers, Hallman also brings the
perspective of an individual computer operator _ he has three in
his home _ and a large, corporate computer user. Boeing Computer
was in charge of acquiring the company's 43,000 personal computers
and the software for them.
   Hallman does not foresee Microsoft switching its emphasis on
desktop computers used by individuals and small businesses, but he
said the 1990s will see more personal computers linked in networks
and with large mainframes. Microsoft's products will need to
reflect that, he said.
   Hallman joined Boeing three years ago after spending 20 years at
International Business Machines Corp., much of that in sales and
marketing. He ran Boeing Computer's outside sales until he was
named president in November 1987.
   Microsoft spokesman Marty Taucher said Hallman's compensation
would be comparable to that of Shirley, who made $315,000 a year,
according to Microsoft's 1989 proxy statement.
   Hallman said he was approached by Microsoft about the
president's job last fall, with contact accelerating after Shirley
formally announced his retirement earlier this year.
   In recent weeks, Hallman said he spent a lot of time with Gates
and other Microsoft senior executives, discussing the job and
``making sure the chemistry was right.''
   ``Bill and I get along great,'' Hallman said. ``I think the
facts are we share the same enthusiasm and passion and vision for
where this technology is going to go.''
   Hallman added that the change in corporate history and style
from Boeing to Microsoft would be an advantage. ``It would be a
mistake to bring someone in who had exactly the same view because
no value would be added there,'' he said.

   Most alligator hunters were disappointed
after the first day of Florida's month-long gator season, but by
Friday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet.
   Thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legal
alligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky _ or not-so-lucky _ 230
people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons, nooses,
crossbows and almost anything but a gun.
   The first night of the 30-day hunt netted about 130 alligators
in 28 designated hunting areas across the state, according to the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. Thirty-eight were
bagged in the Everglades, while 36 were taken in the Lake
Okeechobee area, a spokesman said.
   Two novice hunters, David and Jerry Navin, snaked through a Dade
County canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyes
that give away the swimming reptiles, but the gators refused to
cooperate.
   ``There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they're
supposed to,'' chuckled David Navin. ``They're a little tougher
than we thought.''
   His brother Jerry called their experience ``on-the-job
training.''
   To the north on Lake Okeechobee, one of the designated hunting
areas, some gator pursuers reported better luck.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, of Brooklyn, N.Y., the only northerner
receiving a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worrying
beforehand that he might be unable to kill the animal even when he
captured it.
   With gator hides selling for $42 a foot and meat running up to
$6 a pound, Alpern and others persevered, though few expected to
bag their 15-gator limit the first night.
   Hide and meat sales from a single alligator can total $300 to
$500.
   ``We're having fun,'' said Bud Wolfe, an alligator hunter from
Oakland Park. ``Where else but in Africa can you go after a
500-pound animal that can kill you?''
   Early success came to Carlos Donate of Miami and his guide, Jay
Medore of Clewiston. They snagged a 8-foot-3-inch animal only 80
minutes after they started hunting on Lake Okeechobee.
   Once they got the gator reeled up to the side of the boat, they
shot it with a ``bang stick,'' a firearm-like gadget that is
allowed under the game commission rules.
   ``We blew one hell of a hole in his head,'' Donate said. ``It
was exciting.''
   He then taped the gator's mouth shut.
   ``It's scary putting that tape on his mouth, even with a hole in
his head,'' he said.
   Doug Mackie and Steve Prater, who work for the city of Pembroke
Pines' utilities department, bagged a 6-foot alligator and another
that was 8 feet or longer.
   Prater showed how he hooked one just beside the alligator's left
rear leg with a large hook on a heavy-duty saltwater fishing rod.
He said fighting the gator when it was hooked was very difficult,
and he snapped the heavy fiberglass rod.
   ``It was a deep-sea rod and it just plain snapped in two,'' he
marveled.
   Alligator hunting was outlawed in Florida in 1962 because
wildlife biologists feared overhunting of the ancient reptiles
might threaten the survival of the alligator.
   A small alligator industry has built up in recent years because
alligators have increasingly become problems by turning up in urban
areas and pestering and occasionally killing humans or their pets.
   Estimates place the current number of alligators living in
Florida at 1 million, and game commission officials said they are
now far from an ``endangered'' species.

MICROSOFT, the world's largest maker of personal computer software, is to
acquire Fox Software, a private developer of database programs for desktop
computers, for 1.36m Microsoft shares. The deal is worth about Dollars 175m.
Fox, based in Perrysburg, Ohio, specialises in database software, used to
organise libraries of data and retrieve information.
The acquisition heralds Microsoft's entry into the database management
software field, one of the few categories of desktop computer software in
which it does not compete. It has been developing its own database programs,
but has yet to launch any products.
With its acquisition of Fox and entry into the database program market,
Microsoft will compete with Borland International, the leading maker of
database software for personal computers.
Borland's stock price fell sharply on news of the Microsoft deal. After a
Monday close of Dollars 70.25, it traded at Dollars 64 at midday yesterday.
Microsoft's stock remained relatively steady, fluctuating between Dollars
128.75 and Dollars 129.87
Microsoft will combine its own development team with the Fox group at
Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle, Washington.
'Our intention is to combine expertise and provide users with a family of
complementary products, ' said Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief
executive.
Among these offerings will be Microsoft's in-house developed database
program, code-named Cirrus, for personal computers that run Microsoft's
Windows operating system.
Mr Gates said: 'We soon will be able to offer customers a complete family of
superior scalable database applications and development environments.' Mr
David Fulton, Fox's president, will join Microsoft to head its
recently-created database software division.

   Plans to install floating toilets for the
convenience of boaters on reservoirs east and west of here aren't
exactly getting flushed down the tubes by concerned officials.
   ``It may seem that this is something kind of frivolous, but when
you think about it, when you gotta go, you gotta go,'' Maricopa
County parks Director Bill Richwine said Thursday.
   For a boater on the northeast corner of Lake Pleasant, ``your
only alternative is to go ashore and get behind a cactus or go over
into the water and do it,'' Richwine said.
   Richwine envisions two floating toilets anchored in the upper,
more remote regions of the lake about 25 miles northwest of Phoenix.
   Each would be a one-holer restroom floating on pontoons. They
would have holding tanks similar to those in the portable toilets
used at construction sites, golf tourneys and concerts.
   Richwine said he would make the county Board of Supervisors
privy to his plans in two weeks in order to apply for a $90,000
State Lake Improvement Fund grant to pay for the restrooms and a
trailer to haul them.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service is considering putting six
floating potties on Roosevelt Lake about 60 miles northeast of
Phoenix, said David Killebrew of Tonto National Forest.
   The toilets are part of an $18 million improvement plan for the
popular water-sports site, Killebrew said. Construction is to begin
in 1990.

   A small alligator found snoozing in a
Memphis vegetable garden is just a run-of-the-mill reptile and not
a missing sex-changed gator stolen from Memphis State University, a
biologist says.
   The researcher who changed the missing alligator's sex examined
the garden gator and pronounced it a different, ordinary reptile,
Memphis State biology department Chairman Jim Payne said recently.
   The missing alligator was stolen last November from a biology
laboratory at Memphis State.
   The 2-foot-long gator was one of a dozen or so used to study the
effects of hormones and environment on reptile sex determination.
While still in the egg, it was changed from a boy to a girl.
   An alligator fitting the missing animal's description turned up
in a garden June 14, but the only person who could confirm the
reptile's identity, biologist William Gutzke, was in the Galapagos
Islands inspecting the sex organs of turtles.
   Gutzke passed through town a few days ago, examined the
alligator and decided it was not his, Payne said.

   With smoke, loud music and MTV-style videos,
Microsoft Corp. Tuesday formally introduced its new version of
Windows, a software product designed to make IBM personal computers
and their clones as easy to use as Macintosh computers.
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's 34-year-old chairman, told hundreds of
financial analysts, journalists and others at a New York theater
that Windows is ``a major milestone in the history of the PC
industry.''
   Many analysts agree. They say Windows could provide the
strongest challenge yet to Apple Computer Inc.'s popular Macintosh
by grafting its user-friendly operations onto International
Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatible models _
machines that are notorious for their arcane commands.
   Gates told the standing-room-only crowd _ and, by satellite
hookup, audiences in six other cities nationwide _ that his
Redmond, Wash.-based software company will spend $10 million
promoting Windows over the next six months. He called that a record
for the software industry.
   Microsoft plans to mail 400,000 demonstration copies of the $149
software to personal computer users, Gates told the audience after
a sound-and-light show that mixed hype, humor and product
demonstrations.
   More than 30 personal computer companies have said they will
include Windows with their machines, and dozens of software
companies are making applications programs compatible with the new
version of Windows.
   Windows could provide a major boost to Microsoft, which already
dominates the personal computer software industry. Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. projects Windows and related products will reap nearly
$500 million in revenues for Microsoft in the fiscal year that
starts July 1.
   ``I think it's the most significant announcement since the
introduction of DOS,'' said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., referring to the operating system for IBM personal
computers developed by Microsoft.
   ``This delivers a lot of the capabilities that normally have
been associated with the Mac to the PC,'' he said, referring to IBM
machines and their knockoffs.
   The loser, of course, could be Apple. A Windows-equipped IBM
clone could sell for as little as half the price of a Macintosh.
   Apple's stock dropped a total of $2 a share Friday and Monday,
after adjusting for a dividend, but rose $1.87{ a share Tuesday to
close at $41.37{ in national over-the-counter trading.
   Microsoft shares jumped $1.25 Tuesday to close at $71.50 in
over-the-counter trading, after rising a total of $5.50 Friday and
Monday in anticipation of the announcement.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to announce a
lower-priced Macintosh later this year and is working on a more
powerful version of its operating system.
   Most computer experts also say the Macintosh retains some
advantages over a Windows-equipped IBM machine, expecially for
intensive graphics-based uses.
   Microsoft, for its part, says it will not target Macintosh users
or potential users, instead pitching Windows to users of IBM
machines and compatible models.
   That strategy is due in part to the fact that 85 percent of the
computer market is composed of IBM machines or clones, compared
with the Macintosh's 7 percent share.
   Windows works on computers using Intel Corp.'s 80286, 80386 or
80486 microprocessors. That encompasses about 20 million computers
in use, out of about 50 million that use the DOS operating system,
Microsoft says.
   This is Microsoft's third version of Windows. The first version,
introduced in 1985, and a later enhancement both failed to impress
computer experts.
   Windows is product known as a graphical user interface. It
shields computer users from complex, typed commands by replacing
them with on-screen pictures called icons and a hand-held control
device called a mouse.
   Windows also expands a computer's useable memory capacity and
allows users to keep several applications programs active at once
by running them in sections of the screen called windows.

   An 8-foot alligator is a full day's work,
Dale Dunaway reckons.
   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick
hide at the tip of its tail. Then it's a slow and difficult cut to
the snout.
   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and
gut a gator,'' Dunaway, who operates one of Florida's few alligator
processing facilities, said Tuesday. ``There's no way around it.
It's hard work, you bet.''
   At the Gator House in the remote southwest Florida grasslands,
Dunaway and his relatives have sharpened their knives and readied
the pots in anticipation of the first statewide gator hunt since
the 37-year-old Dunaway was a boy spearing alligators at nearby
Lake Trafford.
   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, 238 license holders
will be stalking areas of the state where the gator population is
extraordinarly high. The hunt, the first since 1962, is needed to
trim the numbers of the once-threatened alligator, which has
rebounded strongly since strict anti-poaching measures were
instituted in the early 1970s.
   The estimated 1 million alligators in Florida is nearly double
the 1975 population, said Allan Woodward, head of the alligator
research unit for the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   With each permit holder allowed up to 15 gators, Dunaway is
prepared to easily exceed the 130 gators skinned at the plant since
it opened in 1986.
   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,
either skinning or hunting,'' he said. ``We're gonna be looking at
a lot of dead gators.''
   Some of the veteran hunters will be permitted to use the
equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen
wire and decorated by a few deer antlers and empty beer cans. A few
junk cars rest nearby while the cicadas scream incessantly.
   But the novice trappers, randomly selected from 5,000
applications, will watch their catch be pried apart.
   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide
covering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, which
sells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged
in a brine solution for about a week.
   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.
   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said
Dunaway. ``They got a powerful smell, and if you ever cut open the
stomach you better start running.''
   The meat _ which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti
sauce _ must be frozen within several hours after the alligator is
killed. One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230
pounds of meat.
   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like
that,'' said Dunaway's brother, Grant, 34.
   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and
uncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time from their
jobs to process the gators.
   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a pound
is break even.
   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.
   With state officials publicizing that a 10-foot gator could net
$1,000 in meat and skin, Dale Dunaway wonders if greed rather than
adventure is motivating the new hunters.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' he said. ``They don't figure in the
time, expenses _ and don't forget the danger. I'd like to see some
people's faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.
   ``But if they want to catch 'em, then we'll skin 'em. We'll just
say, `Stack 'em up.'''
   He folded his knife in a triumphant clap.

<TEXT>     Alsop's little bonus was reserved for the 30 or so executives who have
attended all five of his conferences. Returning to their rooms Sunday night,
they found a set of four nesting dolls on their pillows, each a caricature of
an industry leader.;   The largest was Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates,
who was painted holding a keyboard under one arm and a BASIC programming book
under the other. Inside Gates was Apple Computer chief John Sculley, holding a
can of Pepsi, its logo in Russian. Next was Sun Microsystem's head Scott
McNealy holding an anarchist's bomb and a scimitar. Last, and least, was a
tiny Steve Jobs doll.;   "I've paid Stewart $10,000," quipped venture
capitalist Nat Goldhaber, one of the lucky winners, "and this year I got to
sleep with Bill Gates."; (hbox);   BIG MIKE SPEAKS: What do $60 billion
companies and $6 billion companies have in common? According to Michael
Spindler, president of the $6 billion Apple Computer, the answer is "white
knuckles." That was one of the punch lines of an innovate-or-die speech
Spindler gave before a group of venture capitalists Tuesday, the highlights of
which were passed along by a heads-up attendee.;   Spindler's "In" list
includes pen-based computers, the concept of "computing" being replaced by
"remote access to data," software, and 100 MIPS desk top machines costing less
than $2,000. What's out? Well, Japanese computer companies, which are due for
a big shock because of their dependence on analog technology; UNIX, which
forgot the user, and DOS, which forgot the hardware; and Compaq Computer,
which is in the "bankruptcy zone" between innovators like Apple and Next and
low-cost producers like Dell.; (hbox);   PLAIN BROWN WRAPPER: Today's computer
users get most of their software either through retail stores or by mail
order. But the rapid development of optical CD-ROM disks may eventually make
that obsolete.;   A number of computer industry executives at the Agenda
conference said they wanted to be able to include their programs, along with
those of other publishers, on a CD-ROM disk that would be shipped with new
computers. The software would be "locked" until the user called an 800 number
that would appear during a demo of the software that would also be on the
disk. In exchange for a credit card number, the publisher would supply a
password that would unlock the software -- and permit access to the manuals,
which could also be stored on the disk.;   Publishers say the approach would
have many advantages over selling through stores, including reducing prices by
eliminating the margins that are now paid to distributors. It would also
permit users to enjoy comfortable demos of software in their own office at
their own pace, without the sales pressure.;   The only drawback now is that
too few computers are shipped with the optical disk drives. But the advent of
multimedia computers, which will rely on CD-ROMs for their dazzling graphics
and sound, may help accelerate CD-ROM software distribution.  </TEXT>

   Drawn by adventure and hopes of big
profits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting
ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.
   More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to
apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt,
designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened
by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million.
   Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and
streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as
much as $1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat.
   But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know
what they're in for.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old Dale Dunaway, who
operates one of Florida's few alligator processing plants.
   ``They don't figure in the time, expenses _ and don't forget the
danger,'' Dunaway said Tuesday. ``I'd like to see some people's
faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.
   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, the randomly selected
permit holders will be allowed to hunt in designated areas where
the gator population is extraordinarily high.
   Waterfront residents all over Florida called for a hunt against
the carnivorous reptiles after a 10{-foot bull gator killed
4-year-old Erin Glover in the Gulf Coast community of Englewood in
June.
   But game officials have placed tight restrictions on the hunt.
Permit holders will be working at night, when flashlights make the
reptiles' eyes glow eerily red. And they are not allowed to use
guns, relying on clubs, traps and hooks attached to poles.
   The harvest is limited to up to 3,435 gators, with each hunter
limited to 15 gators each.
   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,
either skinning or hunting,'' Dunaway said at his 2-year-old
processing operation in this remote southwest Florida town. ``We're
gonna be looking at a lot of dead gators.''
   Skinning an average alligator is a full day's work, Dunaway
reckons.
   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick
hide at the tip of its tail. Then, it's a slow and difficult cut to
the snout.
   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and
gut a gator,'' said Dunaway. ``There's no way around it. It's hard
work, you bet.''
   Some of the experienced hunters will be permitted to use the

For years Bill Gates' competitors have dreamt of the day he would wed. They
hoped that marriage would distract the chairman of Microsoft, and the
richest bachelor in the US, from his single-minded dedication to building
the world's dominant computer software company.
Hence the stock market's reaction to the news that 37-year-old Gates is to
marry one of his managers, Melinda French, 28, is puzzling, to say the
least. Microsoft's shares might have been expected to fall sharply, while
rival stocks outperformed. But Microsoft's shares have continued to climb
since the announcement.
The only possible explanation is that the market fears that the merger will
lead to the production of several Gates Juniors and that this will create
even more problems for the industry.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (14): Signposts on
the digital highway - Geoffrey Wheelwright on the shake-up in North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North American telecoms industry is in the grip of an acquisitions and
reorganisational frenzy brought on by a desperate desire to remake itself in
advance of the arrival of the much-hyped 'digital highway' or 'information
superhighway'. Governments and cable television interests also want to get
their own way in deciding the path this 'highway' will take, so the rush has
been on to make deal after deal that will give telecommunications 'content'
to offer users of the highway and enough strategic partnerships to make sure
that their particular section of the highway is not a dead end.
The truth behind all this hype is that the future could see the creation of
two or more digital highways in the US. One is likely to be controlled by
cable and satellite TV operators and the other by regional phone companies.
Given the huge political and financial will required to make such a thing
happen, it is most likely to take place first in the US (with much of Canada
probably coming along for the ride) - and much later, if at all, in the UK
and Europe.
For the past few years, as groundwork for the digital highway has been laid,
companies in both sectors have been scrambling to build strategic alliances.
AT&amp;T and the regional Bell operating companies (known as RBOCs) have built
the largest number of alliances with technology companies - while cable
television firms are scrambling to catch up.
The strongest political supporter of the information highway concept is Mr
Al Gore, the US vice-president, who has vigorously championed its
development in US political circles and has repeatedly spoken of what he
thinks its impact will be. One of his biggest pitches to US taxpayers to
support the development of the information highway has been on the subject
of job creation.
'All . . . applications (for the information highway) enhance the quality of
life - because they do, they will spur economic growth. After all, even the
quickest glance at the telecoms sector of the economy shows what it means
for jobs,' he says. 'Over half of the US workforce is now in
information-based jobs. The telecoms and information sector of the US
economy accounts for more than 12 per cent of the GDP. And it's growing
faster than any other sector of our economy. Last year total sector revenues
exceeded Dollars 700bn. And we exported over Dollars 48bn of
telecommunications equipment alone.
When AT&amp;T sold the first cellular phone, they said there would be 900,000 of
them by the year 2000. We have 13m now. And it's still 1993. The predictions
for mobile telephone users for the year 2000 now total 60m. This kind of
growth will create thousands of jobs in the communications industry. But the
biggest impact may be in other industrial sectors where those technologies
will help American companies compete better and smarter in the global
economy. If we do not move decisively to ensure that America has the
information infrastructure we need, every business and consumer in America
will suffer.'
So the real question in many people's minds is who will control access to
the highway - as well as the stops of interest along the way. The telecoms
and entertainment businesses have made the most noise about how they think
they will control the way the information highway develops - but they
apparently have not reckoned with the determination of the personal computer
industry. In particular, they have not taken account of the enthusiasm of
America's second richest man - Mr Bill Gates, co-founder and chief executive
of Microsoft - for the development of this delivery system.
He believes that the PC industry will be a key player in the development of
a national and international information infrastructure - and already has
advanced plans for Microsoft's role in that infrastructure. Bill Gates see
the starting point as information services delivered to millions of
consumers through devices attached to 'interactive' television sets.
'There will be a new device in the home connected up to the so-called
information highway that will be a replacement for the video game or the TV
or the PC,' he says. 'You will be able to call up any movie or show that has
ever been made. You'll be able to call up advice on medical things or
shopping or travel. You'll be able to find people of common interests, to
video conference with people that you know.
'It will be quite a general purpose device. It will take a lot of businesses
and change them. It will require a lot of software to do that well. There
are many software companies, including Microsoft, that are starting to see
this opportunity. We've hired several hundred people to work on this even
though it won't come to realisation for over five years.'
Bill Gates says the company 'won't get any revenue for at least three years'
from this project and 'will spend many tens of millions on it in the
meantime.'
So what is it that has given Microsoft such huge volumes of patience? The
simple answer is the realistic chance to make every home in America spent
money on Microsoft software. The software would be contained within the
system that delivers the information to the TV set.
Microsoft recently gave a demonstration of how this service could augment
existing TV entertainment. People watching a live baseball game, for
example, could use a handheld controller (not unlike the kind provided for
use with video game systems) to choose from a series of on-screen pictures
(to the left-hand side of the main picture) to bring up on-screen statistics
on either of the teams, any of the players, up-to-date out of town scores,
current position of players on the field  - and even order tickets (using a
credit card) to the home team's next game.
By tuning to an all-music TV channel, meanwhile, people can augment their
viewing with information on the artists singing the song, details about the
album it came from, what other albums the artists had released and, of
course, the chance to order the album by credit card.
The ultimate mix of computer technology, consumerism and TV, however, would
come with use of the shopping channel - where consumers could design
'virtual shopping malls' in which they were the only customers. These would
work by having the consumer designate which shops they would like to
frequent (from either an on-screen or published catalogue) and the system
would then respond by displaying a videogame-style representation of a mall
with shop fronts.
Consumers can then use the handheld controller to 'walk through' their
custom-designed on-screen malls - stopping at the shops whose goods they
might be interested in buying. These would be represented by on-screen shop
fronts which, when entered, would be replaced with an on-screen catalogue of
the goods available in that shop.
Mr Gates says that many telecom companies are talking to him about this plan
 -including US West, TCI, Time/Warner and AT&amp;T - 'it's the feeding frenzy or
gold rush around digital convergence,' he says. 'There are many people who
are trying not to be left out of the activities.'
