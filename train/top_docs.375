FT  26 NOV 94 / Thinking the unsinkable: The modern parallels exposed by an
exhibition about the Titanic, which sank in 1912
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of
artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia.
The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic,
on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a
modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after
it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912. Only 705 of the
2,228 passengers and crew survived.
Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the
two doomed vessels. Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but
both were found wanting.
The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the
cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than
the number of passengers and crew. Its designers added a 12 per cent safety
margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still
only enough lifeboats for half those on board.
A more comprehensive sub-division of the Titanic by internal bulkheads - a
design issue which is again being hotly debated after the Estonia sinking in
October - might have saved the liner, some experts think.
For 73 years the Titanic lay undisturbed, up to two miles down on the floor
of the Atlantic Ocean. The prospect of ever finding the vessel and answering
the unsolved mysteries of its sinking appeared remote.
But in 1985 the wreck was discovered by a joint French-US expedition.
RMS Titanic Inc, a New York-based company, was declared 'salvor in
possession', meaning that it had unique rights to explore the vessel and
raise material.
The company has since carried out three expeditions, the most recent in
July, using a submersible provided by the French Oceanographic Research
Institute. It has raised a total of 3,600 artefacts.
RMS Titanic is committed to raising material from the Titanic and putting it
on general display. It is pledged not to sell any of its finds.
Some 150 objects are on display at the maritime museum, include a ship's
porthole, metal deck bench ends and a letter from a manufacturer lamenting
the demise of the feather boa as a fashion accessory.
Video footage taken from the submersible shows the ship's rail, chandeliers
hanging in a long-abandoned state room and racks of plates.
The chance to stage the exhibition was offered to the maritime museum 'out
of the blue' by RMS, says Dr Eric Kentley, a curator.
There are no plans to take the exhibition to any other museums around the
world though the maritime museum and RMS are working on designs to establish
a permanent museum to display the material.
The Japanese meanwhile, have announced plans to build a full-scale replica
of the Titanic to act as a floating hotel and conference centre. All the
details of its interior would be replicated although there would be no
engines or steering gear.
As the Titanic sank into the darkness of the Atlantic it broke its back and
landed in two separate sections. When it hit the ocean floor the bow section
ploughed into the mud, obscuring to this day the details of how large a gash
was caused by the iceberg.
'The technology exists to remove the silt from the bow section but the
problem is to find the capital to get the equipment down there,' says John
Eaton, a historian with an interest in the Titanic going back more than 45
years.
Recovery of material has been limited to the sea around the vessel. A
decision to treat its interior as a grave site has meant that no attempt has
been made to raise artefacts from inside the hull. Although very few
survivors of the sinking are still alive 'people are very sensitive about
anyone going into the hull', comments Dr Kentley. Eaton confesses to finding
this ban 'very frustrating'.
Although the intense cold, the absence of light and low oxygen levels on the
ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the Titanic, chemical attack and
sea-bed bacteria have eaten into the metal, staining many objects black.
A comparison of the photographs taken in 1986, and those from a descent in
1993, show a marked deterioration of the wreck, says Eaton. Dr Kentley
thinks there may be as little as 10 years left to continue work on the hull
before it disintegrates.
RMS and its backers are keen to raise more material from the wreck. However,
even if a sudden deterioration was to halt work, enough has been raised to
create a powerful reminder of the fate of the Titanic, and any other vessel
and its crew which underestimate the power of the sea. The exhibition, says
Dr Kentley: 'Is a timely reminder that the sea signs no treaties.'

<HEAD>Titanic Memorabilia Auctioned On 76th Anniversary Of Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A postcard mailed from the Titanic fetched $2,068
during an auction Friday, the 76th anniversary of the ocean liner's
sinking, but a water-stained letter found on the body of a dead
passenger went unsold.
   The auction of 200 items of Titanic memorabilia raised $56,400,
Onslow's Auctioneers reported.
   A spokesman said the water-stained letter didn't sell because it
may have been considered too ghoulish.
   One collector paid $2,068 for the postcard stamped on the ship
and posted when it stopped in Ireland.
   Northern Ireland's Ulster Folk and Transport Museum paid the
auction's top price of $14,100 for a 1912 watercolor painting
entitled ``Fitting Out The Titanic, Belfast.''
   The Titanic, built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and declared
unsinkable, went down in the Atlantic on April 15, 1912, after
hitting an iceberg while on its maiden voyage from Southampton,
England, to New York. A total of 1,513 people perished.
   The wreck of the liner about 2.5 miles below the surface and 350
miles south of Newfoundland was first located by a U.S.-French
expedition in September 1985.

   It was news that the world had waited seven decades to hear. 
On Sept. 1, 1985, Robert D. Ballard announced that he had found and photographed the wreck of the Royal Mail Steamship Titanic, the largest and most luxurious liner that had ever plied the seas. 

   Mr. Ballard had triumphed -- where many before him had failed -- through a combination of determination, detective work and a firm commitment to advanced technology. 
In that first expedition and in a follow-up a year later, he and his scientific crew shot thousands of still photos and made hours of videotape of the Titanic's final resting place. 

   Now comes "The Discovery of the Titanic" (Madison Press/Warner Books, 230 pages, $29.95), Mr. Ballard's lavishly illustrated account of how the ship was located and what was found when it was. 
One needn't be a Titanic buff to be bowled over by the result. 

   The loss of the Titanic was one of those events that defined an era. 
Hailed as "unsinkable" (though not by either its builders or owners), it was speeding through the night on its maiden voyage when it struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912. 
It carried lifeboats for only a fraction of the 2,227 on board, and when it plunged 2 1/2 miles to the bottom of the frigid Atlantic it took more than 1,500 people with it. 

   For 73 years, the wreck had eluded all searchers. 
Enter Mr. Ballard, a geologist and self-described "submarine cowboy" working out of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. 
His previous deep ocean work in the Galapagos Rift and Eastern Pacific Rise had already gained him a measure of renown. 
Throughout those explorations, however, the lure of finding the Titanic remained, and each advance in oceanographic technology brought the dream tantalizingly closer. 

   Finally, in 1985, a joint U.S.-French team set out using some of the highest of high-technology equipment, including an underwater television camera capable of scanning the ocean's bottom. 
Mr. Ballard hoped to prove that video exploration of the oceans was both feasible and preferable to using manned submersibles. 
Yet the task was formidable -- far more difficult than finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. 
The explorers found the wreck on almost the very edge of the expanse of water they had identified as their primary search area. 

   The discovery, when it came, was a tremendous scientific achievement, but it also was a human one. 
Mr. Ballard writes of his emotions while standing on the deck of his ship at the exact hour and over the exact spot of the Titanic's demise: "It was one thing to have won -- to have found the ship. 
It was another thing to be there. 
That was the spooky part. 
I could see the Titanic as she slipped nose first into the glassy water. 
Around me were the ghostly shapes of the lifeboats and the piercing shouts and screams of people freezing to death in the water." 

   "The Discovery of the Titanic" is no idealized version of events. 
Mr. Ballard documents tensions within the crew over the approach to the search, as well as the rupture between the U.S. and French scientific teams after the discovery, when the French felt they were being deprived of their share of the glory of discovery. 
Mr. Ballard's own conceits -- some even bordering on arrogance -- come through as well. 
His insistence that electronic rather than human exploration is the wave of the future brought him into conflict with the group manning Alvin, the famous miniature submarine. 
Yet even this champion of new technology could not resist the desire to see the wreck through his own eyes: When he returned to the Titanic a year later, it was with Alvin -- allowing him physically to land on the deck of the Titanic and, using a swimming robot camera, explore the interior reaches of the wreck. 

   In any event, the book itself is splendid visual testament to Mr. Ballard's approach. 
The underwater photographs are stunning in both their clarity and their poignance: the empty davits that launched the too-few lifeboats; a doll's head lying incongruously on the ocean floor; a pair of shoes perfectly preserved long after the disappearance of any trace of the body that once wore them. 
Hundreds of color pictures of the rusting hulk -- often matched with vintage photos of how the ship looked in its heyday -- give eloquent testimony to its fate. 
Equally absorbing are paintings of what the entire hulk must look like now, by artist Ken Marschall. 

   The location and visual inspection of the wreck also cast new light on some of the mysteries surrounding the ship. 
It indeed broke in two before its final descent, as a few of the survivors claimed. 
The explorers found no evidence of the continuous gash many thought had been ripped in the hull; the evidence instead supports the notion that the collision caused the ship's steel plating to rupture intermittently. 
And the ship's location indicates it was not traveling quite as fast as was long believed -- though it was still moving much too quickly. 

   Many people might have thought that the Titanic should remain undiscovered. 
As with watching a magic trick, some of the wreck's fascination has always been rooted in mystery; know too much and the thrill is spoiled. 
It is a tribute to Mr. Ballard, and to this absorbing book, that he manages to preserve the fascination with the Titanic even while stripping away a significant amount of the mystery around its fate.

   After a fruitless search last year, the German
battleship Bismarck has been found on the ocean floor 600 miles off
the coast of France, 48 years after it was sunk by the British Navy.
   The Bismarck was located Monday under 15,000 feet of water by a
remote-controlled robot named Argo that scuttles across the ocean
floor. Argo and his master, expedition leader Dr. Robert Ballard,
also discovered the sunken Titanic four years ago.
   The Bismarck was sitting upright on the sea floor ``intact in an
excellent state of preservation'' about 600 miles west of Brest on
the Brittany coast, said Ballard, who is based at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod.
   The discovery is likely to trigger great curiosity among naval
historians, said Maj. Charles Neimeyer, a history professor at the
U.S. Naval Academy.
   ``They'll be looking for the sort of technology the Germans had
at the time, because this ship was considered state-of-the-art,'' he
said. The find could answer questions about the way the ship went
down and ``how the crew lived and survived at sea on a German
warship,'' he added.
   No human remains were found near the Bismarck, on which all but
about 100 of the 2,200 crew members perished. A memorial service for
those who perished was held aboard one of the expedition's ships.
   The ship will be left undisturbed as a grave site, like the
Titanic, according to David Gallo, assistant director of the Center
for Marine Exploration at Woods Hole. The battleship might be
explored by the sophisticated robot, though, Gallo said.
   Ballard and a research team searched several days for the
Bismarck last year. Instead of the Bismarck, the explorers found a
19th century sailing ship that has yet to be identified, Gallo said.
   ``There were quite a few reports about its position when it
sank,'' Gallo said. ``But the problem is, those reports can be off
by a mile or more, and a mile at sea, when you're looking at the sea
floor, represents a very large area to be covered in a search.''
   The demise of the dreaded Bismarck, which was equipped with eight
15-inch guns, began on May 24, 1941, when it encountered the Royal
Navy off the coast of Greenland.
   The Bismarck sank Britain's battle cruiser Hood but was hit by
the Prince of Wales. The Germans then fled south for occupied France
with the British in pursuit.
   Two days later, British warships and aircraft located the
crippled vessel and launched a furious attack. The Bismarck finally
went down the next day.
   The successful campaign was a significant victory for the Allies,
who thwarted Hitler's plan to use the Bismarck to raid Atlantic
Ocean shipping lanes.
   Neimeyer said the victory also gave a big psychological boost to
the Royal Navy, which was stunned by the loss of the Hood.
   ``Tis gave confidence to the carrier-aviation community that they
could indeed sink a battleship,'' he said.
   The expedition was jointly funded by Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. and a group of private investors. The National Geographic
Society plans to produce a documentary on the discovery that will be
televised next fall.

   Riding the waves, the Bismarck plowed across
the seas as the fiercest fighting ship in World War II. Collapsed
on the ocean floor, the German battleship looks cowed, a beaten
Nazi relic.
   The 1941 sinking of the Bismarck _ and this year's discovery of
its eerily well-preserved wreckage _ is the subject of ``National
Geographic Explorer,'' airing on cable's TBS on Oct. 29 at 9 p.m.
EST.
   The host of the one-hour special is Robert Ballard, the
oceanographer who previously discovered the remains of the Titanic.
The 1987 television account of the Titanic find still stands as
basic cable's most popular show.
   ``The Bismarck initially was just another hunt, just another
ship,'' Ballard said. ``But when I saw the faded remains of the
swastika on the ship's bow and stern, and a solitary seaman's boot
lying on the ocean floor, that symbolized to me the great tragedy
of World War II.''
   Ballard's Bismarck show will repeat Oct. 30 at midnight EST and
Nov. 4 at 8 a.m. EST. A videocassette of the program will be
released in December by National Geographic, whose November
magazine also details the Bismarck exploration.
   The Bismarck was the most formidable battleship of its era. In
its first tour of duty, the 820-foot floating fortress literally
blew Britain's prize battle cruiser Hood out of the water, killing
all but three of the Hood's 1,419-person crew.
   ``At the time, it was the most powerful ship on the sea,'' Peter
Schnall, co-producer of the Bismarck documentary, said of the
German warship. ``It threatened to stop basically all of the supply
ships that were coming in through the North Atlantic to England.''
   A terrorized Britain put every available warship into the
1,750-mile chase after the Bismarck. Prime Minister Winston
Churchill made his orders to his navy perfectly clear: ``Sink the
Bismarck!''
   Two days after destroying the Hood and racing for protection,
the Bismarck was crippled by a British torpedo-equipped biplane and
the country's carrier Ark Royal. The combined assault ruined the
Bismarck's steering gear and rudders.
   Functionally immobile, the warship was bombarded all night and
finally scuttled by the Germans. Only 115 of the Bismarck's 2,200
hands survived.
   ``The Germans put everything into'' the battleship, Schnall
said. ``But like everything, it had an Achilles heel. Knock out the
rudder and it's like a big ship with nowhere to go.''
   Ballard's finding the Bismarck required almost as much
determination and luck as did Britain's sinking it. With sonar and
video and still cameras whirring away, Ballard spent two summers
combing a 100-square mile area of the ocean's bottom 600 miles west
of Brest, France.
   ``Ballard's cabin was a couple of doors down from us,'' said
Schnall, who accompanied the oceanographer on the search. ``And all
of sudden one morning, we hear this incredible scream because
Ballard has a video monitor in his room. He had just woken up and
he saw it: just as (the underwater camera) was crossing the
midsection of the ship, right across the gun turrets.
   ``And he let out a whoop. That woke me up, we ran down and
grabbed our camera just as he was running out the door. ... It was
one of those rare moments in film when you catch something exactly
as it happens.''
   What Ballard's cameras found more than 15,000 feet below the
surface of the Atlantic startled the team.
   ``It looked like the ship had just been launched from its
original berth,'' Schnall said. ``It sat straight up on its
bottom.''
   There were no skeletons or human bones in sight.
   ``The exciting thing (about making the documentary) is that it
is almost like a natural story,'' Schnall said. ``You have the
Bismarck going out, you have the Bismarck eluding the British, and
then eventually being sunk.
   ``And we have an explorer (Ballard) who goes to find the
Bismarck, can't find it, has to regroup himself, and then go back
out again the next year and find it.''
   After the filmmakers collected footage of the Bismarck's
wreckage, they met with some of the men who once served on her
decks and showed them the underwater footage.
   ``Very slowly, they started to say, `Yes. Isn't that the gun
where I was standing?' Or, `Wasn't that the deck where so-and-so
was standing before it went down?'
   ``And on and on it went. Eventually, they saw the swastika on
the stern of the ship. ... One of the survivors, Heinrich Kuhnt,
was asked what it felt like to have survived this horrible sea
battle. And he hesitated. And slowly tears filled his eyes and he
couldn't stop crying.''

   The crew that discovered the
wreck of the Titanic used a robot diver Monday to explore a War of
1812-era wreck in Lake Ontario _ and shared the expedition with
children across North America.
   The camera-equipped robot examined the Hamilton, a merchant
schooner that the British pressed into service as a warship.
   Students at 14 spots in the United States and Canada watched
satellite TV transmissions. A few students even got to try steering
the robot through a satellite link, using joysticks like those used
with computer games. It transmitted pictures to students watching
through satellite hookups at 14 locations in the United States and
Canada.
   Cannons, railings and the ship's elegantly carved figurehead
could be seen in the television transmission.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, said the ship's
state of preservation was remarkable.
   ``We can see the caulking in the planks,'' he said.
   The Hamilton and its sister ship, the Scourge, sank during a
storm on Aug. 8, 1813, killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in
several battles for the British against U.S. forces that invaded
southern Canada during the war.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed in 300 feet of water six miles
off St. Catharines, about 30 miles south of Toronto and less than
10 miles west of the U.S. border at Niagara Falls, until their
discovery in 1975.
   Since then, there have been several attempts to examine the
wrecks, including one by French explorer Jacques Cousteau. But none
were technologically advanced enough to reach them.
   The cold, fresh water helped keep the ships in much better
condition than most wrecks, said Shelley Lauzon, a project
spokeswoman.
   ``The wood on the Titanic is all gone because there are
wood-boring animals in salt water,'' Lauzon said. ``They're not
present here.''
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The ocean
liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in 1912.
   Ballard said Monday's examination of the Hamilton and the
Scourge was aimed more at teaching children about archaeology and
oceanography than at making startling new discoveries about the two
warships.
   ``We've had four students actually take control and operate the
vehicle beautifully,'' he said in an interview by ship-to-shore
telephone. ``That was the biggest technological feat.''
   The children controlled the robot with a joystick linked to the
system by satellite, Lauzon said. A computer program restricted the
robot's movements so the children could not damage it.
   Although there were no archaeological breakthroughs, the
expedition did reveal a number of details not known before, Ballard
said.
   The two-week expedition will prepare a comprehensive diagram of
both ships and could provide information allowing the city of
Hamilton, which has title to the wrecks, to decide whether they are
worth raising. Ballard said there appeared to be little damage that
would stand in the way of such an effort.
   ``There's no suggestion that they suffered any damage due to the
sinking itself,'' he said. ``They just got flooded and went down
very gently.''
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole.

Robert D. Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the 
Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship 
Bismarck. In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the 
dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far 
beyond air and light by plummeting hulks of steel and iron.

"People say, 'What was it like to go to the Titanic, particularly out in the 
debris area, the stern section where everyone died?' " Ballard recalls of the 
ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic in 1912, 
killing 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. "There are pairs of shoes all 
over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean. Their 
shoes are still there. Shoes all over the Bismarck, boots all over the place. 
Animals won't eat processed leather. They eat the body and the clothes but they 
won't eat the leather." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanographer Ballard, in Los Angeles to announce that he will host a 
television series about underwater explorations and other scientific ventures, 
is somewhere in the middle of a long explanation about why he pursues the 
sunken past with such avidity. Partly, he concedes, it's for the sensations 
that only discovery can provide.

"I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set

saw the Titanic, wow! There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the 
gloom and there it was."

For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant 
when he connects palpably with history. "The best experience that I can give 
that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand," he says. "To 
go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the 
cavalry. That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds. You sense Crazy Horse 
there . . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation. Well, when 
you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here. It's no 
longer abstract." 
</P>
<P>
Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more 
than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern 
California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became 
captivated by the Pacific Ocean. Now, four years after the discovery of the 
Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the 
47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation. This time 
around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the 
technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National 
Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic 
and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It is the kind of popularizing of science 
that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers. But Ballard says 
he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that 
may help convince children that science is a "contact sport." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact 
with history and science. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from 
land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much 
interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations. So Ballard's 
expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with 
sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras 
controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8. (This kind of 
exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that "we had 100,000 pounds of 
equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree.") 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea -- 
50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation," 
Ballard says. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden 
voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean. The 
battleship was in "16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range," 
Ballard says, not without enthusiasm. "It was in an awful place and it was in 
the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice 
stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the 
Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the 
ocean floor. "I do it because of the challenge to do it," he says. "But I'm 
also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved. . . . There is 
probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the 
museums of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and 
torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing 
the "huge painted swastikas" on the ship's bow and stern. 
</P>
<P>
In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns 
capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines, 
was one of the most powerful warships afloat. And briefly it proved to be just 
that. Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to 
attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy 
looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was 
dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material. 
Discovered by two British heavy cruisers 
</P>
<P>
on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships. 
From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood, 
starting a fire in an ammunition locker. Within minutes the Hood exploded, 
killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members. The Prince of Wales was 
also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Bismarck, "the British were lucky to get it to the bottom," Ballard 
claims. In the climactic battle, a "freak hit" by a torpedo launched from a 
vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the 
crippled battleship to "wait for the British to come and get it." Of course, 
the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of the Bismarck, Ballard says there has been curiosity 
about what actually caused the ship to sink -- British firepower or scuttling 
by her own crew. But Ballard believes the evidence makes the point moot. The 
British warships had orders to sink the Bismarck, not capture it, and the 
Germans were under orders not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war 
prize, he says. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. on May 27, the captain of the Bismarck ordered his crew to open the 
seacocks on his disabled ship, thus flooding the hull, Ballard recounts. About 
10:30 a.m., the Bismarck was hit by three torpedoes from the British cruiser 
Dorsetshire and sank three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bismarck's Survivors 
</P>
<P>
"So it was on its way down and the torpedoes helped -- but it was on its way 
down," Ballard says. "If they hadn't opened the seacocks, I'm convinced the 
British would have sat there and plunked torpedoes into it until it sank. So 
it's sort of academic who sank it." Only about 100 of the Bismarck's crew 
survived. Nearly 2,300 perished, including several hundred who were swimming in 
the water after their ship disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It is that moment that seems to galvanize Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Bismarck sank, approximately 800 living souls went into the water and 
were alive after the ship went under," he says, leaning forward in his chair. 
"And the Dorsetshire came in and began picking up survivors and then someone 
thought they saw a periscope and they took off and they left 700 people in the 
water alive. . . . Can you imagine the awfulness, the hopelessness, the despair 
of the sailor who's just had a ship blown out from underneath him? He's 
paddling and freezing to death in this water and salvation is right there and 
he's grabbing hold of the hull and the ship takes off." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has said he will not reveal the exact location of the Bismarck except 
to German authorities. As a ship of war, the battleship belongs to Germany, he 
says, although there might be some debate about which half of that divided 
country would have the more legitimate claim. 
</P>
<P>
As with the Titanic, Ballard says he strongly believes that such relatively 
recent wrecks should be left undisturbed, memorials to those who perished. As 
for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be 
explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical 
knowledge. In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to 
the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developed Deep-Sea Robots 
</P>
<P>
But Ballard seems to be chiefly an enthusiast, not a critic. In particular he 
is a proponent of machines, especially robots. Ballard has headed up the 
development of a system of deep-sea unmanned robots -- called the Argo-Jason 
system. Equipped with cameras and other sensing devices, the robots are now 
capable of plumbing the world's deep waters faster and more safely than the 
tiny, slow, manned submarines that previously were the cutting edge of ocean 
research and exploration, he says. 
</P>
<P>
While an unmanned robot named Jason Jr. was used in a 1986 expedition to the 
Titanic, it was only within the last few months that the leap was made "to 
fully robotic exploration," Ballard says, meaning that robots can now be 
directed from a surface ship rather than from a manned submarine via a control 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
It's a relief that he and others won't have to spend five or more hours per day 
"commuting" to the ocean floor, which averages 12,000 feet in depth, he says. 
Even though he has spent a lot of time in cramped research submarines and 
probably will spend more, Ballard is miffed by the inefficiency of the 
"romantic little guys," referring to the small submarines. 
</P>
<P>
He explains: ". . . you're spending five hours a day freezing to death in this 
little sphere. Our average dive time on the Titanic was three hours a day. 
Three hours out of 24 and you've got 50 people and you've got one guy looking 
out of a window." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Interest in Science 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has been talking about the potential of this technology for years. But 
recent advances have made him more convinced than ever that the concept of 
"telepresence" will revolutionize not only undersea exploration but the way 
many people "travel." More important, he sees the technology as capable of 
rekindling interest in science among American schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now reaching a point in technology, in imaging devices both acoustic and 
visual, fiber optic transmission links, digital enhancement, computer 
manipulation, robotics etc, etc. to simulate presence," he says in a gee-whiz 
way. "In fact many of us in the technology believe it will become a pervasive 
way of people living their lives. In other words, ultimately you won't travel 
that much. You'll travel in a telepresence way. We can have this conversation 
half a world apart and you'll sense my presence, I'll sense yours. . . . The 
idea of the Argo-Jason system is to put you in a room and convince you you're 
in a submarine looking out a bunch of windows" that are in fact video monitors 
displaying scenes picked up by robot-mounted cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, whose professional base is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod, is such a believer in the concept of telepresence that 
he's already using it to change the way he lives. He recently built a house 
near Montana's Glacier National Park in which he is installing a satellite 
antenna so that he can bounce his image and voice into space and back to Earth 
for professional meetings and conversations with people far, far away. His goal 
is "to create a place where I don't feel professionally inconvenienced by 
living in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
How much time he actually will spend in northern Montana is an open question, 
though, given the demands of the Explorer television series. 
</P>
<P>
With the series, including a program on the Bismarck to be broadcast in late 
October, Ballard asserts that he can do his bit to instill a respect for the 
past and take millions on magical mystery tours of the kingdoms under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
". . . 70% of the planet's under water. We've seen less than .1% of 1%. I mean 
we know more about the mountain ranges on Mars than the mountain ranges of our 
own planet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Vast Unknown 
</P>
<P>
It is this sense of the vast unknown here on Earth that he wants to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the concept of an explorer has been somewhat diminished," he says. 
"People now retrace Hannibal's route in a Winnebago or they walk backwards to 
the North Pole. It's sort of become a Guinness Book of World Records type of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
And he says he wants to do his part to protect good old people-friendly dry 
land too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important right now to realize that the Earth is in jeopardy and 
we're the first generation that can kill it and we're killing it," he says, 
leaving the battles of World War II far behind. ". . . This baloney about 
living in space is baloney. You send everyone else out there and give me 
Montana. I have no desire to live underwater. I've seen the place."

   In regard to your Feb. 21 page-one article about the new
investigation into the Titanic disaster: I wrote a
college-term paper on the subject 37 years ago. According to
my research then, Capt. Stanley Lord ordered his wireless
operator to contact the Titanic and advise it that he had
stopped his ship, the Californian, because of the iceberg
conditions. He was told by the Titanic's operator to "shut
up" because his current was interfering with its outgoing
commercial messages.
   In 1912, Marconi wireless operators did not maintain a
24-hour watch aboard transAtlantic vessels -- so, at 11:30
p.m., the Californian's operator removed his earphones and
went to bed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At 11:40 p.m., the Titanic struck the iceberg and shortly
thereafter began to fire off its white distress flares. Capt.
Lord, when informed of this, noted that it was probably just
the Titanic's passengers celebrating the maiden voyage of the
new luxury liner. He ordered his crew to attempt to
communicate with the Titanic by Morse light and returned to
his bed. Capt. Lord's men continued signaling with the light
until 1:30 a.m., but got no response from the Titanic. It has
been suggested that the Titanic's officers and crew were far
too busy loading their passengers onto lifeboats to have seen
the Californian's flashing signals. Several surviving
passengers later recalled seeing the lights, and some of them
said they rowed their lifeboats toward them.
   Following the investigations on both sides of the Atlantic
into the Titanic sinking, steamship companies were required
to keep a radio operator on duty round the clock.

   On the cold, clear night in 1912 that the RMS Titanic
struck ice and sank into history, a heinous crime occurred.
   As the icy Atlantic gushed in through the great liner's
hull, passengers and crew spied a flicker of hope. On the
horizon, the lights of another ship appeared. They signaled
to it, firing rockets high into the sky. But the ship didn't
respond. In fact, "it seemed as if the vessel was turning
around and leaving us," a survivor recalled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The mystery ship steamed off, abandoning about 1,500
people to drown in the chill black sea; 705 survived.
   Thus began one of maritime history's great whodunits --
and one that has suddenly inspired new investigations in
Liverpool, England. What ship was it? And why, as a U.S.
Senate committee of the day put it, did it disregard "the
dictates of humanity, international usage, and the
requirements of law?" Armed with new evidence, the British
government has reopened its Titanic files and named a special
examiner to plumb this 79-year-old mystery. "This is a unique
investigation," says a government spokesman.
   At issue is the guilt or innocence of Stanley Lord, the
English sea captain whose cargo ship, the S.S. Californian,
was accused of being the mystery vessel. Capt. Lord was
napping in his chartroom that fateful night, while junior
officers were said to have dithered on the bridge. He denied
it, but went to his grave in 1962 portrayed as the monster
who slept while hundreds drowned.
   "Reprehensible and un-British," was how one London
magazine damned his conduct. His supporters, on the other
hand, view him as a scapegoat. They say he was blamed to
divert public outrage from the real reason so many died that
night: lax safety regulations that enabled the Titanic to
scrimp on lifeboats.
   Indeed, Capt. Lord's culpability is again being
challenged, and he may soon have his reputation restored. If
the British examiner exonerates him, a parallel campaign
could gather steam in Washington to correct the record there.
The grand aim, says Leslie Harrison, the captain's former
union leader and chief defender, is to correct "the grossest
miscarriage of justice" in British seafaring history.
   The prospect has the small world of Titanic scholarship in
a maelstrom. For 30 years, a tiny -- and now very aged --
crew of British and U.S. history buffs has debated the late
captain's case. Like a schismatic church, they are split into
Lordites and anti-Lordites. The Lordites say the Californian
wasn't the mystery vessel. Bilge, say the anti-Lordites. The
two sides trade jibes in such journals as "The Titanic
Commutator," a quarterly publication of the U.S.-based
Titanic Historical Society.
   "Passions are high. I have spent more time working on this
one issue than any other" about the Titanic, says Walter
Lord, author of the 1950s best-seller about the sinking, "A
Night to Remember." Confusingly, Mr. Lord, now 73, is an
anti-Lordite. He is also "no relation of ours, thank
goodness," says Stanley T. Lord, who is a Lordite and the
captain's 83-year-old son.
   Steering the course for the Lordite faction is Mr.
Harrison, who has been Capt. Lord's tireless defender since
1958. That year, Mr. Harrison recalls, a tall, elderly
captain appeared in his Liverpool office one day and declared
with authority: "I'm Lord of the Californian." The name meant
nothing to Mr. Harrison, then a clerkish young idealist who
had spent much of his own brief sea career leaning greenly
over the rail. But the captain explained: A new British
movie, "A Night to Remember," based on the book, was
dramatizing the charges against him and he wanted his union's
help to defend his name.
   Since then, muses the now-elderly union leader -- he is 78
and retired to a cottage overlooking the sea -- "my life has
been one of constant battles with people."
   In trying to prove the captain's innocence, Mr. Harrison
scoured musty archives, tape-recorded hours of conversation
with the captain and took affidavits from Titanic witnesses.
He badgered British politicians for a rehearing. To publicize
the case, he spent four years writing a book on it -- and 10
years trying to get it published. When it finally appeared in
1986, it sold 1,720 copies. He even quarreled with his own
union colleagues, some of whom urged him to drop the case as
hopeless.
   He refused. "My approach to life is scrupulous honesty,"
Mr. Harrison says, struggling to explain his persistence. "So
long as there's this absolutely gross slander on his name,
I've got to do what I told him I'd do: Not drop the case."
   According to Mr. Harrison's book, "A Titanic Myth: The
Californian Incident," Capt. Lord had prudently stopped his
ship that night in mid-Atlantic upon encountering a vast ice
field -- the same field into which the Titanic was then
heedlessly steaming. On the horizon, he spied a ship that he
took to be a tramp steamer, but which a junior officer
thought resembled an ocean liner. Capt. Lord signaled to it,
but it didn't respond. So with everything quiet, he left the
bridge after midnight for a four-hour nap on the chartroom
settee.
   As the mariner slumbered, the sea brought strange sights.
"I observed a flash of light in the sky," the officer on
watch said later. It was a white rocket -- possibly a
distress signal -- and it rose near the unidentified vessel.
Seven more rockets followed. After conferring by speaker-tube
with the sleepy captain, the bridge tried signaling the ship
again; still it didn't respond. Then it disappeared --
steamed away, the officer on watch said; sank, U.S. and
British inquests said.
   The next morning, the Californian's wireless operator
learned of the Titanic's sinking from other passing ships.
"Where have you been all night?" one ship asked. "Been
asleep?"
   The questions came to torment Capt. Lord. After landing at
Boston, his ship was named by a U.S. Senate committee and by
a British inquest as being the vessel seen from the Titanic.
Cowardice was the crime: He and his officers were accused of
ignoring the distress rockets in order to avoid a risky
nighttime rescue through an ice field. Capt. Lord denied
this; but he was disgraced -- a scapegoat, Lordites say,
referring to the alleged cover-up of the Titanic's lack of
lifeboats.
   "They wanted to find somebody to blame, and they pounced
on father," says his son.
   Even so, Capt. Lord continued to get commands, thanks to
his reputation among shipowners as a skillfull and safe
captain.
   The chief Lordite theory is that -- far from seeing each
other that night -- the Californian and Titanic were watching
a third, unidentified vessel steaming between them. One
suspect is a seal ship called the Samson, said to have been
hunting illegally in the area. It supposedly mistook the
Titanic's lights and rockets for a U.S. Coast Guard patrol
and fled. But anti-Lordites contend there is little evidence
to support that -- and even if there was a third ship, the
Californian's officers were still negligent in failing to
investigate the rockets.
   This dispute percolated until 1985, when new evidence
emerged. Deep beneath the North Atlantic, an American team of
oceanographers discovered the Titanic's final resting place,
several hundred miles off Newfoundland. The spot was close to
where Capt. Lord had always claimed it would be -- a fact,
Lordites argue, that corroborates a key claim in his defense:
That the Titanic and Californian were too far apart to have
seen each other that night.
   But anti-Lordites still dispute that reasoning. They say
locating the wreck of the Titanic says nothing about the
location of the Californian. The British government, however,
took the new theory seriously enough to reopen the case. The
fate of Capt. Lord's reputation is now with a special
examiner, Capt. Thomas Barnett, a retired government marine
surveyor.
   Whatever happened that night, Capt. Lord himself wasn't
without regrets. Rather than rely on the watch, he wished
that he had risen from his couch to inspect the situation on
the bridge himself. The result, he once told Mr. Harrison,
was "there's always this stigma: Was Lord to blame, or was he
not to blame?"

   A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests
that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was
scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a
celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said
Thursday.
   During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his
ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and
proud'' two weeks ago.
   Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British
background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed
himself to the German people in German.
   ``I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said,
translating himself back into English. ``We found no human remains.
We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck
is in the hands of the German people.''
   He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so
Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship,
which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
   Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him
that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to
surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
added.
   It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German
pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the
neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the
secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked
out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her
secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking
hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.
   Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered
British biplanes, it was unable to escape.
   Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by
ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas
it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized
that the Germans were giving up.
   Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's
technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
   The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of
water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He said it was in
remarkably good shape, ``elegant, well preserved.''
   Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had
left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit
with a ringing three-word command: ``Sink the Bismarck!''
   Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of
German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might
have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five
more survivors.
   The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have
posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut
British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against
combined German sea and air power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within
five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a
three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the
vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
   Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the
property of the German people.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same
remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the
wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912
after striking an iceberg.

   Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose
deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the
bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the
World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew.
   At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery,
Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the
robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to
find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank
in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
   The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the German Navy when
it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the
Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gydnia, Poland, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys
of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when
England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air
power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck, but five
days after the Bismarck went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss
of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of
World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature.
   Ballard said the Bismarck was found ``in a remarkable state of
preservation. There doesn't appear to be as much damage as I had
expected.''
   Ballard is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts.
   The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about
600 miles west of Brest, France.

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic.
   The dead, many of them emaciated from Confederate prison camps,
totaled more than 1,500, but newspapers of the day gave scant
notice. The horror was lost in the greater gore of Civil War and
presidential assassination.
   Until now, there had been no marker here for the Union soldiers
who perished in the muddy Mississippi. But on Sunday, a six-foot
granite marker is being unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a
reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles
north of the city's downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the steamship was
carrying more than 2,300 people plus 100 horses and mules when
three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis, estimated the death toll at
1,547, 44 more than the number of people lost when the ocean liner
Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   The monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will be the
second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, was put up in 1916 by Sultana survivors
who raised money for the monument.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.
   The Mississippi has shifted its course since the Sultana went
down, and the steamboat's remains rest now under a soybean field
about a mile east of the river in Arkansas, Potter said.
   Excavating the boat could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and would produce little of commercial value since the wreck was
salvaged two months after it burned, he said.
   Berryman, who wrote a paper on the Sultana last year for the
Journal of Forensic Sciences, said survivors told of watching
dozens of victims drown en masse, hands clasped together as they
grappled for survival.
   ``Many of these victims had been through some of the roughest
battles in the war, and those experiences paled in comparison to
what they went through that night,'' he said.
   Most of the victims had recently been freed from prison camps in
Alabama and were headed north to be released from the Army. Many
were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheeler's four
18-foot boilers, one of which had developed a leak that was hastily
repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of victims into
the fire, Berryman said.
   The 263-foot boat, made of wood and covered with flammable
paint, was equipped with 76 life jackets. Many of the survivors
also escaped by clinging to debris. One survivor floated to shore
on a dead mule.
   The Army investigated the disaster and a captain in charge of
loading the troops at Vicksburg was found guilty of mishandling his
duties. His conviction was overturned on appeal, however, and he
was honorably discharged.

<HEAD>Titanic Inquiry after 78 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a
steamship captain who was criticized for not coming to the aid of
the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government said Monday.
   The Titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic
on April 14, 1912. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people aboard the
ship perished.
   The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will examine testimony
at the 1912 inquiry into the loss of the great liner to throw light
on the role of the late Capt. Stanley Lord, said a Department of
Transport spokeswoman.
   The inquiry comes in response to a campaign by Lord's relatives,
who have been trying to clear his name, said the spokeswoman. She
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The inquiry was first reported in Monday's editions of The Daily
Telegraph, which said a crucial piece of evidence would be the
position of the wreck as determined in 1985 by U.S. oceanographer
Robert Ballard.
   Lord was master of the Boston-bound Californian, believed to
have been the ship nearest to the Titanic when it struck the
iceberg.
   The Carpathia and other ships which were farther away than the
Californian did reach the scene in answer to the stricken liner's
distress calls.
   Lord's ship was stopped by ice at the time. The original inquiry
censured him for not responding to distress rockets from the
Titanic and ruled that as he was 8 to 10 miles from the liner he
could have gone to its aid and saved lives.
   Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in
an icefield 20 miles or more from his ship and that he was unable
to help. A campaign to clear his name has been carried on by his
son and other supporters, and an earlier petition to reopen the
inquiry was rejected in 1965.
   Lord insisted that a ship seen from the Californian was not the
Titanic. The ship was only identified in 1962 as the Samson, a
seal-hunter.
   ``Supporters of Capt. Lord claimed he was a scapegoat for the
failire of the Titanic's owners and the Board of Trade to make sure
there were enough lifeboats,'' The Daily Telegraph said.
   It quoted Capt. James de Coverley, deputy chief of marine
accidents, as saying the 1912 inquiry would not be reopened as that
had been into the Titanic's loss, not Lord's conduct.
   ``We are not in the business of rewriting history but in this
particular case it was considered desirable to have a
re-evaluation,'' de Coverley was quoted as saying.

   Scientists using a robot diver to
explore two War of 1812-era wrecks let schoolchildren across North
America in on the expedition.
   The underwater look Monday at the merchant schooner Hamilton and
its sister ship, the Scourge, was televised live to 13 museums.
Four youngsters watching got to operate the robot using a computer
joystick hooked up by satellite.
   The cold, fresh water of Lake Ontario and the 300-foot depth of
the wrecks helped preserve the two ships, which were pressed into
battle service by the United States during the War of 1812.
   Cannons, railings and an elegantly carved figurehead could be
seen as the black-and-white television image panned slowly.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, and other scientists
gave a running narration and took questions from viewers at the
museums in the United States and Canada and at the Canadian
Football Hall of Fame in Hamilton, a city 25 miles west of St.
Catharines that has title to the wrecks.
   ``The ship is in immaculate condition. We can see the caulking
in the planks,'' Ballard said. ``There's no suggestion that they
suffered any damage due to the sinking itself. They just got
flooded and went down very gently.''
   The Hamilton and the Scourge sank during a storm Aug. 8, 1813,
killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in several battles against
British forces in southern Canada.
   However, the wrecks narrowly escaped damage from large ships
that dragged their anchors across the lake bottom, Ballard said. He
said the furrows caused by the anchors were plainly visible near
the wrecks.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed six miles off St. Catharines, 30
miles south of Toronto on the lake's southern shore, until their
discovery in 1975. Since then, scientists such as French underwater
explorer Jacques Cousteau have used submarines and remote cameras
to explore them, but Ballard's expedition was the most
technologically sophisticated yet.
   In an interview by ship-to-shore telephone, Ballard said the
children's participation was the most significant part of the
program. He said the remote control setup had never been used
before.
   Ballard said the two-week expedition would produce a detailed
map of the wrecks that Hamilton officials could use in deciding
whether to raise them someday.
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The storied
ocean liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in
1912.
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole, Mass.

   Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose
deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the
bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the
World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew.
   At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery,
Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   Ballard said he could only speculate on why the German commander
decided to send his vessel to the bottom in May 1941. He said
perhaps it carried technologically advanced equipment that the
Germans did not want to fall into British hands.
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
said.
   In 1939, after a battle with three smaller British ships, the
German pocket battleship Graf Spee was cornered in the neutral port
of Montevideo, Uruguay. Adolf Hitler ordered it scuttled, possibly
to prevent the British from learning the secrets of its construction
and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's four main guns were quickly
knocked out of action and the attacking British ships were out of
range of the Bismarck's secondary guns, Ballard said. With the ship
helpless and taking hundreds of hits, its sinking was clearly
inevitable, he said.
   Asked if the Germans couldn't have surrendered the ship to save
lives, Ballard said there was no mast left on which a white flag
could have been hoisted.
   Asked if the Germans couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire,
Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have
been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the German
fire had ended.
   The British ships did halt their gunfire but continued to send
torpedos, Ballard said. However, he said, the lack of evidence of an
implosion in the remains persuaded him that the ship had been
blasted open by its own crew rather than sunk by British torpedoes.
   He said he would keep secret the exact location of the Bismarck
and let the German people decide its future fate.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the
robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to
find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank
in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
   The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the German Navy when
it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the
Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gydnia, Poland, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys
of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when
England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air
power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck, but five
days after the Bismarck went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss
of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of
World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature.
   Ballard said the Bismarck was found ``in a remarkable state of
preservation. There doesn't appear to be as much damage as I had
expected.''
   Ballard is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts.
   The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about
600 miles west of Brest, France.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pioneering space probe suggested
Saturn's largest moon might be covered with an ocean of liquid
natural gas, but scientists who bounced radar off its surface say it
may have some dry land or an icy surface.
   ``We interpret our results to mean that the surface of Titan is
highly variable,'' planetary scientist Duane O. Muhleman said in an
announcement issued Monday by the California Institute of Technology.
   Titan, nearly twice as massive as Earth's moon, is one of only
three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres. The
others are Jupiter's moon Io and Neptune's moon Triton.
   Data from Voyager 1 in 1980 suggested that methane and ethane,
components of natural gas, condense in Titan's mostly nitrogen
atmosphere and rain on the surface, leading some scientists to
believe Titan might be covered by up to a mile of liquid ethane and
methane.
   Muhleman and his colleagues bounced 360,000-watt radar signals
off Titan during three 5{-hour periods on June 3, 4 and 5.
   An ethane-methane ocean would have low reflectivity, creating
weak radar echoes. Instead, they found strong radar echoes during
one observation period and weak echoes during the other two while
Titan rotated on its axis. That suggests Titan has oceans in some
places and a solid surface in others.

FT  04 APR 92 / The Titanic's tales of terror: Alexander Garrett on a famous
maritime disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER GARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE afternoon of the April 15 1912, Bruce Ismay, managing director of the
White Star Line, filled out a Marconi telegram form for company headquarters
in New York. 'Deeply regret to advise you Titanic sank this morning 15th
after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life,' he wrote. 'Further
particulars later.'
Ismay was aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, one of 705 survivors - 1,516
perished. But his message remained unsent until 5.50 am on the 17th, nearly
two days later. The wireless telegraph was Carpathia's only contact with the
world, and as its operator worked round the clock to send out messages from
survivors, the signal from the White Star managing director - confirming
what the world already feared - was overlooked.
Today, a vessel involved in a collision would be in contact with coastguard
authorities within seconds. Then, the delay caused enormous uncertainty,
provoked accusations of censorship, and added one more mystery to the
intrigue surrounding the disaster.
On Tuesday April 14, Ismay's communique is one of 448 radio signal messages
relating to the Titanic to be sold at Christie's in South Kensington,
London. Together they provide a poignant chronicle of events in the world's
most famous maritime disaster, 80 years ago this week. The collection is
being sold by John Booth, who has exhibited them at the Titanic Signals
Archive for the last three years.
That these signals survived is remarkable. At the time the Titanic went
down, telegraph companies kept originals of all transmitted signals for 12
months. Messages from ships involved in the Titanic disaster were assembled
for the two public inquiries, one in the US, the other in London. After
that, they were returned to the Marconi company where they were held in a
vault until the late 1940s.
When Cable and Wireless took over the Eastern Telegraph Company - as it had
by then become - the signals were earmarked for destruction, but they were
salvaged by an unnamed employee, whose son found them hidden in a suitcase
when his father died 30 years later. Booth later acquired the signals. He is
selling them now, he says, 'because my wife says they take up too much of my
time'.
Before the wireless was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896, ships
communicated with each other by flags and light signals.
But when the Titanic set sail from Southampton on Wednesday April 10 1912,
she had the most powerful wireless yet fitted. She was one of the first
liners to have two wireless operators - John Phillips and Harold Bride, both
employed by Marconi - who could together provide a round-the-clock radio
watch.
Early in the voyage, they were busy telegraphing arrangements for passengers
to meet relatives in New York. It was a lucrative business for Marconi: each
message cost 30 shillings, at a time when the second wireless operator
earned 50 shillings a month.
It is the tone of optimism that is striking. One starts: 'Fine voyage fine
ship feeling fine'. Another: 'Hardly wait to get back. Cable made me awfully
happy. Love Mutzie'
One, however, was more ominous. 'Westbound steamers report bergs growlers
and field ice in 42 N from 49 to 51 West. April 12th Compts Barr'
On April 12, the Touraine radioed to report 'dense fog and thick icefields'.
Further danger signals followed from the Californian and the Caronia. One of
the great unresolved questions of the disaster is why the Titanic's captain
continued to sail towards the danger zone at 22 knots, especially as Harold
Bride, the Titanic's surviving wireless operator, told the US inquiry that
he had passed on the message from the Californian, and it had been
'personally acknowledged' by Captain Smith.
Later that day a fateful message was sent: 'Sinking wants immediate
assistance'.
The shortcomings of the wireless - as then operated - become evident
immediately following the collision with the iceberg. Unlike the Titanic,
most of the ships that night had only one radio man, if any.
Thomas Cottam, sole operator on the Carpathia, should have finished duty at
midnight. At 12.30 he was about to retire when the first distress signal
came through. The Carpathia sailed to the Titanic's aid at full speed, but
it was 60 miles away, three and a half hours sailing. Another ship, the
Californian, was (by its own controversial account) only 19 miles away, but
its wireless operator, Cyril Evans, had gone to bed. A third vessel, the
Norwegian trawler Samson, may have been even closer, but had no radio.
Marconi was later asked why his apparatus did not have a bell to wake the
operator. He replied: 'On the old equipment used by ships there was a bell
arrangement, which did not work well because it alarmed the operators of all
ships, as well as the one called.'
'Titanic struck iceberg sunk Monday 3 am. Carpathia picked up many
passengers am proceeding New York. Captain Rostron.'
The signals flying through the airwaves created total confusion for the
press. In New York, The Evening Sun trumpeted 'All saved from Titanic after
collision.' The following morning in London, the account in The Times was
riddled with contradiction. After reporting that the Titanic had sunk with
'great loss of life,' it cited later that she was being towed by The
Virginian to Halifax, or was heading under her own steam to New York.
By the following day, April 17, the full extent of the tragedy had become
clear and the recriminations began. The Times scolded the Central News
Agency over a phantom wireless message which had reported everybody safe;
while questions were asked about signals being 'interfered' with by 'amateur
operators'.
An explanation for one of the 'phantom' signals later materialised. A radio
ham unwittingly merged two signals, one asking 'Are all Titanic passengers
safe?' and another from the Asian announcing she was towing the German
tanker Deutschland to Halifax. The result: 'Titanic passengers safe being
towed to Halifax.'
Before the Titanic went down, its two radio operators were given permission
to leave their posts. Bride was washed overboard, but was picked up by the
Carpathia. As the Carpathia headed back to New York, he assisted Cottam in
sending messages from survivors. A few remained cheerful, as: 'Meet me dock
with two hundred dollars underwear cap big coat. Am well but feet slightly
frozen answer George.' Others were tragic: 'Mother girls safe father Charlie
missing'. 'Father not seen no hope arrive Carpathia Wednesday New York.
Richard.'
The US inquiry made a number of recommendations about the use of
radiotelegraphy on ships. But although the Titanic sinking had highlighted
its shortcomings, the momentous significance of radio communication for
sea-going vessels was elegiacally summed up in a Times editorial on April
16:
'But for wireless telegraphy, the disaster might have assumed proportions
which at present we cannot measure; and we should have known nothing of its
occurence for an indefinite period . . . The advantages conferred by this
abridgment of space are enormous. No vessel need be alone, none need vanish
without a sign from human ken; and in none but crushing and instant
disasters need any despair of help.'

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic, and the
muddy Mississippi River coughed up burned and bloated bodies for
weeks afterward.
   But until Sunday, no memorial had been created in this onetime
Confederate stronghold for the Union soldiers who perished aboard
the steamship, many of them emaciated survivors of Confederate
prison camps during the Civil War.
   Before a small crowd of about 50 people, a 6-foot granite marker
was unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a reminder that the
Sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the city's
downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the paddlewheeler was
carrying more than 2,300 people, in addition to 100 horses and
mules, when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April
27, 1865, less than three weeks after the end of the war.
   Most of the more than 1,500 people who died had recently been
freed from prison camps in Alabama and were headed north to be
released from the Army. Many were crowded onto two decks directly
over the paddlewheeler's 18-foot boilers, one of which had
developed a leak and been hastily repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed, forming a funnel that dumped dozens of the victims
into the fire, said Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Berryman estimated the Sultana death toll at 1,547.
By comparison, 1,503 lives were lost when the ocean liner Titanic
hit an iceberg and sank in the remote North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded the boat at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   ``Our figure is probably a conservative one,'' Berryman said.
   The Sultana monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will
be the second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, Tenn., was put up in 1916 by Sultana
survivors who raised money for the monument themselves.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war,
Berryman said.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.

<LEADPARA>  Sea ice has set records on both sides of the world, with more in the Atlantic
and less in the Far East than ever recorded, government scientists said
Friday.;    Ice in the Atlantic reached 60 miles farther south than the record
set last April and was nearly to the region where an iceberg sank the Titanic
in 1912, the Navy-NOAA Joint Ice Center reported.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SEAS GROWING MORE ICE ON ONE SIDE OF EARTH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At the same time, sea ice reached a record minimum in the Sea of Okhotsk,
north of Japan, said Josh McDowell of NOAA.;    The Navy's and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's center in Suitland, Md., tracks sea
ice as a warning service for shipping, seeking to prevent disasters like that
of the British liner Titanic.;    The maximum extent of the ice reached nearly
to the latitude of Boston -- though far to the east -- before pulling back
this week, officials said.;    Normally, sea ice reaches its maximum in April
in the North Atlantic. Cold weather could lead to an extension of the ice
edge, McDowell cautioned.;    Detailed information on the extent of sea ice
goes back only to 1972, when satellites began tracking frozen areas.;   
During that period, McDowell said, growth of ice on one side of the planet has
been accompanied by a decline on the other side.;    Sea ice is a sheet of
frozen salt water several inches thick along its edge, McDowell explained.
Temperatures have to be about 29 degrees Fahrenheit to freeze seawater.;   
While the sea ice could damage a ship that was not specially strengthened, it
was not the cause of the Titanic's demise. That ship fell victim to a floating
iceberg. Icebergs are large chunks of ice that break away from land and float
south.;    More than 1,500 people died when the Titanic struck the floating
mass of ice and sank April 14, 1912, on its first Atlantic crossing.  </TEXT>

ECHOES FROM SATURN'S LARGEST MOON; 
</P>
<P>
RADAR IMAGES TELL OF DISTANT ETHANE OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is so far away that takes light 2 1/2 hours to 
travel there and back, but scientists have managed to bounce a radar beam from 
California off its surface and capture its echo in New Mexico to learn more 
about a moon that lies hidden beneath a dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
What they learned is that Titan has an ocean of liquid ethane, which many 
scientists had expected because of the chemical composition of its atmosphere. 
But they also learned it is not entirely covered by the ocean, which few 
scientists had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"The radar echo from Titan is the weakest such echo that has ever been 
measured, yet we were able to obtain a great deal of information," Duane O. 
Muhleman, a Caltech planetary scientist, said in announcing the finding Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The echo was weak, but it varied considerably, indicating that Titan has an 
ocean with beaches and maybe even mountains, though hardly the type to lure 
tourists. The beaches may well be ice, since the surface temperature is 290 
degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surface Composition 
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable to assume that the solid surface is made up of water ice, and 
perhaps solid carbon dioxide, silicates and tars," Muhleman said. "If the 
surface can support hills and mountains, they could stand above the liquid 
hydrocarbons and the surface may resemble oceans and continents, but this is 
pure speculation. Our experiment was designed to narrow the range of 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists for years have used radar to study distant bodies, because the 
strength of the echo tells them much about the texture of the surface. It also 
penetrates clouds, thus offering a glimpse at what lies below. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Titan, that process was carried to new limits. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists used a 230-foot antenna at Goldstone, in California's Mojave 
Desert, to transmit a 360,000-watt signal for three 5 1/2-hour sessions on June 
3, 4 and 5. The antenna is part of the Deep Space Network that the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration uses to track spacecraft speeding through 
the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
After traveling 2 1/2 hours to Titan and back, the signal -- traveling at the 
speed of light -- was received at the Very Large Array, a huge radio telescope 
consisting of 27 large antennas near Socorro, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roughness Measured 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the echo depends on the electrical reflectivity and the 
roughness of the surface of the target. A deep ethane ocean would have very low 
reflectivity, which is exactly what the scientists found most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
But on June 4 an echo was received that was far too strong to have been 
reflected by an ocean, indicating it came instead from a highly reflective 
surface and was similar to echoes from Venus. On two other occasions the signal 
was much weaker than normal, suggesting the surface of Titan is very irregular. 
</P>
<P>
Since Titan rotates about 23 degrees per day, the scientists concluded that it 
was presenting different faces to Earth, and those faces were quite variable. 
</P>
<P>
The full portrait of Titan, which has nearly twice the mass of Earth's moon, 
will have to wait awhile. NASA hopes to eventually send an unmanned probe to 
Saturn and its moons, but that proposal is still in the design stage. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Muhleman in the Titan radar project were Martin Slade, a planetary 
scientist at JPL, and Caltech graduate students Arie Grossman and Bryan Butler.

   Underwater scientist Robert D. Ballard is
becoming host of ``National Geographic Explorer'' on SuperStation
TBS because he says the movie and television image of scientists is
driving young people away from science careers.
   ``We're going to change the show's emphasis to more live
exploration,'' said Ballard, the man who found the Titanic and the
Bismarck and recently led an expedition to a sunken Roman ship. That
effort was telecast live to several hundred thousand youngsters in
12 museums across the country.
   His discovery of the Nazi battleship Bismarck, resting upright in
15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France, will be
shown in an October episode of the weekly ``Explorer'' series. The
fabled World War II ship was sunk in a battle with British naval
forces on May 27, 1941. Ballard found the ship June 8.
   ``I want to motivate children and show them that science is a
contact sport,'' said Ballard, who will become host in September.
``We've created an image that scientists are nerds. And that's
created a devastating effect on interest in science as a career.
   ``The battle for children's minds is between grades four to 12.
Right now 50 percent of all the students in American colleges
studying sciences are foreign students. We're now 17th in the world
in science literacy, behind Spain, Hungary and Ireland and
hopelessly behind Germany, Japan, England and the Scandinavian
countries.''
   He warned that if more American students don't become interested
in science the United States will slip economically, industrially
and militarily.
   ``The image children have of scientists is that of a harebrained,
forgetful wacko that they get from movies like `Back to the
Future,''' said Ballard. ``Children want to fit in with their peer
groups, they don't want to look like some silly guy.''
   Ballard is more in the mold of Indiana Jones. He has participated
in or led more than 60 deep-sea expeditions. He is a senior
scientist in the Ocean Engineering Department of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, head of the Deep Submergence Laboratory
and director of the institution's Center for Marine Exploration.
   The 50,000-ton Bismarck was the biggest battleship launched by a
European power and was such a threat to the Allies that British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered an all-out effort to ``sink
the Bismarck.''
   The Bismarck sank the British battle cruiser Hood on May 24,
1941, but two days later British torpedo planes damaged the ship's
steering gear and rudders. The crucial battle came the next day.
   ``The Germans lost their main guns and control in the battle,''
said Ballard. ``The captain ordered the ship scuttled at 10 o'clock.
She was equipped with the latest in military technology and he
didn't want the ship captured. The ship was struck by more torpedoes
at 10:36 and sank three minutes later. Of 2,200 crewmen aboard the
Bismarck, only about 115 survived.
   ``The ship capsized and its gun turrets, which were held in place
by their weight, fell out. She landed upright and other than the
missing turrets and some superstructure damage she is in remarkable
condition. The Nazi swastikas are still visible on her deck.''
   The Bismarck was examined by the deep-sea robot Argo, which
Ballard also used to find the Titanic four years ago. The robot is
equipped with sonar, video cameras and still cameras. Pictures taken
by Argo, its tender and the mother ship on the surface will be used
in the ``Explorer'' program in October.
   The Jason Project in the Mediterranean Sea explored a 3rd Century
Roman ship and undersea volcanoes. Six one-hour shows of the
exploration were sent live by satellite to 12 museums in a two-week
period. Each museum had an exact replica of the control facilities
aboard the other ship so that the youngsters saw exactly what
Ballard saw only one-half second later.
   Future live television projects will take Ballard to the Great
Lakes to look for two ships sunk in the War of 1812, to Lake
Champlain to look for a gunboat sunk in the Revolutionary War, to
the Pacific off Okinawa to explore the Japanese battleship Yamata
and to the Pacific to examine the Japanese aircraft carriers that
attacked Pearl Harbor and were sunk in the Battle of Midway.
   ``We have a large program of exploration lined up and will have
the continued involvement of young people,'' Ballard said. ``We'll
take some children into the field, but most will participate by
telepresence. It will almost be like being there because they will
be surrounded by video pictures. On the Great Lakes project we will
have joy sticks in the museums that will let the youngsters actually
control the robot.''

<HEAD>New Ship Communications Signal End Of Morse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World shipping leaders have given the go-ahead for
the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the
end of the Morse code for ships at sea.
   The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and
receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for
ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the
new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.
   Some parts of the new technology, which includes satellite
communications, are already in use on British ships and from 1999
they will be compulsory on ships worldwide.
   The decision was taken Friday during a two-week London conference
of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency
for the safety of shipping and preventing ships polluting the seas.
   The 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of
the world's ships, said spokesman Roger Kohn.
   A statement afterward called the decision ``one of the biggest
advances in maritime communications since the introduction of
radio.''
   The new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by
pushing a button, which should prevent ships disappearing without a
trace when messages cannot be sent in time.
   Ships will also carry a radio beacon, which will give the ship's
position and must be able to float free if the ship sinks suddenly.
   Kohn said: ``Morse has great romantic connotations with the
gallant radio operator sending off distress calls as the ship sinks.
But we are bringing in something that will be much better and which
should save even more lives.''
   The Morse code, invented by American Samuel Morse and first used
in 1844, has been the foundation of ship's distress and safety
messages since the turn of the century. It is a series of long and
short electronic ``dots and dashes'' representing letters of the
alphabet.
   Morse code was used to inform an incredulous world that the
supposedly unsinkable oceanliner Titanic was sinking in the North
Atlantic in 1912. The Titanic sank swiftly and 1,500 people perished.

<HEAD>Woods Hole Celebrates 60 Years of Ocean Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WOODS HOLE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning in 1930, with $3 million from
the Rockefeller Foundation and a small ship called Atlantis,
scientists began exploring the ocean from this tiny seaport at one
corner of Cape Cod.
   Since then, oceanographers from Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution have discovered vast underwater mountain ranges,
strange life forms in the Galapagos Islands, hot water springs
miles beneath the ocean surface and even the RMS Titanic.
   Even the movie ``Jaws'' featured Richard Dreyfuss as a scientist
from Woods Hole called in for his expertise on the great white
shark.
   Indeed, after 60 years of exhaustive research, experimentation
and technology, scientists at Woods Hole can say this with pride:
Men have now seen 1 percent of the ocean floor.
   One percent? This from a nation that sent men to the moon two
decades ago? Scientists at Woods Hole will tell you that time and
money would be better spent here.
   ``It's much more important that we use the tremendous technology
we have to understand ourselves,'' said John Steele, a senior
scientist at Woods Hole and former director of the institution.
``We have major scientific problems as well as social concerns here
on Earth.''
   The success of the scientists at Woods Hole is remarkable given
the lack of glamour attached to oceanography and the scarcity of
funds available for research.
   The government spends about $390 million in oceanographic
research annually. In contrast, President Bush proposed this year a
$15.2 billion space agency budget.
   ``Perhaps we aren't as good at selling ourselves as NASA,'' said
Steele. ``But we also all had, even scientists, the mistaken belief
that the bottom of the ocean was flat and uninteresting.
   ``Without the capabilities of Woods Hole and other institutions,
we wouldn't understand the Gulf Stream and why it's important to
problems of climate. We wouldn't have made wonderful discoveries
under the sea bed and we wouldn't have appreciated the marine life
in the deep ocean.''
   It can be as tricky to send scientists down to the ocean's
average depth of 12,000 feet as it is to send astronauts into
space. The incredible pressure and the absence of light make the
construction of underwater vehicles and other technology laborious
and expensive.
   But the marine biologists, geologists, engineers, divers,
technicians, chemists, physicists and many others who comprise the
900 employees at Woods Hole believe many of the solutions to the
world's environmental crisis may lie beneath the ocean surface.
   Woods Hole is the largest private oceanographic institute in the
world and relies mostly on grants, about 80 percent of them from
the federal government. Unlike its West Coast counterpart, the
state university-affiliated Scripps Institute in La Jolla, Calif.,
Woods Hole does not receive state money. It has an operating budget
of $67 million a year.
   As a result, Woods Hole scientists have been likened to
entrepreneurs, each in charge of their own destiny and relying on
their creativity and vision to come up with successful grant
proposals.
   Among the 350 projects at Woods Hole, one of the most eagerly
anticipated is the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, a global
study of sea patterns. The 10-year, $100 million project will track
how the ocean influences climate over periods longer than weather
forecasts of a few weeks.
   Scientists from the Soviet Union, China, Brazil, Britain,
France, Spain and Australia, among others, are part of the project.
They began gathering at Woods Hole more than three years ago to map
the project.
   ``The ocean plays a significant role in determining the impact
of the greenhouse effect,'' said Terrence Joyce, a senior scientist
at Woods Hole who is directing the hydrographic program for the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment. ``WOCE will give us an idea of
how the ocean affects climate change and allow us to better predict
the future.''
   Woods Hole, or WHOI (pronounced ``Hooey'' by local residents and
employees), has been on the cutting edge of oceanography and marine
science since its inception. It was founded following a
recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences that an American
oceanographic lab was needed on the East Coast.
   The sprawling ``campus'' of Woods Hole dominates the small town,
which extends like a little finger off the southwestern corner of
Cape Cod. The large brick buildings of Woods Hole line the
village's main street, with water on both sides.
   The campus consists of four large laboratories and a variety of
smaller buildings in the village of Woods Hole and on the nearby
200-acre Quissett campus. The institution offers a graduate degree
program for future oceanographers with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
   Work at sea is conducted aboard three large research vessels, a
smaller coastal vessel and the Alvin, a three-person, deep-water
submersible.
   During World War II, Woods Hole researchers developed
anti-fouling paint, which prevented barnacles from forming on the
hulls of boats, and the bathythermograph, an instrument that gives
a record of temperature layers in the ocean.
   Since 1964, scientists at Woods Hole have been able to penetrate
the ocean frontier with the aid of Alvin, which has made more than
2,000 dives all over the world and can go as deep as 13,000 feet.
   Alvin's most dramatic early mission was reminiscent of the film
``Dr. Strangelove.'' In 1966, two military planes collided over
Spain and a hydrogen bomb fell into the Mediterranean. Alvin pilots
found the device and then relocated it after it slipped down a
steep slope during a recovery attempt.
   In 1974, Alvin joined Project FAMOUS, a French-American undersea
study and collected the first-ever photographs and samples of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
   Woods Hole has a celebrity scientist, Robert Ballard, who
discovered the wreck of the Titanic in 1985. Ballard discovered the
German battleship Bismarck last year. He also is host of the PBS's
National Geographic ``Explorer'' TV series.
   ``Woods Hole tends to support high-risk people more than a
public institution would,'' said Ballard. ``It's very comparable to
private industry versus the government. There's a greater risk if
you fail, but it lets you try.''

project whisked them to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, live
and in color.
   Television screens showed them the satellite-relayed view of a
camera-equipped submersible robot being towed over the ocean floor.
It was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected
250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to Florida.
   The project suffered a temporary setback last week when the
7-foot-long robot Jason, a newer version of the camera-carrying
submersible that explored the sunken ocean liner Titanic, sank
among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of
Italy.
   The cable used to lower the million-dollar Jason and its mobile
garage or transporter, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100
feet to the soft, silty ocean floor.
   Organizers said the show would go on _ with or without Jason.
The robot was resurrected apparently undamaged Saturday but still
wasn't used in Monday's 40-minute broadcast.
   Jason has propellers and can be remotely guided in and around
underwater objects. Its replacement Monday, Medea, was merely a
sophisticated camera platform that is towed over a target area from
the surface.
   In addition to the underwater shots, expedition leader Robert
Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic, talked to the students from the
bridge of the support ship Star Hercules in the Mediterranean. He
took questions from students at three of the 13 participating
museums, narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and
introduced films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek
voyager Jason, for whom the 20th-century undersea robot was named.
   ``Our journey to the Mediterranean has been anything but
uneventful,'' Ballard said in recounting Jason's mishap. ``The
voyage became a nonstop exercise in problem-solving.''
   During weeks of lessons and classroom discussion, the students
have developed an affection for the little robot explorer.
   The biggest laugh of the morning came when a boy identified only
as Kenneth, a grade-school student from Memphis, Tenn., got to
question Ballard.
   ``Is Jason alright?'' he asked.
   ``Jason is fine,'' Ballard said. ``His pride's a little hurt but
luckily none of his instrumentation is.''
   Greg Tardiff, a seventh grader from Beverly, Mass., said word of
Jason's loss last week spread rapidly through the Shore Country Day
School.
   ``We were crushed,'' the 13-year-old said. ``We thought the
whole thing would be called off.''
   Paul Fontaine of Boston's Museum of Science said he was
``thrilled'' with the show's premiere, although disappointed that
the slightly less than state-of-the-art stand-in took Jason's place.
   ``Jason is the superior robot and probably could have picked a
bigger variety of images,'' he said. ``But it was still a pretty
impressive show.''
   For some of the kids, too, the show wasn't quite the same
without Jason.
   ``The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would
seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said
10-year-old Almas Rathod of the Walter J. Paton School in
Shrewsbury, Mass. ``It wasn't like that.''
   But classmate Barry Lyall said it met his expectations.
   ``It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a
classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of Scotland said. ``It was the
next best thing to being there.''
   The project sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution , Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the National
Geographic Society and Electronic Data Systems.
   In addition to Woods Hole, participating museums are The Boston
Museum of Science; the Museum of Natural History in Denver; the
Detroit Science Center; the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the
Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in
Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.) Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia; the Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center;
Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic
Society Grosvenor Auditorium in Washington; and the Royal British
Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia.

An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a steamship captain who was 
censured for not helping the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people on board died when the ship struck an 
iceberg and sank in April, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will examine testimony at the original 
inquiry to gain new insight into the role of the late Capt. Stanley Lord, said 
a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry comes in response to a campaign by Lord's relatives, who have been 
trying to clear his name, said the spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Lord was master of the Boston-bound Californian, which was believed to have 
been the ship nearest the Titanic when the British liner went down in the North 
Atlantic while steaming to New York on its maiden voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Other ships that were farther away did reach the scene in answer to the 
stricken liner's distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
Lord's ship was stopped by ice at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in an ice field 20 
miles or more from his ship and that he was unable to help.

A Norwegian coast guard ship cut through thick Arctic ice Tuesday to rescue 
hundreds of people who had taken refuge on ice floes and in lifeboats after 
their Soviet cruise liner hit an iceberg and took on water. All of the nearly 
600 passengers were reported safe. 
</P>
<P>
"All the passengers are now off the vessel and only (some of the) the crew 
remains," said Arne Finne, a spokesman for the Rescue Center in Bodoe, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, some of the Soviet crew members -- who had remained aboard the 
Maxim Gorky -- stabilized the badly listing vessel and sailed toward port with 
the help of a coast guard ship and several pumps flown from Norway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
740 Reach Spitsbergen 
</P>
<P>
Early today -- more than 25 hours after their ordeal began -- about 740 
passengers and crew of the estimated 950 aboard reached the Norwegian Arctic 
outpost at Spitsbergen, officials said. Passengers were taken to the airport on 
the tiny island of 1,000 people for chartered flights back home. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the Soviet crew had worked to keep the 630-foot ocean liner 
afloat in the Norwegian Sea, about 185 miles west of Spitsbergen, while the 
rescue ship and helicopters saved passengers huddling in blankets in the 
near-freezing temperatures. There were no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky rammed the iceberg in the foggy Arctic twilight shortly after 
midnight, when many of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from my bed," said 
Rudolf Ludwig, 67, of Wiesbaden, West Germany, one of the passengers on the 
midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by helicopter to Norway's Svalbard 
island. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told to get into the lifeboats," Ludwig said. "We sat for five hours 
among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the Russian sailors did 
everything they could. They gave us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it 
was cold. And blankets, too." 
</P>
<P>
West German passenger Win-fried Prince said there was no panic, and "the 
Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking passengers into lifeboats, 
and also the Norwegians who picked us up . . . have done a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ripped Two Holes 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred early Tuesday when the iceberg ripped two holes in the 
ship, which quickly took on water. Passengers said three decks became 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
The coast guard vessel Senja, its bow reinforced for ice-breaking, rushed to 
the site about 300 miles east of northern Greenland. It reached the area after 
about four hours to begin rescue work. Soviet ships arrived later to continue 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although reports of the number of people aboard the liner varied, the agency 
that chartered the vessel said there were 953 aboard -- 575 passengers and 378 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
Johannes Zurnieden, manager of the Phoenix-Flugreisen tourist agency in West 
Germany, said all but 16 of the passengers were West Germans. The others 
included Austrian, Swiss, Italian, British, Dutch and Swedish passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clambered Into Lifeboats 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, about 350 passengers clambered into lifeboats and some were 
taken to ice floes before being plucked to safety by Norwegian and Soviet 
helicopters. They later were moved onto a Norwegian rescue vessel in the 
Barents Sea, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 200 passengers who had remained aboard the 25,000-ton vessel were 
evacuated and picked up by the Senja. 
</P>
<P>
The captain of the Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said the Maxim Gorky had two gashes 
in the starboard hull, one measuring 30 inches by 8 feet and the other 2 inches 
by 19 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Kleiven said that after his ship's arrival, two of the Senja's pumps were taken 
aboard the crippled liner. One pump later broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Divers inspected the gashes, but there was nothing available to plug them with, 
Kleiven said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Finn B. Hansen of the North Norway Rescue Coordination Center said the 
Soviet tugboat Sarja arrived with more pumps and two more vessels steamed 
toward the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to keep it afloat," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the crew managed to stabilize the ship despite the gashes and set 
sail for Barentsburg, 300 miles to the east, trailed by a coast guard ship, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is under control, thanks to comprehensive pumping equipment 
continuously brought to the vessel throughout the day," a coast guard spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky had set out June 11 from Bremerhaven, West Germany, sailed to 
Iceland and, then, while sailing around the Spitsbergen island chain on its way 
to Norway, struck the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute sends out weekly ice charts of the area, 
but the situation changes too quickly to be dependable for navigation, the 
Norwegian news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was reportedly foggy at the time of the accident, it was not fully 
dark because the area around the Arctic Circle is light nearly 24 hours a day 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven years ago, on April 14, 1912, the British luxury liner Titanic 
hit an iceberg just south of Newfoundland on its maiden voyage. Of 2,224 people 
aboard, 1,513 died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fared Better 
</P>
<P>
Steinar Breivik at the Bodoe Rescue Center said the Maxim Gorky fared better 
because damage to the Titanic was apparently much worse and because the Soviet 
vessel "received pumping equipment within a few hours, both from land and from 
other ships." 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky was built in West Germany in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have been involved in the cruise business for foreigners for about 
15 years. The Soviet merchant fleet began expanding passenger liners for the 
cruise trade as well as purchasing new ships during the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The collision with the iceberg is the latest disaster or near-disaster reported 
openly under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist policy of 
disclosure of events. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst Soviet shipping disaster, the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov was 
rammed by a grain freighter in the Black Sea in August, 1986, killing 398 of 
1,236 people aboard.

   Europe and the United States plan to send a space
probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one
with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space
Agency announced Friday.
   The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas-shrouded satellite
would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to
test soil from the mysterious moon.
   The mission, to be called the Cassini-Titan probe, was chosen
from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday
and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.
   NASA, however, still is seeking official approval for the $550
million project. It is expected to ask Congress for some funding
during the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, NASA spokesman
Charles Redmond said in Washington.
   Redmond said he expects the Europeans would contribute about $100
million to $150 million. They proposed paying for at least one major
instrument system, helping to pay for some others and providing
propulsion components.
   The project is named after 17th-century Italian astronomer
Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
   Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a thick,
organic-rich nitrogen atmosphere. The surface temperature is about
minus 354 degrees.
   Scientists believe that the chemical processes in Titan's
atmosphere may resemble those at work on the primitive Earth before
the origin of life.
   Cassini-Titan is to be launched in April 1996 by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and should arrive in the Saturn
system in October 2002, the European Space Agency said in a
statement.
   Saturn and its system of rings and satellites were briefly
encountered in 1980-81 during the United States' Voyager 1 and 2
missions.
   The Cassini-Titan mission will place around Saturn a NASA-built
orbiter that will send an European-built probe into Titan's
atmosphere. The probe is to slow down to subsonic speeds when it
gets within 110 miles of the moon.
   The probe is named Huygens, after the Dutch astronomer and
physicist Christian Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1656.
   A parachute system will be deployed to allow a slow descent to
the surface of Titan, which some scientists say is covered by ethane
and methane lakes or oceans. The low-velocity impact may be soft
enough to allow analysis of a surface sample before the probe dies,
the European Space Agency said.
   During the descent of Huygens, the orbiter will be used as a
radio relay station to transmit the probe's data to Earth. After
Huygen's mission, the Cassini orbiter is to circle Saturn for four
years at an altitude of only 620 miles.

NASA SEEKS CLUES TO LIFE IN THE EARTH'S BACK YARD

Each July and August, blue ice lakes form on the surface of glaciers near the 
U.S. research station at Sondre Stromfjord in southern Greenland. Belying the 
pristine Greenland air and the clean-swept beauty of the glaciers, the bottoms 
of the lakes are covered with black organic goo. 
</P>
<P>
The tar is not the residue of an oil spill, nor is it any other detritus of 
civilization. It is comet dust, a melange of rock and organic materials formed 
between the planets, and between stars, and dating back perhaps to the 
formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The dust falls to Earth continually -- and on other planets and moons as well 
-- becoming buried in the snow and ice. In the arctic regions, it is 
concentrated by the summer melt and then settles on lake bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Earth's organic chemicals -- the stuff of life -- represent only a fraction of 
the total found throughout the solar system. In fact, "the universe is awash in 
organic chemicals" like those from which life evolved on Earth, said astronomer 
Dale Cruikshank of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the apparent ease with which life was created on Earth, some 
researchers believe life could have arisen elsewhere in the solar system as 
well: on the surface of Mars, when water flowed freely there, or in the frozen 
oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the launch of the Magellan probe to Venus in May and next month's 
launch of Galileo to Jupiter, NASA has begun a new series of exploratory 
missions to Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, its satellite Titan and at least two 
comets. In addition to evidence about the origin of the solar system, they hope 
to discover primitive forms of life that are no longer present on Earth itself, 
as well as other evidence that would illuminate the origin of life. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, researchers hope that information gained from those missions 
will shed light on how primitive organic molecules were organized into the more 
complex forms that are now characteristic of life. 
</P>
<P>
"The clues to life's origin . . . are going to be found elsewhere in the solar 
system," said Lynn Griffiths, head of NASA's exobiology program, which studies 
life off the Earth. "Exobiology has matured quite a bit in the last 20 years 
and is now in its active young adulthood," added cosmologist Harold P. Klein of 
the University of Santa Clara. "We have unlimited challenges. Unfortunately, at 
the present we have only limited opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers gathered recently in Sunnyvale for a NASA-sponsored conference to 
discuss the best places to look for life off the Earth. They concluded that a 
number of tempting targets exist within the solar system but that undoubtedly 
the chances of finding life are rather small. Many would be happy to find 
fossils of life that had once existed elsewhere, but others argue that more 
clear-cut evidence -- including living organisms -- is necessary to convince 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Exobiologists once had high hopes for Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, and 
were crushed when the Mariner probes produced no evidence of life. But they 
have been reassessing what they know about the Red Planet and now think that 
perhaps the probe simply wasn't looking in the right place. "Mars is still the 
best candidate for life in the solar system," said astrophysicist Christopher 
McKay of the Ames lab. 
</P>
<P>
The chief factor militating against life existing on Mars, which is about half 
the size of Earth, is the small amount of water that exists there, either 
frozen at the poles in winter or vaporized in summer. The fact that water is 
not present in liquid form is "a serious problem for contemplating life on 
Mars," McKay said, "but it hasn't always been that way." 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of Mars show large areas, such as Valles Marinaris and Playa Lake, 
that look as though they were shaped by water. Valles Marinaris, for example, 
has a delicate surface tracery of small channels that could have been formed by 
the slow flow of water on the surface, "perhaps rain finding a collection 
area," McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
This and other evidence suggest that during the period from 4.5 billion to 3.5 
billion years ago Mars had a relatively thick atmosphere, much larger 
quantities of water and a surface temperature above freezing. "If life did 
exist then, there could be a record," said Glenn Carle, chief of NASA's Solar 
System Exploration Branch. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to know is: If life didn't evolve there, why not?" McKay 
said. If life didn't evolve on Mars, "there is something wrong with our 
understanding of Mars or our paradigm for the evolution of life on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missions to Mars 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and the United States are discussing manned missions to the 
Red Planet. McKay and others are urging that any landings be made in the polar 
regions near the ice caps or in regions where there is evidence of past water 
flow because that is where evidence of life is most likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
A more remote possibility for life is Venus, the second planet from the sun. 
The planet, which is about the size of Earth, has an average surface 
temperature of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, an atmosphere that is 95 times as 
dense as Earth's and virtually no water. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of extant life can be ruled out by these data," astrophysicist Larry 
Colin of San Jose State said. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Mars, Venus could have been more hospitable to life early in its 
history when the sun was not putting out as much radiation as it does now. One 
key piece of evidence favoring a clement early Venus are mass spectrometer 
measurements made by the Pioneer Venus spacecraft of the ratio of deuterium to 
hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. Deuterium is a rare heavy isotope of 
hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
The deuterium/hydrogen ratio on Venus is about 100 times as great as Earth's. 
Because water containing deuterium is heavier than normal water and thus 
evaporates more slowly, this ratio indicates that Venus probably had 
"significant amounts of water," Colin said. As the planet warmed up, that water 
eventually rose into the upper atmosphere, where it was broken apart by 
sunlight, leaving behind the heavier deuterium as much of the lighter hydrogen 
escaped into space. 
</P>
<P>
Venus could have had oceans during this period, and life could have gotten 
started, only to die out as the planet heated up, astrophysicist James Kasting 
of Ames said. Traces of life could still remain, he said. It may be very 
difficult to locate such evidence, however, because of Venus' hostile 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venus' Past 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope to learn much more about Venus' past from the Magellan probe, 
which is scheduled to reach the "Veiled Planet" Aug. 10, 1990. The probe will 
use sophisticated radar imaging to map at least 80% of the planet's surface, a 
process that is expected to shed light on its geological history and the origin 
of the "runaway greenhouse effect" that caused its high surface temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most tantalizing object in the solar system is Europa, a Jovian 
moon slightly larger than Earth's moon. Voyager 2 pictures show that its 
surface is bright, smooth and highly fractured "like sea ice," astronomer Steve 
Squyres of Cornell University said. 
</P>
<P>
The whole surface of Europa has only about five craters, even though it has 
presumably been subject to the same intense bombardment that has left the 
Earth's moon covered with craters. Researchers thus believe that Europa has 
continuing geological activity that obliterates the craters. 
</P>
<P>
About 7% of the mass of Europa is water, he said, and the most likely 
explanation for the surface features is that the moon's surface is covered by 
an ocean of liquid water topped with a thick layer of ice. The water is 
presumably kept liquid by tidal heating, a continual compression and relaxation 
of the moon caused by Jupiter's massive gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, according to biochemist John Oro of the University of Houston, 
"there is more organic material on Europa than in the terrestrial biosphere," 
as well as other elements, like phosphorus, that are crucial to life. "And if 
there is liquid water, then Europa has potential hot spots" similar to thermal 
vents in the Earth's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
His conclusion: "Could terrestrial life grow there? My answer is yes. We 
definitely need a close flyby and landing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plans for Mission 
</P>
<P>
No such missions are planned at the moment, however, largely because of the 
difficulty of landing amid Jupiter's massive gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility, less likely but more accessible, is Titan, the largest 
moon of Saturn, said Thomas Scattergood of the State University of New York at 
Stony Brook. Titan, which is slightly larger than the Earth's moon, looks like 
"a featureless billiard ball" because its extensive atmosphere hides its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers have never seen the surface of Titan, Scattergood 
speculated that it is an ethane ocean containing both water-ice and frozen 
carbon dioxide. Large numbers of organic compounds could be formed from these 
raw materials through the action of sunlight, lightning and energetic particles 
trapped by Saturn's magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Titan can accommodate life will depend on how much water is 
present, he said. But "it looks like there is interesting organic chemistry 
taking place there even today," NASA's Carle added. 
</P>
<P>
Exobiologists are also interested in studying asteroids and comets, not because 
they think life might exist there but because these celestial bodies contain 
large amounts of organic chemicals and are presumably the source of most of the 
carbon-containing compounds now on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Asteroids, which early astronomers called the "vermin of the skies" because of 
their misleading motion, come in two categories, black and lighter, NASA's 
Cruikshank said. The black material, he said, is very much like kerogen, the 
complex organic material found in oil shale. The lighter material is made up of 
less complex organic substances. 
</P>
<P>
The asteroids and meteorites, added geochemist John Kerridge of UCLA, "are the 
only materials we have that date from the beginnings of the solar system. . . . 
Studies of carbon-containing meteorites that have fallen to Earth, called 
carbonaceous chondrites, have shown the presence of more than 400 different 
compounds, including most of the chemicals that are involved in life processes. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of such meteorites allow researchers to determine what kinds of 
chemicals were present on Earth before life arose, and may lead to new insights 
into the events that sparked life's formation. Researchers are thus eager to 
have more samples. Kerridge added: "We pray for more carbonaceous chondrite 
falls." 
</P>
<P>
Exobiologists may be able to get more information about life's origin without 
waiting around for more meteorites, as NASA begins sending more probes out into 
the solar system after an 11-year hiatus. "The queen is ready to give us more 
ships," Carle said. 
</P>
<P>
The Magellan mission that will perform radar mapping of Venus was launched from 
the space shuttle Atlantis in May, and the Galileo spacecraft to Jupiter is 
scheduled to be launched Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has also tentatively approved two other deep-space missions, Titan-Cassini 
and the Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby (CRAF). Both spacecraft, designed 
at JPL, would use versions of the successful Mariner Mark II spacecraft that 
would be outfitted with new instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan-Cassini probe, named after the 17th-Century French- 
</P>
<P>
Italian astronomer who discovered several of Saturn's moons, would be launched 
from an expendable rocket in April, 1996. The following March, it would have a 
close flyby of asteroid Maja. It would swing by Jupiter in February, 2000, for 
a gravitational boost and reach Saturn in October, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
The orbiter will perform radar mapping of both Saturn and Titan, identifying 
objects as small as 200 yards in diameter. It will occasionally fly through the 
upper reaches of Titan's atmosphere and sample it, and will also send a probe 
to the moon's surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help on Financing 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the European Space Agency agreed to build the Titan probe and 
help finance the mission. NASA has not yet received funding from Congress for 
the $550-million mission but is seeking $40 million for the next fiscal year to 
begin construction of the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The CRAF mission, which is scheduled for launch in August, 1995, would 
intercept comet Kopff on Aug. 14, 2000, Marcia M. Neugebauer of JPL said. 
Unlike the flights to Halley's comet, which flew past it at high speed, CRAF 
will rendezvous with Kopff 850 days before its nearest approach to the sun and 
accompany it through its orbit, measuring its output of gases and dust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tests on Comet 
</P>
<P>
After it has collected data for a year, CRAF will launch a 4.5-foot-long, golf 
tee-shaped penetrator that will sink at least 1 1/2 feet into the comet, 
measuring its strength, density, temperature and composition. 
</P>
<P>
On its way to the comet, CRAF will fly by an asteroid named Hamburga. "Perhaps 
we can get McDonald's to sponsor the mission," Neugebauer said. The craft will 
survey the asteroid's size, shape and rotation and gather information about its 
chemical composition. 
</P>
<P>
The CRAF mission has not yet been approved by NASA. Its cost would be about the 
same as Titan-Cassini.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Titanic Memories: Letter From an 11-Year-Old </HL>
<AUTHOR> Nicholas King, Falls Church, Va. </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   The folded sheet of pale gray writing paper bore the red-and-white pennant of the White Star Line over the words, in dark blue, "On board R.M.S. 'Titanic,'" and the date was April 10, 1912. 

   Below, the space was filled with a child's loops and swoops and misspellings in pencil. 
"Dear Lusia," it began -- the writer meant Louisa -- and it went on to describe "the biggest ship in the world, with its gymnasium, its swimming pool and its Turkish baths." 

   Then the 11-year-old girl who wrote it told how the Titanic, outward bound from its berth in Southampton on its maiden voyage to New York, ran afoul of the cables of another ship, the Olympic. 
It soon got clear and proceeded into the English Channel. 
"It's quite calm now," she wrote innocently, "No one has been sick so far." 

   The letter belongs to Eileen Schefer, a distinguished and self-possessed 86-year-old Englishwoman who has lived here for many years, the widow of retired diplomat and school director Edward Schefer. 
Her abode is a yellow-and-white farmhouse, an anachronism in this densely populated Washington suburb, set in an acre of old trees and enclosed by a wooden paddock fence and beyond it by rows of small brick dwellings in geometric plots. 
The house is filled with graceful Victorian furniture and family portraits in gilt oval frames, as remote from its surroundings as the Titanic would be from the life of the ocean today. 

   But there seems to be a mystery. 
The lady is a survivor of the Titanic, of which there were some and are now still a few. 
But who ever saw a letter from on board that survived? 
Women and children may have been rescued, but no one ever heard of a mail sack being dumped into the life boats. 
How did Mrs. Schefer come to be sitting in her house in Falls Church with the letter she wrote 76 years ago in her hand? 

   What happened was that the letter was taken off the Titanic at the Irish port of Cobh or Queenstown, where transatlantic liners used to stop for that purpose. 
Eileen Lenox-Conyngham, as she then was, and her mother, an aunt and her younger brother, Dennis, went on to France, where they disembarked at Cherbourg, the traditional port of call for British liners, five hours after they left Southampton. 

   Because the Lenox-Conynghams had no luggage to unpack or worry about other than what was needed for a brief vacation, they had time to roam over the ship, hence Eileen's vivid memory of it. 
"The maiden-voyage flowers were beautiful; The officers and deckhands very kind to us." 

   A few days later, after the family visited Chartres, Eileen was horrified, on her arrival in Paris, to see huge headlines announcing the fateful news. 
"Le Roi des Vaissaux Blesse a Mort" said one of them -- "The Monarch of Ships Mortally Wounded." 

   The Louisa of the letter was the family's young nursery maid in their home in Suffolk, where the Rev. George Lenox-Conyngham, Eileen's father, had a parish. 
Louisa later married the gardener, and it was their daughter, Patricia Kent, now 62 and a widow too, who found the long-forgotten document among some family papers. 
She was told it was valuable -- it was indeed: It sold at auction last fall for $1,700 and was bought on Mrs. Schefer's behalf by her nephew. 
She and her son wonder if it should not be framed in double glass (it is temporarily safe in an acetate folder) so the whole thing can be seen. 

   Mrs. Schefer has been in touch with the Titanic Historical Society, which is planning a reunion of survivors in Boston in September. 
The society has invited her and her son Anton to be present and they are looking forward to it. 

   There is one question left: Why did the Lenox-Conynghams embark on such an enormous vessel as the Titanic merely to cross the Channel? 
"Well you see," Mrs. Schefer says, "we were very poor sailors and easily got seasick. 
My father thought that if only the ship were big enough we couldn't have too rough a trip."

<HEAD>Seized Research Vessel Likely To be Returned to Owners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research vessel that was part of the Titanic
exploration, seized under the government's ``zero-tolerance''
policy after a small amount of marijuana was found, will probably
be returned to its owners, officials say.
   Atlantis II was seized here Wednesday after a routine inspection
turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of
one of the ship's 25 crew members, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman
said Thursday.
   Spokesman Mike Fleming said it was clear the 210-foot vessel's
owners, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole,
Mass., ``were innocent parties. They've been extremely cooperative
in this matter.''
   Crew member Richard Morris, 27, of Buzzards Bay, Mass., pleaded
guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of drug possession, said
Fleming. Morris was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $100.
   The vessel's owners are forwarding a letter to Customs
supporting the anti-drug effort and assuring officials they intend
to tighten security aboard the ship, Fleming said.
   ``Once we receive their agreement and their letter outlining the
procedures they will take, then we fully intend to return the
Atlantis II to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,'' he said.
   Atlantis II and its contents, including a three-person research
submarine named Alvin, are worth $80 million, Fleming said.
   Atlantis II arrived in San Diego Wednesday from Guatemala, where
it had stopped for supplies after geological and biological
research work near the Galapagos Islands, said Derek Spencer, the
institution's director of research.
   The seizure shocked the scientific community at Woods Hole,
where the ship is based, said Spencer.
   Construction of Atlantis II and Alvin was substantially funded
by federal research agencies, Spencer said. He noted that the
25-foot Alvin is owned by the Navy.
   Scientists aboard Atlantis II used Alvin in 1986 to explore and
photograph the North Atlantic site where the Titanic lies.
   The luxury liner went down 74 years ago after striking an
iceberg only five days into its maiden voyage. More than 1,500
people died. Scientists found the Titanic in September 1985 on a
joint U.S.-French expedition.
   At least 22 vessels have been seized across the country since
the zero-tolerance policy went into effect.

<HEAD>Underwater Robot Sill Sunken But $7 Million Science Project Stays

   Jason, the million-dollar submersible robot, was
still missing at sea Friday but its disappearance failed to sink a
$7 million high school science project.
   ``Jason's still down there, but we're optimistic,'' said Nancy
Green of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, home base to the
propeller-driven remote-control robot sunk to the bottom of the
Mediterranean Sea.
   More than 250,000 students in 13 cities in the United States and
Canada were boning up on plate tectonics and underwater volcanoes
in preparation for the start Monday of a massive satellite science
project gone slightly awry.
   On Wednesday, museums across North America were hooked up live
via satellite with the Star Hercules, a marine exploration ship
anchored over the ancient ruins of a sunken Roman trading ship off
the coast.
   As about 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians
watched, marine biologists began lowering the 7-foot-long robot and
its 8,000-pound mobile garage, Argo, into the ocean for a test run.
The footage was to be viewed by thousands of students during a
two-week period.
   All of a sudden, the live cameras focused in on a group of crew
members holding the severed cable that once had been Jason's
lifeline.
   In a flash, the horrible truth emerged: the million dollar robot
whose older brother nosed among the Titanic's ruins had sunk 2,100
feet to the soft, silty ocean floor.
   Green said a second consecutive day of churning seas and high
winds prevented Dr. Robert Ballard and his team of marine explorers
from sending down a second submersible to rescue its errant
predecessor.
   Paul Fontaine, coordinator for the project at Boston's Museum of
Science, said if necessary a slightly less sophisticated backup
would be used and the show would go on despite Jason's predicament.
   ``The kids won't be disappointed,'' he said. ``Even if they
can't pick him up before the project gets going, they'll just go
back and get Jason later.''
   Fontaine said the project, whose sponsors include Turner, Woods
Hole, Electronic Data Systems and the National Geographic Society,
would go on as scheduled between May 1-14.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

<HEAD>Powerful Titan 4 Rocket Boosts Military Satellite on Maiden Launch</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD payload capacity of space shuttle
and Saturn 5, ADD current missile-warning time, quote from Air Force. No

<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Titan 4, America's newest, most
powerful rocket, blasted off on its maiden flight today, reportedly
sending into space a $180 million satellite designed to provide
instant alert of a missile attack.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, a $45 million satellite
booster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close to
half a billion dollars.
   The 20-story-tall booster barreled off its launch pad at 9:18
a.m. and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twin
solid-fuel boosters as it dashed out over the Atlantic Ocean.
   Ten minutes after liftoff, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force
launch commentator, reported the rocket had successfully drilled its
secret payload into space.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because its
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster, which will
give us assured access to space for our critical heavy national
security payloads,'' Rand said.
   The Titan 4 will be the workhorse as the Pentagon assembles a
stable of rockets to solve a post-Challenger crisis that has left
about 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloads
languishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle.
   The Titan 4 can hoist 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150 to
300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to stationary orbits
23,000 miles up. It replaces the Titan 34D booster, only one of
which remains to be launched.
   The United States once had a more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5
that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon, but it was discontinued
after the lunar program. It could send a 240,000-pound payload into
orbit.
   The space shuttle, by comparison, can lift 55,000 pounds into
orbit.
   The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's largest rocket, has
nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   The Air Force said only that the big rocket was boosting a
classified payload.
   However, it has been widely reported that the rocket carried an
advanced missile warning satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific Oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   ``That would give bombers enough time to become airborne, enough
time to mobilize our own nuclear forces and enough time to get the
president into an airborne command post,'' Pike said.
   The new satellite offers about the same warning time as older
ones, but without such errors as mistaking sunlight glinting off
clouds for missile exhaust, Pike said.
   The 2{-ton satellite also will provide intelligence on routine
Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and will be able to detect
the exhaust heat from military aircraft when they fly with their
afterburners on for extra speed.
   Pike said nine of the new satellites will be launched over the
next several years into orbits 22,300 miles high to replace aging,
earlier models.
   The first of the new rockets had waited a long time for its
maiden flight. It was moved to the launch pad more than a year ago,
on May 15, 1988, to be readied for a liftoff last October. But
technical problems caused delay after delay, stretching into months
and adding millions of dollars to the cost.
   Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace is building 23 Titan 4s for the
Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two are negotiating another contract
for an additional 26 rockets.
   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger exploded in 1986 that
they were relying too heavily on the space shuttle for vital
military payloads. They more than doubled the number of Titan 4s on
order and authorized development of two new smaller rockets, the
Delta 2 and Atlas 2.
   The first two Delta 2's launched navigation satellites in
February and on Saturday.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope To Retrieve Sunken Mercury Space Capsule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of researchers is trying to raise $1.4
million to retrieve a 1961 Project Mercury space capsule from its
resting place deep in the Atlantic Ocean off Grand Bahama Island.
   Astronaut Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, who was later killed with two
other astronauts when the Apollo 1 capsule caught fire in 1967, was
on board the Mercury capsule, which sank after splashdown. Some
accounts say Grissom caused the capsule to sink by detonating
explosive charges prematurely.
   ``There's a piece of American space history three miles down out
there, and we believe we can locate it _ and if it can be located,
then it can be recovered,'' said Curt Newport, who is leading the
search for Liberty Bell 7.
   Side-scan sonar devices, similar to those employed in 1985 to
locate the luxury liner Titanic at a depth of 2{ miles, would be
used to hunt for Liberty Bell 7, Newport said.
   Once the capsule was found, he said, a manned submersible vessel
would be used to attach a cable to the one-ton spaceship and reel
it to the surface.
   So far, however, there are no sponsors for the project.
   ``When I started looking into this back in late 1984, I always
thought that the most difficult part would be to convince people
that it could be recovered,'' Newport said. ``Now I'm finding that
the most difficult part is to locate someone willing to pay for
it.''
   Newport said the project has the backing of former astronaut
Thomas Stafford. Gregg Linebaugh, an analyst with the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Maryland, is a project partner, Newport said.
   The July 21, 1961, sub-orbital flight splashed down just 15
minutes after liftoff in the Atlantic Ocean about 300 miles
southeast of Cape Canaveral.
   A Navy helicopter was supposed to hook onto the capsule and lift
it a few feet above the water so Grissom could safely exit from the
side escape.
   As the chopper hovered overhead, however, explosive charges
mounted on the hatch apparently detonated prematurely _ allowing
the capsule to fill with water. Grissom managed to swim out before
the capsule sank.
   Some accounts, including one in the novel and movie ``The Right
Stuff,'' suggest Grissom panicked and blew the hatch too soon. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, however, absolved
Grissom of blame.
   Grissom was one of the seven original Mercury astronauts and the
second American to roar into space atop an 85-foot Redstone rocket.
   Newport said any chance of establishing what really happened
depends on finding the hatch door, where the explosives' detonator
was mounted. But the findings might be inconclusive, he said,
because the detonator switch could have been flipped by some force
other than Grissom, such as a powerful vacuum created during
re-entry.
   Newport, who lives in Annapolis, Md., and works for a NASA
subcontractor helping design America's first space station, said he
doubts that any significant flight data might be aboard. But
researchers believe it's possible that on-board cameras might have
film that could be developed if the equipment survived the
underwater pressures.

The accident involving the submarine, believed to be the only one of its kind, 
may provide an intelligence bonanza for the United States and its allies if 
reconnaissance ships, aircraft or satellites were able to take detailed, 
close-up photographs of the rare craft as it surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Defense Ministry said that Soviet ships and aircraft were in the 
area where the sub was lost, in international waters off Spitsbergen Island 
near the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Norwegian military aircraft had flown over the area, about 
300 miles from North Cape on the Norwegian mainland, and had seen the submarine 
ablaze. Officials said the fire appeared to be concentrated in the stern, or 
rear, of the vessel, where water distillation equipment and propulsion 
machinery are housed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have observed bodies," Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told 
NTB. "We do not yet have an exact figure." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on Britain's Independent Television News, Norwegian 
Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Gullow Gjeseth said that in a flight over the 
submarine, "I saw at the time two dinghies, with the personnel in one dinghy. 
We saw also a Soviet merchant ship in the area and we know also Soviet aircraft 
have been over the area." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have built only one submarine of this type, according to "Jane's 
Fighting Ships," the authoritative British reference book on the world's 
navies. U.S. naval intelligence analysts said it was built as a platform for 
experiments in submarine design, and may have special coatings and a unique 
propulsion system. The sub's design reduces both the turbulence and noise that 
the boat creates when it is moving, making it harder to locate in the 
cat-and-mouse game that U.S. and Soviet submarines play undersea. 
</P>
<P>
The 361-foot-long vessel was launched at Severodvinsk in May, 1983. It was 
powered by twin, liquid-metal-cooled nuclear reactors and had an estimated top 
speed of 38 knots. 
</P>
<P>
The double-hulled ship was probably made of titanium for weight and noise 
reduction, according to Jane's. Norman Polmar, an independent American naval 
analyst, said the submarine could have been carrying as many as six 
nuclear-tipped torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Information Available 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had little 
information on the incident Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we have no details. 
We understand there has been a loss of life but we can't confirm how many," 
Fitzwater said. "We express the sympathy of the United States government to the 
Soviet government for any loss of life involved." President Bush had been 
notified of the accident, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the sinking in the Norwegian Sea is the site of many naval 
exercises by both Eastern and Western forces and is considered a potential 
battleground in the event of a large-scale conflict. Western forces practice 
keeping Soviet submarines away from Atlantic shipping lanes, while Soviet 
vessels patrol there to keep track of Western ships. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said that before sinking, the submarine could have released its 
ballast, causing the ship to pop up high on the surface of the ocean, exposing 
some of the sub's underside. 
</P>
<P>
"This really could be an intelligence coup," said one American naval analyst. 
When a disabled Soviet Victor-class submarine surfaced off Newport, R.I., in 
the mid-1980s, analysts reaped a harvest of valuable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But the accident poses potentially severe environmental hazards as well. 
Previous submarine accidents have resulted in release of radiation, and in 1961 
members of a Soviet submarine crew died of radiation poisoning after an 
accident in the Baltic, according to recently declassified CIA documents. 
</P>
<P>
John Holdren, professor of energy and resources at UC Berkeley and an expert on 
nuclear issues who has served as an adviser to the Department of Energy, said 
that if radiation leaked from the vessel's reactors from the sea bottom, not 
much would reach the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean and the chemicals naturally occurring in it have a diluting effect on 
radiation, he said. The submarine would probably come to rest so far down that 
little radiation is likely to reach the surface or contaminate edible fish, 
which generally inhabit waters less deep. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . One could imagine an effect on fisheries," Holdren said, "but in 
previous nuclear submarine accidents there has not been enough damage to the 
reactor to produce a big effect." 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident is the fifth known sinking of a Soviet nuclear-powered 
submarine. A Soviet Yankee-class ballistic missile sub sank 600 miles east of 
Bermuda in 1986. A Charlie-class cruise-missile submarines went down off 
Kamchatka Peninsula in 1983. And in 1970, a November-class torpedo-attack 
submarine sank off the Atlantic coast of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the best-known incident, the forward section of a Soviet Golf-class 
submarine that had sunk northwest of Hawaii in 1968 was recovered from the 
seabed in 1974 by the American salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. nuclear submarines have been lost at sea -- the Thresher off the U.S. 
East Coast in 1963 with the loss of 129 lives, and the Scorpion off the Azores 
Islands in 1968, with 99 men killed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, then-Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. told reporters, "We do have 
firm evidence that their (Soviet) standards of safety -- and crew safety -- are 
far lower than ours in nuclear power plants."

<HEAD>NTSB Blames Deaths on Lack of Coast Guard Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators are blaming the
boat accident deaths of four people in Oregon last year on the
Coast Guard's failure to require lifeboats and a signal beacon on
the vessel that carried them.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has tried for years to
get the Coast Guard to toughen requirements for an estimated 4,700
small commercial vessels that are equipped to carry 300,000
passengers.
   ``There has been a long, documented absence of regulatory
action,'' said board member Jim Burnett.
   The NTSB's 3-0 decision Tuesday was the first time it has said
the service's lack of regulations contributed to deaths in an ocean
accident. The Sept. 15, 1988, incident off the coast of Oregon
involved the sinking of the Cougar, a 46-foot vessel used to carry
passengers on a fishing trip.
   After the boat took on water and sank, passengers and crew were
left in the cold Pacific Ocean, clinging to float devices and
debris, for 18 hours as searchers tried to locate them. The
captain, a deckhand and two passengers died. A ship's mate and four
other passengers survived.
   The last victim drowned 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued
the others about 35 miles out into the ocean, west of Depoe Bay,
investigators said.
   The board also blamed the Coast Guard for failing during
inspections to confirm the watertightness of hatchcovers on boat's
deck.
   Its report said the probable cause of the accident was the
captain's failure to ensure that his hatchcovers were watertight,
that the bilge pump was operating properly and that rubber flaps
designed to let water flow off the deck were correctly installed.
The captain was not identified in the report.
   The flaps were on the wrong side, preventing water from flowing
off the deck, investigators said. The ship sank in moderately heavy
seas while returning from a fishing trip, after its crew and
passengers tried for 90 minutes to remove water with buckets.
   The board for years has recommended that the Coast Guard require
all passenger boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all
passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that
emergency position indicating radio beacons, or EPRIBs, be carried
on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers.
   In the last five years, the board has investigated five
passenger vessel accidents, including two collisions, one fire, one
capsizing and one grounding. In each case, Coast Guard survival
craft requirements were found inadequate, but there has been no
change in the regulations.
   The board recommended that the Coast Guard require that within
five years all flotation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced
by lifeboats, life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people
out of the water.
   Passengers using flotation devices remain in the water where
they can suffer from a rapid loss of body heat, or hypothermia.
   The board also advised the Coast Guard to improve its testing
rules and procedures and require all passenger vessel operators to
file sailing plans before they set out.

<HEAD>Antarctic Icebergs Increasing With Warming Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth's slowly rising temperature may be
to blame for the recent increase in icebergs breaking off from
Antarctica, government ice specialists say.
   They can't be sure yet, but officials of the Navy-NOAA Joint Ice
Center note that as the global temperature has increased, so have
the size and number of icebergs.
   ``An abnormally high amount of ice shelf calving is occurring in
Antarctica,'' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
meteorologist Glenn Rutledge said Thursday.
   Increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the
atmosphere over the last century or so have been associated with
rising temperatures around the world.
   Some scientists believe that the temperature increase, amounting
to one or two degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, could lead to
major climate changes including melting the ice in the polar
regions.
   This could cause a rise in the ocean level around the world and
cause major changes in weather patterns, climatologists have warned.
   ``The poles are sensitive indicators of change'' in the Earth's
climate, Rutledge said.
   But while the increase in icebergs may be a result of the rising
temperature, there isn't yet enough information to be certain, said
Russell Koffler, who heads the satellite services at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``We have only 12 years of data,'' added Rutledge. ``That is
nothing in the geological bucket.''
   But he noted that both abnormally large icebergs and an
increasing number of bergs have been breaking loose in the last
year or two.
   Whether this will be a continuing trend he declined to forecast,
saying ``the Earth, as a system, is difficult to predict.''
   Rutledge said the iceberg increase was notable in the Antarctic
area. It's harder to determine if more bergs are arising in the
arctic, where they tend to be smaller and larger in number anyway,
he said.
   But in Antarctica two exceptional iceberge have broken loose in
the last two years.
   Last year a berg called B-9 broke off the Ross ice shelf.
Measuring 86 miles by 23 miles, B-9 covered 1,978 square miles,
nearly as big as Delaware.
   At 800 feet thick, it contains enough water to supply Los
Angeles for 700 years, said Rutledge. And loose in the ocean it
could be a serious hazard to shipping.
   B-9 has run aground on an underwater mountain, he said, but is
likely to break free eventually, and could take from two to seven
years to melt, he said.
   An even larger iceberg broke free from the other side of
Antarctica in 1986, Rutledge added, but that has since split into
pieces, leaving B-9 as the largest floating mass of ice.
   Other smaller bergs have broken free also, though numbers were
not available. Indeed, many bergs are too small to register on the
satellites used to watch them, which track items about a half-mile
across and larger.
   Navy Commander Donald Hinson, director of the Joint Ice Center,
said that within a few years improved satellites will be in place
to allow smaller bergs to be followed.
   The Center is responsible for monitoring ice conditions in the
Great Lakes and most of the oceans of the world. The lone exception
is the North Atlantic, where bergs are tracked by the International
Ice Patrol, a Coast Guard operation set up in 1912 following the
Titanic disaster. The two groups share data.

<HEAD>Greenpeace Reports Dozens of Nuclear Weapons, Reactors Lost on Ocean
Floor</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DONNA CASSATA</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 50 nuclear weapons and nine nuclear
reactors, the products of U.S. and Soviet naval accidents since
World War II, are lost on the ocean floor, Greenpeace officials
said Tuesday.
   ``There are more likely more Soviet weapons and reactors on the
bottom of the ocean,'' said William M. Arkin, co-author of the
report by the Greenpeace environmental group, which favors
nuclear-free seas, and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal
research group.
   Using data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the
groups found that more than 2,000 major peacetime naval accidents
have occurred since 1945 resulting in some 2,800 deaths. The
accidents ranged from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to
minor collisions and fires that left little damage and some
injuries.
   The researchers omitted incidents that occurred during the
Vietnam and Korean Wars and in the Persian Gulf during the
Iran-Iraq war, Arkin said.
   Since World War II, 10 U.S. and Soviet accidents and a decision
by the United States to intentionally scuttle one reactor, have
left 50 sunken warheads and nine reactors on the ocean floor.
Forty-three of the 50 warheads and six of the nine reactors are
Soviet.
   The report specifically details 1,276 accidents, including the
Soviet Mike-class submarine that sank in the Norwegian Sea on April
7 with two nuclear tipped torpedoes and two nuclear reactors aboard.
   The most serious incident apparently was the sinking of a Soviet
Yankee-class submarine with 32 nuclear warheads and two nuclear
torpedoes aboard. The sinking occurred 600 miles northeast of
Bermuda on Oct. 6, 1986.
   But Arkin said the number of nuclear weapons on the ocean floor
may be higher because ``we are ascribing only two nuclear torpedoes
to each Soviet submarine. They could, of course, have more.''
   Arkin said researchers received no information from the Soviet
Union for their study and when ``we asked the (U.S.) intelligence
community to provide us with their analysis of Soviet accidents,
they declined to do so on the basis of security.''
   The report found that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraft
carriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142
minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels.
   Seventy-five incidents involved sinkings. Of these, 27 were
submarines _ five of them Soviet, four American, four French and
three British, as well as submarines from West Germany, Israel,
Pakistan, Peru, Spain and Turkey.
   ``In accident after accident after accident, human failure is
the responsible cause,'' Arkin said.
   In addition, about 30 percent of the 1,276 accidents occurred in
ports, possibly endangering civilians nearby, said Joshua Handler,
the report's other co-author and a researcher with Greenpeace. Of
those accidents, 624 occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, 318 in the
Pacific, 110 in the Mediterranean Sea and 34 in the Indian Ocean.
   Greenpeace earlier revealed information about two U.S. accidents
that received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4
warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga near Okinawa with a hydrogen
bomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknap
came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons.
   Arkin said he suspected that the sinking of a Soviet destroyer
in the Black Sea in 1974 involved nuclear weapons or reactors, but
said that has never been verified. Holding up a Russian-language
version of the study, he said a copy would be delivered to the
Soviet Embassy in Washington.

FT  15 APR 92 / Messages from the Titanic fetch Pounds 95,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S South Kensington raised Pounds 95,000 (against a Pounds 30,000
estimate) for a collection of 448 messages which were sent and received by
the Titanic, the luxury liner which sank in the North Atlantic on her maiden
voyage in 1912.
The top price was the Pounds 66,000 (estimate Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000)
paid by a telephone bidder for 85 signals sent and received by the Titanic
between April 12 and April 15, the morning she hit the iceberg that sank
her.
There was keen bidding for a 10-page letter by Harold Bride, a Marconi
wireless operator on board the ship, describing his experiences, which sold
for Pounds 8,250 (eight times its target). Another item that attracted
interest was a letter put up for sale by Eva Hart, one of the few survivors
still alive, which was given by her father, who went down with the ship, to
her mother, who was saved.
Christie's had been excited by the appearance of a previously unknown album
containing more than 50 drawings by Henry Fuseli. Its excitement was
justified - the album doubled its estimate at almost Pounds 750,000. The top
price was the Pounds 55,000 paid for a pen-and-pencil drawing of 'The
Massacre of the Innocents'.
The morning auction of Old Master drawings did well, totalling Pounds
687,764 and 94 per cent sold. A pastel of Princess Radziwill, painted in
1801 by Louise-Elizabeth Vigee le-Brun, just about doubled its estimate
fetching about Pounds 50,600.
The surprise of the auction was the Pounds 38,500 paid for a study of arms
attributed to the Circle of Michaelangelo. Its estimate had been Pounds
5,000. Obviously, the buyer believed it to be by the the master.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Smolyakova report: "Ecology: "Patches for the </F>
Submarine"] 
  [Text] In accordance with a presidential directive and a 
Russian Federation Government decree a routine expedition to the 
area where the Komsomolets nuclear submarine sank five years ago 
in the Norwegian Sea will go ahead 15 June through 15 August. 
The voyage is to be carried out under the direction of Russia's 
Ministry for Emergency Situations with the participation of a 
number of Russian Academy of Sciences research institutes, the 
"Rubin" maritime technology central design bureau, and the 
Defense Ministry. 
  We would remind you that there are an atomic reactor and two 
torpedoes with nuclear warheads aboard the submarine. The 
torpedoes pose the greatest potential danger: Each of them 
contains 3,200 grams of plutonium-239. Since the nose section 
of the submarine has been damaged seabed currents could destroy 
the torpedoes' casings. And then radioactive contamination of 
the water is inevitable. According to the most pessimistic 
estimates, this could happen in late-1995 or early-1996. And 
although most scientists and specialists do not share such a 
pessimistic forecast, they all agree that it is better to play 
safe. That is the purpose of the expedition. 
  There are three specific tasks -- to hermetically seal the 
nose section of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine using special 
titanium "patches," monitor the radiation and environmental 
situation in the area, investigate the technical state of the 
submarine, and search for the rescue chamber. 
  A collegium session was held at the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations to examine the preparations for the expedition. It 
was acknowledged that the work is proceeding on schedule. The 
titanium "patches" have already been brought aboard the 
oceanographic ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The intention is 
to fit them to the submarine using manned "Mir" underwater craft 
equipped with mechanical arms. In mid-June the ship will leave 
Kaliningrad, go to St. Petersburg and then to Denmark and 
Norway, and start the actual scientific program 1 July in the 
area of the wreck of the Komsomolets. The preparation of a 
warship to ship freight and members of the expedition from 
Murmansk to the work area is being completed. Another 
oceanographic vessel has been chartered in Murmansk as backup 
for the operation. 
  During the coming voyage particular attention will be paid 
to 
environmental monitoring. Unique self-contained equipment will 
be set up in the area where the submarine sank from which 
readings can be taken regarding the state of the environment 
without the equipment's being removed from the water. This is 
extremely important in order to gain a precise knowledge of the 
situation and precisely forecast how it will develop. 
  The fact that hitherto monitoring has been by no means 
perfect has given rise to a mass of speculation over the problem 
of the Komsomolets. For instance, there has been plenty of 
supposition that the fishing catch may be contaminated as a 
result of a plutonium leak. 
  In theory that possibility is not ruled out. It is known 
that the plankton on which the fish feed spend the winter at a 
depth of 1,000 meters. Sometimes they go down to a depth of 
1,500 meters and very small quantities as far as 2,000 meters. 
We would remind you that the Komsomolets is lying at a depth of 
1,700 meters. Thus, there is a likelihood of the plankton and 
then the fish being subjected to radioactive contamination. But 
how great is it? That also has to be ascertained using the 
state-of-the-art monitoring apparatus, some of which has been 
developed by Russian specialists, some by foreigners. 
  What is more, one of the tasks facing the 1994 expedition is 
to rehearse the technologies for emergency and monitoring work 
in extraordinary situations in the oceans of the world. 
  This program will cost Russian taxpayers 4.625 billion 
rubles 
and [as published] $4.1 million. But evidently this expenditure 
is worth it in order to prevent a possible nuclear catastrophe 
and stop speculation over the problem.

<TEXT>
   The discoverers of the sunken Titanic
announced a venture Wednesday designed to bring undersea exploration
of a Roman shipwreck to thousands of students across the country via
live television.
   Robert Ballard, who led the team that found the Titanic in 1985,
said students, linked by satellite to at least nine science museums
in the United States and Canada, will be able to communicate with
explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the
Mediterranean Sea floor.
   While the $6 million, privately funded project involves several
advances in technology, Ballard said its main purpose is to excite
students about science.
   ``We really have a crisis of education in the United States,''
Ballard said at a news conference at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. In recent years, he said, science has failed to provide
young, impressionable students with attractive role models.
   Instead, he said, the role models are ``that scientists are
nerds, or as my kids would say, dweebs, and dweebs sit at terminals
and are dropouts from society.''
   In the ``Jason Project,'' named after the underwater robot that
helped explore the Titanic, high-quality television cable will be
connected to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface. For
14 days next May, the ship and its 50-member crew, including six
high school students, will control the movements of the robot and
send back satellite images from two underwater locations.
   In addition, the National Georgraphic Society plans to produce
and broadcast a later special on the expedition.
   The live broadcasts will be transmitted via the Turner
Broadcasting System in Atlanta and Electronic Data Systems Corp. in
Atlanta to the nine science museums in Boston, Chicago, Memphis,
Washington, D.C., Dallas, Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y., Charlotte,
N.C., and Victoria, British Columbia. The shipboard crew will
broadcast six programs a day or 84 40-minute programs in all that
will be seen by a total of roughly 200,000 students.
   Instead of simply sitting and watching the programs, the students
will have before them a multiscreen control room that replicates the
control center on the ship. Students will be able to ask questions
of the crew and in some cases take over the controls of Jason,
Ballard said.
   Ballard called the concept ``telepresence.''
   The plan is for Jason to explore an undersea volcano field off
the west coast of Italy where minor eruptions, emissions of molten
minerals and an abundance of wildlife will be visible. At another
western Mediterranean site, which Ballard declined to disclose,
Jason will send back pictures of a vast debris field believed to be
the remains of several Roman shipwrecks from the second century, A.D.
   Frank Ireton of the National Science Teachers Association, which
is helping train science teachers who will bring their classes to
the programs, said, ``It's a tremendous interest-generator. If we
have 200,000 students and we interest 10 percent of them in science,
my gosh, that's a tremendous benefit.''

<HEAD>Kids Nationwide Tune In To $7 Million Science Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

   A popular robot was relegated to the sidelines,
but thousands of excited schoolchildren still watched in awe as a
$7 million science project lit up screens nationwide, whisking
viewers to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The satellite-relayed view from a camera-equipped submersible
robot Monday was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an
expected 250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to
Florida.
   The project suffered a temporary setback last week when Jason,
the 7-foot long robot whose older brother first explored the sunken
Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off
the coast of Italy.
   The cable used to lower the million-dollar submersible and its
mobile garage, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100 feet to the
soft, silty ocean floor.
   The robot was recovered apparently undamaged Saturday, but sat
out the first 40-minute broadcast Monday.
   The biggest laugh of the morning came when Kenneth, a grade
school student from Memphis, Tenn., had a chance to question Dr.
Robert Ballard, the head of the expedition.
   ``Is Jason all right?'' he asked, his voice crackling over a
3,000-mile connection to the support ship, Star Hercules.
   ``Jason is fine,'' Ballard told his student audience via the
two-way hookup. ``His pride's a little hurt, but luckily none of
his instrumentation is.''
   Ballard sought to reassure the students, who have through weeks
of lessons and classroom discussion developed an affection for the
little propeller-driven robot explorer.
   Jason can be remotely driven in and around underwater objects.
Its replacement Monday, Medea, is merely a sophisticated camera
platform that is towed to the ocean floor.
   Broadcasting from his control center on the bridge, Ballard took
questions from students at three of the 13 participating museums,
narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and set the stage for
pre-prepared films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek
voyager Jason, for whom the 20th century robot was named.
   For some of the kids, the show wasn't quite the same without its
star.
   ``The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would
seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said
10-year-old Almas Rathod of the Walter J. Paton School in
Shrewsbury, Mass. ``It wasn't like that.''
   But classmate Barry Lyall said the field trip had lived up to
his expectations.
   ``It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a
classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of Scotland said. ``It was the
next best thing to being there.''
   The project, whose sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., the National
Geographic Society and Electronic Data Systems, was scheduled to
move 120 miles southwest next week, where it will broadcast from
the site of a 2,000-year-old Roman trading ship.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

<LEADPARA>  Like Lord Jim, Joseph Conrad's wandering sailor whose honor is questioned for
abandoning a sinking ship, the captain of the Oceanos is the focus of wide
attention and criticism for his behavior during the rescue of people aboard
the sinking ocean liner.;    Although accounts differ as to when the captain,
Yiannis Avranas, abandoned the Greek liner, several passengers have criticized
him and his crew for jumping into lifeboats or climbing onto helicopters
before everyone on board had been rescued.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GOING DOWN WITH SHIP IS MATTER OF TRADITION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See also related story on page 1A of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the tradition of the sea, captains are expected to "go down with the
ship," or at least stay with their sinking ships until the very last minute.; 
  But in interviews, Avranas was unapologetic for leaving the ship ahead of
others, saying he was better able to direct rescue efforts from shore.;   
'Outrageous attitude';  This statement has placed the 51-year-old Greek
captain in a sea of controversy.;    "That's the most outrageous attitude I've
heard in my life," said Frank Braynard, curator of the Merchant Marine Museum,
in Kings Point, N.Y., and an author of several books on shipping.;    "It's
absolutely beyond comprehension that a man, even under those conditions, would
say something like that.";    Braynard said the captain should lose his
license and face criminal prosecution for "betraying the responsibilities of a
ship's master that date from the earliest days of navigation.";    But as a
South African inquiry begins to explore the causes and legal liabilities of
the sinking, it may well emerge that Avranas' offense was not a legal one but
a transgression against the way people believe a captain should behave.;   
Tradition vs. instruction;  Richard Ashworth, a New York specialist in
maritime law, said the captain probably believed that he was doing the right
thing.;    "The tradition of the sea is that the captain goes down with his
ship, but I don't know that that's the instruction," he said. "It would
surprise me if he left because he felt he was in danger.";    What
disciplinary action, if any, is taken against Avranas will depend on the
countries that have issued licenses to him and his vessel, Ashworth said.;   
Nikos Papaconstantinou, a spokesman for the Greek Embassy, in Washington, said
Monday night that Greece would investigate the accident and probably review
the shipping company's license along with the captain's.;    Papaconstantinou
could not say whether Greece requires captains of ships that fly the Greek
flag to go down with their vessels.;    Inspired by the movies?;  "This is the
common practice or tradition," he said. "I don't know if this is glorified by
the movies, or whether this is the law.";    Even if Avranas is not punished
for his actions, he may find himself ostracized in the tradition-bound world
of international shipping, experts said.;    In 1965, a cruise liner called
the Yarmouth Castle caught fire in the Caribbean and began to sink. A nearby
ocean liner, the Bermuda Star, sent lifeboats to help.;    When the sinking
ship's captain was one of the first people rescued to climb aboard the Bermuda
Star, the Bermuda Star's captain was so incensed that he forced his colleague
to return to the burning wreck until all the passengers were accounted for.
The Yarmouth Castle's captain was eventually rescued.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Titan 4 Rocket Gives Pentagon Ability to Launch Heavy Military Payloads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the successful maiden launch of
the huge Titan 4, the Pentagon has an unmanned rocket that lessens
its reliance on the space shuttle for lifting heavy military
satellites into orbit.
   Nearly 40 of those satellites have languished in storage for lack
of a launch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded more than
three years ago.
   The 20-story-tall Titan 4 made a spectacular debut Wednesday when
it thundered off its launch pad with a 2{-ton satellite designed to
provide instant alert of a missile attack on the United States.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, the $180 million
satellite, a $45 million payload booster stage and other costs
raising the total to close to $500 billion.
   The Air Force reported the big rocket had successfully passed its
maiden test and placed its military satellite in orbit.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because it's
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster which will give
us assured access to space for our critical heavy national security
payloads,'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman.
   The Air Force reported only that the rocket launched Wednesday
carried a classified payload which it would not identify for
national security reasons.
   However, it has been widely reported by knowledgeable observers
and by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine and other
publications that the rocket carried an advanced missile warning
satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   Defense Department officials decided after Challenger exploded in
1986 that they were relying too much on the manned shuttle for
critical military payloads. So they more than doubled the number of
Titan 4s on order and authorized development of two new smaller
rockets, the Delta 2 and Atlas 2, for medium-size payloads.
   The Delta 2 made its debut in February, carrying a navigation
satellite into orbit. It repeated with another navigation payload
Saturday.
   The shuttle flights resumed last September, and the second flight
in December deployed one of the backlogged heavy military
satellites. Two more are scheduled on shuttle flights later this
year, with at least one more Titan 4 launch planned.
   The Pentagon hopes eventually to shift most of the payloads to
the Titan 4, which can boost 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150
to 300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to so-called
stationary orbits 23,000 miles up.
   The U.S. once had a much more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5 that
launched Apollo astronauts to the moon. It could hoist 240,000
pounds into orbit. The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's
largest rocket, has nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   Both the Air Force and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are studying designs fpr a large advanced booster
capable of lifting between 150,000 and 200,000 pounds to orbit.
   The space shuttle can deliver 55,000 pounds.

   A Soviet ocean liner with more than 950
people aboard rammed an iceberg in arctic seas and took on water
today, but all passengers were evacuated. Some crew members stayed
aboard to try to keep the ship afloat.
   A Norwegian coast guard vessel and helicopters rescued passengers
from the 630-foot Maxim Gorky and others who already had fled to
lifeboats and ice floes. Most of the passengers are Western European
vacationers.
   The cruise ship radioed northern Norway's Rescue Coordination
Center at 12:27 a.m. that it was listing after hitting an iceberg
about 300 miles east of northern Greenland, a coast guard spokesman
said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the accident occurred in fog.
   Norwegian and Soviet officials reported no injuries in the
collision. Finn B. Hansen of the Rescue Coordination Center said the
coast guard vessel arrived at 4:15 a.m. and all passengers were
rescued by about 7:30 a.m.
   Passengers said the evacuation was orderly.
   ``There was no panic at all,'' said West Germany passenger
Winfried Prince. ``The Russian crew has worked perfectly in
disembarking passengers into lifeboats, and also the Norwegians who
picked us up ... have done a wonderful job, so nobody has been hurt
or even worse,'' Prince told NBC's ``Today'' show in a
radio-telephone interview from a rescue ship.
   Hansen said the ship was apparently saved from sinking by new
pumps brought by a Soviet tugboat and a Norwegian helicopter after
others broke down. ``It looks like there is enough new pumping
equipment aboard to keep it afloat,'' he said.
   The commander of the coast guard boat Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said
253 crewmen were being kept on board the Maxim Gorky. About 120
crewmen were rescued.
   The Senja reached the stricken ship early today and picked up
hundreds of passengers who had jumped into lifeboats or scrambled
onto ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain, said
Kjell Larssen of the north Norway Rescue Center at Bodoe. Others
were rescued by helicopter from the ship or ice floes.
   Norwegian officials and the Lloyds insurance company of London
said none of the passengers were missing or injured.
   The German travel agency Phoenix Flugreisen of Bonn, which
managed the cruise, said said 551 Germans and 16 other west
Europeans were aboard and that a plane will be sent to pick them up.
   The Norwegian news agency said the passengers were from West
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Britain, Italy, Switzerland and
Sweden.
   Tass quoted Vladimir Nekhoroshev, chief inspector for the
Ministry of the Sea Fleet, as saying 575 tourists and 377 crew
members were on board.
   The rescue center said it had received conflicting figures, but
said there were 379 crew members.
   The liner was 185 miles west of the Norway's Spitsbergen
archipelago.
   Rescue efforts were aided by the 24-hour summer daylight of the
Arctic.
   Several other Soviet and Norwegian boats were within 300 miles of
the cruise liner.
   Norwegian helicopters ferried rescued passengers from the Senja's
deck to Longyearbyen, the adminstrative center on Svalbard island,
the largest in the Spitsbergen archipelago. Airplanes were picking
them up and taking them on to the Norwegian mainland.
   The liner had originated in Bremerhaven, West Germany. It cruised
to Iceland and was to pass the Spitsbergen islands before making its
way south along the Norwegian coast on its way home, the Norwegian
news agency NTB said.
   The Maxim Gorky was built in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union in
1974. In recent summers, it has carried mostly West Germans on tours
from Hamburg arranged by German tour operator NUR.
   The ship was crippled a few hundred miles north of where a Soviet
nuclear submarine caught fire and sank on April 7. More than 40
sailors died in that accident.
   There have been a series of recent accidents on Soviet cruise
ships.
   In February 1986, the liner Mikhail Lermontov sank off of New
Zealand after striking a reef. Of the 739 passengers and crew
aboard, all but one crew member were rescued.
   In August of that year the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov collided
with a freighter in the Black Sea and sank, killing several hundred
Soviet tourists.
   A fire aboard the cruise ship Priamurye while it was docked in
Osaka, Japan, in May 1988 claimed the lives of 11 Soviet tourists.

   A plane searching for two sailors missing from a
freighter that sank in stormy seas spotted a body floating in the
Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, a Coast Guard official said.
   Twenty-three rescued sailors nursed bruises and waited for news
while long-range aircraft and several merchant vessels fanned out
over 480 square miles of ocean about 400 miles southeast of Cape
Cod, where the Star of Alexandria sank Monday.
   The body was spotted by one of three Coast Guard planes, Coast
Guard Petty Officer Mike Milan said in New York.
   Surviving crew members said one of the missing sailors
apparently injured himself when he jumped overboard as the ship
went down.
   ``The feeling is that was him,'' Milan said. ``But we haven't
given up hope of finding the other man.''
   Milan said the second man had a chance to survive because he was
uninjured and wearing a life jacket when he washed off a life raft.
   ``The water temperature is warm enough that he could survive
indefinitely,'' Milan said.
   ``One way or another we hope to wrap this thing up tomorrow,''
he said.
   The surviving crew members, who were transferred to the Coast
Guard cutter Chilula from the British freighter Ravenscraig earlier
in the day, should arrive in Boston late Wednesday, he said.
   ``The crew will be interviewed as to what happened on the ship
and then the company that owned the ship will take care of it from
there,'' Petty Officer Gary Rives said.
   He said it still was unclear what caused the sinking.
   The Ravenscraig picked up the 23 multinational crew members
after rescue planes spotted a lifeboat and a life raft and guided
the 950-foot vessel to the scene, said Petty Officer Joe Gibson. A
second life raft was recovered, but empty, he said.
   The 500-foot Star of Alexandria was bound for New York City from
Athens when crew members reported it began taking on water in
12-foot seas and winds of between 30 mph and 35 mph, Gibson said.
   The Star of Alexandria was registered in England and designed to
carry bulk freight. The ship is owned by Caribene Investments Ltd.
of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping
registry.
