One Poet's Wide World: In Word and Picture

   In 1792, young William Wordsworth, in Paris and all heated up with revolutionary ardor, was ready to offer his words, his self, his very life to the Girondist party. 
His appalled family threatened to cut off his allowance, and so he went home, his saved head soon reverberating with "Tintern Abbey." 
The Girondists in the meanwhile mostly headed up the long steps to the guillotine, dispatched there by Robespierre and the Jacobins. 

   Now this near-martyr who is more often remembered as the fuddy-duddy who lived in cozy comfort at Dove Cottage with his doting sister Dorothy, is the hero of a new show at the New York Public Library: "William Wordsworth and the Age of English Romanticism." 
His long poems and long life (1770-1850) thread together some 300 manuscripts, books, paintings, drawings and prints from 70 libraries, museums and private lenders. 

   It is a superbly interesting show, a model even, in its tasteful design and the intelligent way it links words and images to show all aspects of Romantic thought and sensibility. 
Gallery walls do not glow with a fashionable, lurid pastel color; the catalog can be lifted by an able-bodied person; the wall labels aren't written in the impenetrable artspeak typical of the genre. 
Wordsworth, who thought poetry should be accessible to clodhoppers and to academics, would like this show. 

   The discovery of nature as a theme, the role of memory and the sublime, are probed skillfully in a display that begins with the French Revolution -- "The master theme of the epoch in which we live," as Shelley called it. 
He penned his own Declaration of Rights for the oppressed of England, but, always a bit impractical, disseminated the list in toy boats and homemade hot-air balloons. 
Then he untethered himself from British soil, moving to Italy like so many of the Romantic-era poets -- think of Keats, who expired in a house by Rome's Spanish Steps, or Lord Byron, whom we see in the famous portrait showing him in his resplendent Albanian fighting regalia. 

   Perhaps the rarest autograph in the show is a hastily scrawled page from Shelley's "The Triumph of Life," lent by the Bodleian Library, Oxford. 
It shows how, having framed the question "And what is life, I cried?" 
Shelley changed "And" to "Then" and "cried" to the more moderate "said." 
He never composed the answer. 
We are looking at his last poem. 
Not much later, at age 29, he drowned in his skiff, the Don Juan, off the coast of Viareggio. 

   You can read also from a first edition of "Frankenstein," the horror tale penned earlier by Mary Shelley, the wife left behind on the shore. 
Her maudlin monster also questioned life's meaning. 
"Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth from which all men fled . . ." the blob sobs in chapter 31. (Yes! he discovers soon enough.) 
Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, gazes glumly out of a portrait. 
An early feminist, she died in 1797 depressed by the Revolution's failure to amplify the rights of women. 

   But to hear with what boundless joy revolutionary France was regarded just a few years earlier you can count on Wordsworth. 
"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. 
But to be young was very heaven!" he wrote in his autobiographical poem "The Prelude" without giving any of the juicy details of his doubtless heavenly youthful affair with Annette Vallon. 

   She was the mademoiselle he left behind in France, pregnant with Anne-Caroline. 
She crops up in two letters that have never before been exhibited because they were intercepted by a revolutionary watchdog committee and filed away in a provincial archive. 
In the primmest of scripts, she begs her hotly missed William not to forget "Your Annette who kisses you a thousand times on the mouth." 
Good lord. 
How hard it is to associate such ardor with the bland gent who looks like he has earthworms on his head in the odd portrait bust at the show's entrance. 

   At least Annette survived. 
An exquisite little painting by Jean-Jacques Hauer shows another French lady friend of Wordsworth who did not: Madame Rolland sits in her drawing room with her harp, pet dog and Lafayette. 
Plucky to the last, she managed a much-quoted line before tied down to the plank: "Ah, Liberty! 
How hast thou been sported with!" she said, prompted by a statue of Liberty erected near the guillotine. 
Louis XVI, in contrast, got off no bon mots at all. 
A drum corps had been ordered to drown him out as he reached the top of the scaffold depicted in another painting. 

   Such bloody spectacles did not give a boost to fashionable theories about the perfectibility of man. 
Many sensible poets and painters turned away from politics and took stock of nature, which needed no further perfection in England then. 
Proof is all around you in this show, with its splendid landscapes by John Sell Cotman, Samuel Palmer and most of all, John Constable, who shared Wordsworth's feelings for the simple felicities of the countryside. 

   "For I have learned," wrote Wordsworth, "To look on Nature not as in the hour/Of thoughtless youth, but hearing often times/The still, sad music of humanity." 
The passage is from "Tintern Abbey," and the bare, ruined choirs of the place itself can be seen, gorgeously dilapidated, in an early watercolor by J.M.W. Turner, one of the show's many superb works by this poet of light and color. 

   More often, as he got older, Wordsworth explored a more private landscape -- the topography of his mind, searching "memory's cells" for inspirational scenes that would billow his sails. 
He worried that his powers were failing, and anyone who has ever read "Is this, Ye Gods, the Capitoline Hill?" written in the 1830s and my favorite worst Wordsworth passage, will know why he did. 
But, paradoxically, his fear of dimming down more often produced stunning rhymes. 
Consider these lines from his "Intimations of Immortality": 

   "What though the radiance which was once so bright/Be now for ever taken from my sight,/Though nothing can bring back the hour/of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower. . . ." 

   "Wordsworth and the Age of English Romanticism" was organized by Jonathan Wordsworth, a descendant of the poet, Michael C. Jaye and Robert Woof. 
The Economist magazine and the National Endowment for the Humanities are the main sponsors; the show stays here through Jan. 2, then heads for the Indiana University Art Museum, Bloomington, Ind. (Jan. 27-March 6) and the Chicago Historical Society (April 6-June 5).

<TEXT>     "It may sound expensive, but it will be cheaper than trying to acquire
nearly 5,000 volumes," said Stephen Pocock, the senior project editor at
publishers Chadwyck-Healey Ltd. of Cambridge. The discs will become available
between March 1992 and March 1994.;    "Some of these poets have not been
reprinted since their work was originally published in the 17th and 18th
centuries. The poetry will be indexed by author, title, part-title and key
words so that anyone searching it will be able to see if some poets borrowed

said the work stopped at 1900 because of copyright difficulties with 20th
century poetry.;    Publication is scheduled for three installments, one disc
each for the periods 600 to 1660 and 1661 to 1800 and the last two for the
19th century, which contains as much verse as the other two periods together,
Pocock said.;    "All the published work of these poets will be included, the
famous and the completely obscure, whether it was poetry of genius or just
plain awful. Even famous poets like (William) Wordsworth wrote some dire stuff
at times," he said.;    Even one of Wordsworth's worst lines will be included:
"This piteous news so much it shocked her, She quite forgot to send the
doctor.";    Besides the great masters like William Shakespeare, John Milton
and Lord Byron, the project will include little-known versifiers.;    One is
William Tennant, whose epic 1822 poem "The Thane of Fife" has some memorable
imagery like, "Now, in the very navel of the sky" and "Morning's
golden-tassell'd shoes, Had leapt from sea and now in heaven walk dry.";   
"It's taken 15 people all summer just to count the words involved and there
are more than 1 billion characters," said John Russell, the publisher's sales
director.;    Pocock said the poets are those listed in "The New Cambridge
Bibliography of English Literature," issued by Cambridge University Press from
1969 to 1972, and which includes English translations of Welsh, Scottish and
Irish poets who wrote in other languages.;    "We expect university libraries
around the world, English faculties and some public libraries to buy it. Much
of the material is hard to come by and isn't available in some British
libraries," Pocock said.  </TEXT>

HUNTINGTON ASSEMBLES DRAWINGS OF HISTORIC BRITISH FIGURES

The Huntington Art Gallery's current exhibition, "British Portrait Drawings of 
Notables," takes as its central theme the famous historic individuals in 
European literature, the arts and politics. It offers a modest but often 
delightful look at writers and poets such as Charles Dickens and Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning and such memorable figures as politician William Gladstone and 
adventurer Captain Blood. 
</P>
<P>
Culled by curator Shelley M. Bennett from the Huntington's collection of more 
than 13,000 drawings and watercolors, the exhibit features some of the most 
famous countenances in European history, from Napoleon to Johann Sebastian 
Bach. 
</P>
<P>
Any exhibit of historical portraiture must unfortunately deal with a 
contemporary ignorance of history. Thankfully, this show's descriptive labels 
are more than just title and artist. They are mercifully brief but give a touch 
of history, a hint of social implication and occasionally even a whiff of 
gossip. This kind of concise information adds immeasurably to an appreciation 
of images such as illustrator James Smetham's gaunt and intense pencil 
self-portrait and comic artist Thomas Rowlandson's stinging watercolor of the 
theatrics of actress Sarah Siddons. 
</P>
<P>
The show isn't large, but the history it covers gets further clarification by 
being broken into three small rooms, which feature heads of state, the arts and 
finally notables in politics, the military and the church. Interestingly 
enough, the distinction of social position also shows some of the artistic 
conventions that artists used to express the personality of their subject. 
Poets and artists like Lord Byron appear to glow with an inner fire. 
</P>
<P>
Creativity frequently lights their the faces with near-mystic inspiration as 
they gaze off into infinity with romantic melancholy. But heads of state such 
as King George IV are ripe for lampooning and wily politicians such as William 
Gladstone are engagingly exaggerated into a kind of physical comedy of 
political blunders. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations and commentary aside, the seduction in these portraits lies in the 
fact that these were memorable individuals. After being duly impressed by their 
credentials and the artistic trappings of their positions, we want to feel we 
can know what they were like as people. We try to read their faces, looking 
deeply into their eyes for humor or cruelty. We see in the scholar Johann 
Bodmer's hawklike profile a keen intellect and summon up William Wordsworth's 
mellowness from his relaxed and open gaze. Portraits provide a way to search 
for character and personality. It's a rewarding and timeless venture that makes 
history seem more about people than events. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all the glamour of famous personalities, this exhibit is remarkably 
restrained, tucked away in an upstairs corner of the Huntington mansion like a 
bright, shy child. The images are small and sometimes so pale the viewer must 
look closely to catch the nuances in color and line. But the subtle charms of 
the doe-eyed illustrator Kate Greenaway and the impishness of artist John 
Linnell are worth looking for. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be on view until June 25 in the Changing Exhibitions Rooms. 
The Huntington is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 1 to 4:30 p.m. and on 
Sundays by reservation.

<TEXT>
   It is one of romantic literature's most flamboyant images. 
The young poet, so beautiful and so talented, driven to swallow arsenic by a callous world, lies dead across his garret bed, his luxurious red hair hanging above a pile of torn manuscript scraps. 
Beauty, death and art! 
Hollywood would call it a socko finish. 

   As Helen's face launched a thousand ships, so Thomas Chatterton's death at 17 launched a thousand elegies. 
Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats and Byron sang his praises. 
French romantics joined in. 
Who else, after all, had so starved, suffered and died for art? 
And so young. 
Wordsworth called him the "marvellous boy" and the phrase stuck in literary memory like a Homeric tag line. 

   Of course, Chatterton was not only a poet, but also a literary counterfeiter who passed off a series of medieval-style poems as the just-discovered work of a 15th-century monk. 
In Peter Ackroyd's brilliant, witty novel, the Chatterton forgeries and tragic death are at the core of a story that cuts back and forth across two centuries. 

   Suppose Chatterton's most audacious deception was not his fake poems, but his 1770 suicide? 
What if instead of dying on his garret bed, Chatterton was a precursor of our century's tribe of disappearing men who, for more mundane reasons such as embezzlement, seemingly drop dead in one life only to surface sipping champagne in Brazil? 

   Suppose Chatterton lived on, not in Brazil, but in an ever-widening world of forgery until he had created hundreds of poems under the names of recently deceased contemporaries? 
Names like Gray, Akenside, Churchill and Blake? 
It would put scholars to work for decades reevaluating 18th-century literature. 
For the discoverer of the great hoax it would bring a measure of literary-world fame. 

   From such questions, Mr. Ackroyd spins a fascinating web of questions, comic and otherwise, about literature and life. 
What is real and what is made up? 
What is original and what is imitation? 
What is valuable? 
What endures? 

   "Chatterton" (Grove, 240 pages, $17.95), which was a No. 1 best seller in Britain last year, is so packed with lively characters, so gracefully written and so adept at mixing wit with learning that no potential reader should be intimidated by its literary source. 
In a page, Mr. Ackroyd supplies all the background needed about Chatterton's short, desperate life and about Henry Wallis's painting of the dead poet, using novelist and poet George Meredith as his model. 
The painting, in London's Tate Gallery, was made some 100 years after Chatterton's death, but it has set the image of Chatterton's deathbed in the minds of generations. 

   Then, Mr. Ackroyd sails into his lively tri-level invention, part exploration of Chatterton's 18th-century life, part 19th-century byplay among egotistical Meredith, romantic Wallis and adulterous Mrs. Meredith, and part contemporary comedy of failed poet Charles Wychwood, well-known novelist Harriet Scrope and their supporting cast caught up in efforts to track down what happened to Chatterton. 

   Mr. Ackroyd is an arch observer of his squalid contemporary scene, a world in which Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" is background music equally at cremations and porn movies. 
Our century is no romantic age. 
Poets don't die pale and beautiful garret deaths. 
They collapse amid the chicken tikka, tandoori mutton and vegetable biryanis in a cheap Pakistani restaurant. 
And, when they rise to the defense of poetry, it is to carping wits eager to mock their eloquence with joking asides. 

   For Harriet, the novelist, old age and a degree of fame have brought her only a jaundiced view of the world. 
Gin-soaked, waspish quips (she mocks friend, foe and stranger alike) dominate her conversation; a desire to buttress her renown at any cost to others dominates her life. 
Characters are as stained as her sofa, but the sofa has an excuse. 
"You'd be stained, too, if you'd been sitting upright for two centuries," Harriet explains. 
Kindness is in short supply. 
"I've given my life to English literature," Harriet remarks. 
Her closest friend quickly jabs: "It's a pity, then, that you didn't get anything in return." 

   It is a world in which everyone plagiarizes, but some prosper while others stumble. 
Some live in fear of being discovered. 
Others blackmail their way to safety. 
Mr. Ackroyd keeps shifting the angle of vision, however, so that all is not despair. 
So what if life is full of imitation? 
If illusion triumphs over reality, what is wrong with that? 
Imagination can conquer grim surroundings. 
Memories can endure. 
Just as Chatterton's fame has long survived his squalid death. 

   Over everyone hovers the spirit of the poet who wrote in his diary: "The truest plagiarism is the truest poetry." 
Or did he? 
Is that his sentence, or another hoax? 
"Without words, there is nothing," Chatterton muses. 
True or false? 

   "Chatterton" is amusing and provocative. 
Only one warning label should be attached lest this novel prompt readers to seek out Chatterton's poems. 
He may have been a "marvellous boy," but the poetry is far from marvelous. 
Let Mr. Ackroyd speak for Chatterton. 
Remember Chatterton the way Mr. Ackroyd, whose inventiveness seems inexhaustible, reinvents him. 

   He saves a wonderful twist for last, one that suggests that in a world where events seem random, romantic legends may spring from anywhere, even from clumsy mistakes.

   The Quintessential English Romantic

   To his lifelong friend Charles Lamb, he was "an archangel
slightly damaged." To his early disciple turned vociferous
critic William Hazlitt, he was a man "sunk into torpid,
uneasy repose, tantalized by useless resources, haunted by
vain imaginings, his lips idly moving." To almost everyone
who encountered him, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was
a dazzling force of nature. Part poet, part orator, part
metaphysical seer, he was a wordsmith who invariably beguiled
his auditors with an unstoppable stream of brilliant,
intoxicating talk.
   The cataract of talk even reached into posterity. "He
seems not a man," wrote Virginia Woolf, "but a swarm, a
cloud, a buzz of words, darting this way and that,
clustering, quivering, and hanging suspended." Yet Coleridge
was much more than a fountain of words. As his biographer,
Richard Holmes, shows in his superlative account of
Coleridge's early life, "Coleridge: Early Vision" (Viking,
409 pages, $22.95), he was in many ways the quintessential
English Romantic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than the grim and prosey Wordsworth, perhaps even
more than the flamboyant Byron or the ethereal Shelley,
Coleridge incarnated the spiritual aspirations of his age.
That he also incarnated its excesses and liabilities is only
too familiar. Coleridge the stalled writer, the irresponsible
dreamer, the shameless plagiarizer; Coleridge the opium
addict and burnt-out case: All that is as much a part of our
literary folklore as Coleridge the author of "Kubla Khan" and
"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
   In this first of two projected volumes, Mr. Holmes takes
us from Coleridge's birth at Devon to the eve of his
departure for Malta in 1804. He chronicles, in other words,
the career of the visionary Coleridge: the radical utopian
schemer and poetic innovator who dreamed of a commune by the
Susquehanna River in America and who collaborated with
Wordsworth on "Lyrical Ballads."
   He also writes of Coleridge the unhappy and perpetually
absent husband, the unrequited lover, the increasingly
despondent and drug-sodden waster. Still to come are
Coleridge the great literary critic, the religious thinker,
the public philosopher.
   The youngest of 10 children, Coleridge found his bucolic
home life shattered when his father -- a learned minister and
schoolmaster -- died in 1781. The young boy was promptly
packed off to school at Christ's Hospital in London, a
brutalizing place that nonetheless provided him with a good
grounding in classics and, eventually, a scholarship to Jesus
College, Cambridge.
   Coleridge was ferociously precocious, able to read a
chapter of the Bible when only three and blessed with an
extraordinary memory. But he proved to be a dilatory student
at best. Already at Cambridge his vacillating and irresolute
character was on full display. Mr. Holmes duly reports the
"wild expenditure on books, drinking, violin lessons, theater
and whoring . . . alternating with fits of suicidal gloom and
remorse." "Coleridge was," he notes, "a man who could confess
spiritual despair at midday; and dine out brilliantly at
midnight."
   But in truth it was restlessness, not sloth, that was
Coleridge's besetting vice. Would that more of us were as
productive as he] Always a prodigious walker, he once covered
263 miles in eight days. He was capable of writing 76
newspaper articles in five months or composing 50 blank verse
lines of a translation of Schiller's "Wallenstein" in a
single day.
   Yet he could not stay put. A planned three-month trip in
Germany with the Wordsworths stretched on for 10 months. As
usual, his wife, Sara, remained impatiently behind with the
children, one of whom died while his father was away.
Coleridge was as addicted to drawing up lists of impossible
works and projects as he was to opium. "He dreamed more than
he planned," writes Mr. Holmes, "he planned more than he
could execute {and he was} never still or concentrated for
more than a few weeks at a time."
   Mr. Holmes does not attempt to excuse Coleridge's
failings. But his enthusiasm for this damaged archangel
remains undiminished. Rather, like Coleridge himself, he
understands -- and lets us understand -- that "the hope of
recreating himself imaginatively out of the sense of failure
itself" early on became one of Coleridge's chief spurs to
creativity and reflection.
   In this, Coleridge could not have been more different from
Wordsworth. While Wordsworth was composing his great
Immortality Ode, with its vision of the past as a "perpetual
benediction," Coleridge wrote "Dejection: An Ode," meditating
on "A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,/ Which finds no
natural outlet, no relief."
   This account of the young Coleridge is a fit sequel to Mr.
Holmes's magisterial biography of Shelley (1974). Perhaps its
greatest achievement is to have reminded us of how complex
Coleridge was, how he managed to salvage an enlivening
passion even from disappointment and dissipation. "If he does
not leap out of these pages -- brilliant, animated, endlessly
provoking -- and invade your imagination," Mr. Holmes writes
in his preface, "then I have failed to do him justice." Few
readers, perhaps, will close this book unexasperated by
Coleridge's foibles; I think none will come to the end
unmoved by his painfully expansive genius.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: Poet hobbled by passion - The work of Stephen
Spender, 85 this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOLPHINS by Stephen Spender Faber and Faber Pounds 12.99 (Pounds 5.99
paperback) 46 pages
This month, the great cultural monument that is Sir Stephen Spender will be
85 years of age. It is now more than 30 years since the death of Louis
MacNeice, 20 since the deaths of WH Auden and C. Day Lewis and 10 since that
of Christopher Isherwood. Spender, the last surviving member of that
much-memorialised generation of the 1930s, has survived them all - and he
continues to write and review regularly to this day.
The poetry, however, has come very slowly. His last full collection, The
Generous Days, was published in 1971; his Collected Poems of 1985, though
containing some new works (including notable elegies to MacNeice and Auden)
was largely a re-presentation - often drastically re-worked  - of older
material.
In 'Worldsworth', the best poem of his new collection, Dolphins, he records
his first brush with poetry. In 1916 the Spenders were obliged to leave
their home on the cliffs near Sheringham, Norfolk after two stray German
bombs fell nearby. The family decamped to a farmhouse near Lake Derwentwater
and it was there that Spender, then seven years old, heard his father
reading Wordsworth in the garden. The vocabulary and the cadences of
romanticism became a life-long passion and it is a passion that has both
enriched and hobbled his poetry.
'Worldsworth' is just one of several autobiographical poems in this short
collection. Another, 'Air Raid', captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb, that
'unreasoning fury from an enemy's vision of life', destroys the outer walls
of a house, turning what had once been private and inside - a bath, a
wardrobe, books, the telephone - into a public spectacle. All that "tender
sensitive life" has been thrown away.
Variants upon this observation are the over-riding theme of the collection,
no matter how widely it may seem to range in subject matter  - from memories
of the first and second world wars, through elegies for dead friends, to a
long poem which examines the explosive relationship between Rimbaud and
Verlaine. What can be preserved of the intensities of the inner life in a
world that seems hell bent on its own annihilation? The poet, according to
Spender, acts as a mediator between the uniquely private self and the world
outside us. There is a lived, shared reality which is both general to
everyone and unique to each person, and it is poetry's task to describe it.
Unfortunately Spender's abilities in this book are rarely equal to his
vision. 'Air Raid' collapses at the end into cliche and verbal redundancy;
many of the other poems seem too casually written, as if they are little
more than notebook jottings. Only in the Wordsworthian blank verse of
'Worldsworth' do we find a sustained and excellent piece of writing from
beginning to end.
Sir Stephen Spender, cultural ambassador plenipotentiary, the memorialiser
of himself and his famous generation, journalist, editor, essayist,
university teacher and literary critic seems to have spent so much time
clinking glasses across tables and lurching from glittering lunch to equally
glittering dinner (anyone who doubts this should read his Journals
1939-1983) that it is a wonder he has had the time - or the powers of
concentration - to write any good poetry at all. The fact is, of course,
that he has written a little. But most critics would agree that he has not
achieved his life-long ambition to be a great poet. His more enduring
achievements have been elsewhere: as a writer of prose, for example, (an
autobiography, World within World, is his masterpiece). Here he has found a
way with words that is much more subtle, flexible and assured than most of
his poetry ever manages to be, marred as it so often is by a peculiar
stiffness and Shelleyan rhetoric. As a spokesman for liberal values, no
matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be,
Spender has also made his mark: to argue for the sacredness of the
individual and his impulses is, after all, one of the finest fruits of the
romantic movement.

<HEAD>Actor's Ashes to be Entombed in Westminster Abbey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ashes of Laurence Olivier will be buried in
Westminster Abbey among monarchs, prime ministers and great artists
of past centuries.
   The Very Rev. Michael Mayne, dean of the church where England's
kings and queens are crowned, said a public memorial service for the
actor would also be held in the abbey this autumn.
   No date for either event was announced, but Mayne said the burial
and placement of a memorial plaque would be some time after the
memorial service.
   Olivier, 82, died July 11.
   Two of the great actors with whom he was frequently compared,
David Garrick and Henry Irving, are buried in the abbey.
   Among other famous tombs in the former monastic church are
Geoffrey Chaucer, author of the ``Canterbury Tales''; the
lexicographer Samuel Johnson; the playwrights Ben Jonson and Richard
Brinsley Sheridan; and poets Robert Browning and Alfred, Lord
Tennyson.
   William Shakespeare is among the artists honored by a monument in
``Poet's Corner,'' but is not buried in the church. Others so
honored include John Milton, William Wordsworth, Charles Dickens,
Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen, T.S. Eliot, and Emily, Anne and Charlotte
Bronte.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Travel: Romantic inspiration in Somerset - Christian Tyler
heads west and discovers what influenced Wordsworth and Coleridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRY, YOU tireless travellers, to define what is meant by 'a sense of place.'
Is it a view, a sound, a smell, a state of mind? Poets describe it,
musicians too - and, of course, painters who work out of doors.
In a walled garden in the west of England, with a wooded slope of the
Quantock hills behind him and the Bristol Channel invisible below, the
painter David Imms is as attached to bits of the English terrain as any
Aborigine to his song-line.
He was born in the near north and lives in the east Midlands. But it is to
the south-west that he goes to paint: bodies in the landscape, bodies as
part of the landscape, bodies fertilising the earth. After a week on the
millstone grit of Yorkshire he is grinding his teeth. 'I think I am happier
on chalk soil', he said in the matter-of-fact way of one stating a
preference for, say, Bournemouth over Bridlington.
And he is right about travelling west. There is some primitive urge which is
satisfied by following the path of the sun. As you race down the motorway
the grease and smoke of London are sloughed off, the sky expands, the light
and the air turn softer, the colours richer. The sea is perceptible long
before it becomes visible, and at sunset the clouds pile dramatically above
it to compose the mythical land across the water: Tir-na-Og.
In this walled garden in the west, part of the Alfoxton Park estate at
Holford in north Somerset, the sense of place is overpowering. It is a warm
enclosure of reddish earth and brick, quartered by box hedges and planted to
bursting with vegetables, flowers and fruit. It is alive with flying and
crawling creatures not seen since the pre-chemical age. 'Organic' is the
word they use, but the word is too sterile.
The Mad Hatter of Alice in Wonderland protested that to see what you eat is
not to eat what you see. In this instance the Hatter's logic is faulty: you
may see (or paint) your cabbage in the morning and eat it that night. Around
the garden live other attendants of the dinner table: the Large Black pigs
(Pavarotti and Domingo) behind the barn, chickens in the run, goats beside
the driveway and sheep grazing among the deer in the bracken above.
The landscape of Alfoxton Park inspired the early Romantic poets. Wordsworth
lived there in 1797-1798 with his sister Dorothy. At the same time Coleridge
occupied a cottage in Nether Stowey, three miles away, with his wife and
children. Their ghosts have in turn become imprinted on the place.
According to Dorothy, it was on one of their night walks that the Rime of
the Ancient Mariner was conceived and it was in one of the panelled rooms at
Alfoxton that Coleridge five months later recited the finished work to his
friends. Here, too, the poets collaborated to produce Lyrical Ballads.
Dorothy was an indefatigable diarist of Nature's effects in this corner of
England. Her words, as well as suggesting images to the two poets, convey
their own innocently uncontrived sense of place:
'April 2: A very high wind', she wrote. 'Coleridge came to avoid the smoke
(she means, presumably, of poor Sara's cramped kitchen); stayed all night.
We walked in the wood, and sat under the trees. The half of the wood
perfectly still while the wind was making a loud noise behind us. The still
trees only gently bowed their heads, as if listening to the wind. The
hollies in the thick wood unshaken by the blast; only, when it came with a
greater force, shaken by the rain drops falling from the bare oaks above.'
Rebuilt in 1710 on much older foundations, the house is now a hotel of
creaking floorboards, modest comfort and somewhat shambly decor; but it is
privately run, has an unfussily family feel to it - and wonderful English
cooking.
A sense of place can be learned by walking. But, as Dorothy says, it has
also to be learned by sitting and looking. This seaward slope of the
Quantocks handsomely repays a week-end's reflection.

ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my 
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep in 
memory for easy retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch 
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being 
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip 
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't a 
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes 
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect 
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do 
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most awe-inspiring 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops 
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about 
every green that nature's got. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never 
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . . a 
feeling that goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the Lake 
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He 
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling," 
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, where lakes are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what 
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I 
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned forward 
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or 
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind of 
enchantment here." 
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through the 
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage, where 
William Wordsworth lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of 
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's rooms are 
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would 
make the rooms warmer in the winter.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When you see 
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as 
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its 
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the area 
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature 
that England has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and 'Daffodils' 
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't spend some 
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was 
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail." 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived here in 
the Lake Country, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just down the 
way. I'll jot down some directions for you." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen 
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country itself 
was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have missed it 
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife recognized 
from the stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly 
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us 
through the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring a 
bell?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested 
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in 
the garden was suddenly aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house. 
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper 
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her 
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few 
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing 
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't much of a 
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and 
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing the new 
coat his mother had made him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had 
been told never to visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition 
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a 
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The Tale 
of Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated 
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of languages, to 
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their 
children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered, "but 
she was childless." 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or 
whether fame had only come after her death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land 
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some 
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more 
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls 
'progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this 
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are 
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the 
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it 
may be protected forever." 
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we 
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The 
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and 
turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The 
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I 
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I 
told her I didn't know because I had not seen." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly, 
spoke again. Her father translated. 
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse 
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges 
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and 
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would 
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his 
grandchildren, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and 
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all." 
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any 
children, too." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions 
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to play in?"

JACK SMITH: CONTRACTORS NEVER WORK SO QUICKLY FOR US

<TEXT>
<P>
The 25th Pasadena Showcase of Design is supposed to open to the public Sunday, 
but if it does it will be a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The house this year is a large Mediterranean villa overlooking the Flintridge 
La Canada foothills. When I visited the site a week ago so many tradesmen were 
there I had to park a block and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
Landscapers swarmed over the five-acre estate, finishing pools and gardens. The 
new concrete court in front of the entrance was still wet. A plywood staircase 
was being built to handle the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, not a room was finished. Tile men were still at work in the kitchen. 
There were no seats on the dining room chairs. The grand music room with its 
20-foot vaulted ceiling was bare of furniture. Artists were still painting 
flowers on bedroom walls. A toilet sat in an upstairs hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The 9,000-square-foot house was designed by architect Henry Carlton Newton and 
built in 1924 for Harry G. Johansing Sr. and his wife, the former Mary Emily 
Farfsing, at a cost of $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Johansing was an insurance agent and sportsman. He and his wife had come here 
from Cincinnati. They had four girls and three boys, who evidently had an 
idyllic childhood. The boys lived in one upstairs wing and the girls in the 
other, with their parents' master bedroom in between. The children used 
pull-down beds. 
</P>
<P>
The yard was their jungle. The boys had one enormous tree house and the girls 
another, with a drawbridge to keep the boys out. In the spring, when there was 
water in the creek, the boys followed it down to Devile's Gate Dam and launched 
home-made rafts, much to the dismay of their mother. 
</P>
<P>
For the Showcase, a new formal Roman-style swimming pool had been built. The 
tennis court had been put in by the Johansings. They didn't have a pool, I was 
told, because their father had given the children a choice -- pool or tennis 
court, and they had chosen the court because they could use it for other 
activities. But as teen-agers and young adults they danced on a pavilion 
lighted by Chinese lanterns.

A grand piano was yet to be placed in an alcove off the music room. It had once 
held a pipe organ that Johansing played for nightly musicals. His wife sang. 
The music room had also held a grand piano, a harp and a xylophone. Sometimes 
members of the Civic Light Opera came to sing, and a church choir used the room 
for practice while their church was being built. That's how the rich 
entertained themselves before television. 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the nursery, in which the children were kept, successively, as 
infants, were being decorated with hand-painted bluebells, delphiniums and 
Queen Anne's lace; fairies at the top of the bedposts held a lacy canopy over 
the crib.

<P>
I had received a letter from a landscaper, Leo Snider, saying he had installed 
an English trysting garden, and finding no suitable poem with "tryst" in it, he 
had written one himself and attributed it to William Wordsworth: 
</P>
<P>
 Speak soft but quick where we will tryst 
</P>
<P>
 Where arms were held and lips were kissed 
</P>
<P>
 By waters old, 'ere much he missed! 
</P>
<P>
 "My question," he said, "is whether it is illegal to so attribute a saying to 
another, and if so, is it so if the person is dead or only so if it is really 
awful poetry?" 
</P>
<P>
I found Snider at work in his garden. Beds of marigolds and white and purple 
petunias surrounded a small pool under a live oak. A nice place to tryst. I 
told him I didn't think Wordsworth would sue, though he might turn over in his 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
The Showcase will be open to the public Sunday through May 21; 10 a.m to 4 p.m. 
Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. 
(Mornings are full.) Free parking and shuttle service from the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry about its not being finished. The Pasadena Junior Philharmonic 
Committee and their hordes of landscapers and interior decorators somehow 
always manage to bring off this miracle. 
</P>
<P>
As for a poem with tryst in it, how about this: 
</P>
<P>
 By the petunias we will tryst 
</P>
<P>
 Under the live oak in the mist 
</P>
<P>
 I'm attributing it to William Shakespeare.

   The red building tucked away in the scenic
mountains of northwest Virginia looks more like a schoolhouse than
the nation's first prefabricated jail made from converted shipping
containers.
   New picnic tables in the back overlook a lush green field.
There's plenty of room outside the building for exercise or
picnics. But the building is being noticed for more than its looks.
   ``I think what these people are doing for prison construction is
equivalent to what Henry Ford did for automobile construction,''
said Richard Abell, assistant U.S. attorney general for justice
programs. ``Henry Ford did not invent the automobile, but he made
it accessible. What these people are doing is making prisons
accessible.''
   Abell said the Loudoun County facility is the first of its kind
in the country. He said what makes this jail different is ``no one
has ever taken these shipping containers already made, and made
them into jails.''
   Surfside 6 Industries of McLean built the six-cell, 23-cot jail
in 13 working days for $96,398. That translates into a cost of
about $4,000 a bed.
   ``Ordinarily, it costs $40,000 to $100,000 per bed space, and it
generally takes two years to build a jail or a prison,'' Abell
said. ``These guys put it together in two weeks. That's beyond
revolutionary.''
   Abell said another advantage is the flexibility of the prefab
jails.
   ``Like Tinkertoys, they can be rearranged if they need to be
changed in five or 10 years,'' Abell said. ``If the needs have
decreased, they're not stuck with it on the landscape. You don't
have a problem like San Francisco has with Alcatraz _ a big massive
sore on the landscape.''
   Jim Wordsworth, secretary and treasurer of Surfside 6, said the
prefab building could be used as a shelter for the homeless or to
store records.
   Each steel shipping container is 8 feet tall, 8 feet wide and 20
feet long, Wordsworth said. To convert it into a jail cell, the
container is insulated and a wall covering such as cement or
drywall is put on. The finished building uses traditional plumbing,
wiring and heating.
   Wordsworth said the used containers are transported to Surfside
6 Industries' factory in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and put together
there, then shipped to the location. He said they can be built on
site too.
   Abell, a member of the National Institute of Corrections
Advisory Board, said prison crowding has become a national problem.
   ``Between 1963 and 1981, our crime rate soared 337 percent in
the United States and prison construction in the same period went
up 27 percent,'' Abell said.
   Loudoun County Sheriff John Isom said there is a shortage of
about 3,000 beds in the Washington, D.C., area, and of about 1,900
beds in northern Virginia.
   He said the maximum-security prison in Leesburg has 63 beds and
averages 100 people a day. He said he plans to move at least 23
people who are in work-release programs to the prefab jail when it
opens this month.
   But Isom said, ``Overcrowding will continue unless someone
figures out a way to eradicate the drug problem.''
   Crowding causes many problems, he said, including violence.
   ``We have inmate fights a couple of times a week,'' Isom said.
   While counties elsewhere have agonized over finding sites and
money to build large, future-oriented buildings equipped with
computer-controlled security and even robot food carts, Isom said
he was looking for a quick and inexpensive solution.
   He and Wordsworth said the jail's security will be adequate.
Wordsworth said a special welding torch would be required to cut
through the walls, made of Insulcrete, a patented concrete with
high insulation quality.
   He said officials from all over the country are calling about
the jail.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``They're bringing the county
administrator, the director of finance, the sheriff to look at this.
   ``It's unique, it's portable, you can set it down and then move
the whole structure,'' he said. ``There is so much citizen unrest
on the location of prisons and jails ... They can assure the
citizens they're temporarily solving a problem until they go
through all of the rituals of building.''
   Greg Bogdan, spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said
the bureau isn't opposed to the prefab idea, but says it isn't the
long-term solution to the crowding problem.
   ``They're suitable for emergency situations, but they're not an
answer to the long-term prison problem as far as the bureau is
concerned,'' Bogdan said. ``There is still a need for permanent
facilities.''

COTTAGE TALES by John Clare Carcanet Pounds 9.95, 158 pages
JOHN CLARE: THE POET AND THE PLACE by Peter Moyse Crossberry Press, Helpston
Pounds 11.95, 120 pages
UNLIKE many other poets of the English countryside John Clare, who was born
200 years ago this week, had a thorough-going knowledge of every aspect of
rural life and he wrote about it without sentimentality. Given his
background, this is not surprising. Born in the small village of Helpston,
then in Northamptonshire now in in Cambridgeshire, to parents that Clare
himself described as 'illiterate to the last degree', he worked at a whole
range of physical tasks as the occasion and the needs of the family
demanded: as corn thresher, ploughboy, gardener (at Burghley House,
Stamford), lime-burner and pot boy at the local inn. And even when at the
height of his brief period of fame in the 1820s, he continued to plough the
land.
His 'conversion' to poetry took place at 13. He was lent a copy of Thomson's
Seasons, a sequence of vague pastoral encomiums that was much in vogue at
the beginning of the 19th century. The book made Clare's heart 'twitter with
joy'. By the time he had reached his 20s, his own verse had been brought to
the attention of John Keats' publisher, John Taylor, who released his first
collection of poetry in 1820: Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenes by
John Clare, a Northamptonshire Peasant - title fit to make a proud
provincial blench.
It was reprinted several times and Clare, on the wings of unanticipated
success, made several visits to distant London, where he had his portrait
painted by William Hilton (RA) and was generally lionised, at the age of 26,
as the capital's newest literary celebrity. Unfortunately, the succeeding
volumes sold less and less well. Clare, it seems, was unable to meet the
general public's - and his own publisher's - incessant demands for novelty.
In fact, by the middle of the 1820s his publisher, once a helpmate, had
become a torment. Why was this so?
Clare was a poet who worked by his own lights, spelling and punctuating
exactly as he saw fit, and writing the kind of poetry that, in the opinion
of his publisher, would be less and less likely to find appeal in the
market-place. Unlike some of the other great Romantics - Shelley, Wordsworth
and Coleridge, for example - Clare was not a man accustomed to seeing
sermons in stones. What he saw were the stones themselves, all that hard,
flinty glitter, and he did his utmost to describe them with a particularity
unequalled by any previous poet.
The countryside that surrounds Helpston, a terrain of harsh, spare beauty
even to this day, is flat, with a great expanse of sky. It was Clare's
ambition to preserve an honest record of it, and its customs, in the teeth
of the double despoliations of the Enclosure Acts and the advent of the
railways.
John Taylor attacked Clare repeatedly for using 'the language of common
everyday description' and for eschewing the pressing need to introduce an
element of human interest into his nature poetry. These were, after all, the
years in which the novel was coming into vogue. Poetry must be seen to
compete. Clare remained his vulgar self, obstinately inclined to write of
low rustic manners, doggedly refusing to soar into loftier regions.
Taylor cut his manuscripts ruthlessly, changed words, objected to the vivid
local usages that Clare felt most appropriate, and introduced an abundance
of punctuation so that the eyes of the middle-class country tasters from the
metropolis would glide smoothly from line to line and not be brought up
short by bewildering grammatical or orthographical idiosyncrasies. Nowadays
 -and it has taken this long for publishers to recognise that Clare was not
being deliberately wrong-headed and perverse when he chose, like Yeats, to
follow his own instincts - publishers print his poems just as he wrote them,
warts and all, and the lack of punctuation, we now see, helps to give them a
welling, teeming, gulping quality that adds to the richness of the poet's
own observations.
His later years were a protracted agony, the last quarter of a century being
spent in the Northampton asylum, where he continued to write, though now it
was poetry of a much more rootless kind. He had needed Helpston. Without the
familiarity of his home village, its sights, sounds and smells, he felt
wrenched up by the roots and tossed aside.
Two new books have been published to coincide with the bicentenary of
Clare's birth. Cottage Tales is a collection of narrative poems that Clare
intended to include in The Shepherd's Calendar, his third book of poems;
John Clare: the Poet and the Place juxtaposes poems by Clare with
photographs of some of the places in and around Helpston with which he would
have been familiar.
The excellent John Clare Society can provide a list of bicentenary events
(sae please) upon request to: Peter Moyse, The Stables, 1a West St,
Helpston, Peterborough PE6 7DU.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For decades she labored in obscurity, writing
the poems that no one would publish. Now at an age when most people
are considering retiring, Amy Clampitt has begun to attract
attention in the literary world.

   In the early 1980s a New York bookstore
sympathetic to struggling writers returned four of the five copies
of Amy Clampitt's self-published poems she had asked the store to
try to sell. The only one that was sold was bought by a friend of
hers.
   But by the beginning of this year she had four collections
published by a large publishing house, and her work was being
likened in significance to Lowell, Stevens and Plath. One specialty
publisher is now even producing a handmade volume of some of her
work that will cost $700 per book.
   At age 70, Amy Clampitt is enjoying success rarely visited upon
American poets.
   She first attracted attention with the 1983 publication of ``The
Kingfisher,'' which unleashed, to use a phrase from one of her
poems, ``a shower of bloom.'' The praise has largely continued
through three more volumes, most recently, ``Westward.''
   ``All I can tell you is that it wasn't any cinch,'' Clampitt
says.
   For decades she wrote in the deep obscurity of a New York
artist's life, even as the popular appeal of poetry seemed on a
death spiral, especially the sometimes demanding verse _ critics
call it allusive _ that she writes.
   Clampitt must have hardly seemed up to such hardscrabble work
when she left the farm in New Providence, Iowa, a town of 200
people in the heart of the heartland. She was a nervous, elfin kid
who had a Phi Beta Kappa key from Grinnell College, but had not
been enough of a hand around the farm even to have milked a single
cow.
   ``I wasn't very muscular or inclined to do strenuous things,''
she concedes.
   But she learned how to fetch a phrase. She learned mostly from
her grandfather, a lover of reading and nature who once awakened
one of his children and carried her into the night to point out the
sound of a whippoorwill.
   Clampitt's poetry is alive with such pastoral sights and sounds:
the ``cheekily anarchic dartings and flashings'' of birds, the
``vaporous fripperies'' of clouds, of ``bog laurel and lambkill''
the ``blurred flute note'' of a warbler. They all come out in
``torques, in curdlings, cadenzas by the earful.''
   Even when the reader is wading through ``seaweed-clodded
polyphloisboio thalasses'' or trying to see ``chiasmus through the
looking-glass,'' her wordplay is resonant, musical.
   Over the years, as her splendid words went unnoticed, she
sustained herself with a few attempts at traditional work,
including a brief stint as an assistant librarian at the Audubon
Society in New York. But she worked mainly as a free-lance editor.
   By the 1970s, she was reconciling herself to never being widely
read. But she kept writing.
   Then, in 1978, The New Yorker _ one of the magazines which had
``been rejecting me for years'' _ took a long look and decided to
publish some of her work. She had found a kindred spirit in poetry
editor Howard Moss.
   ``He knew what a sundew is,'' she says, recalling with a fresh
giggle one of their early conversations about her writing.
   After The New Yorker, many of the other important magazines
followed. When ``The Kingfisher'' came out, the little world of
American poetry was stunned by the thrill of, the achievement of,
the thing.
   Clampitt, meanwhile, suffered the letdown that comes after
publication of a first major work. She also suffered from all the
attention.
   ``This kind of fame is limited to a little circle, but it is
very different,'' says Clampitt, who was in Cambridge for a reading
of her poems. ``I thought I was going to be a person who spent her
life in obscurity, and then this came. It jolted me. I wasn't ready
to have people know about me.''
   Then, when the windfall of attention had subsided somewhat, the
gainsayers who had been crouching in discontent emerged. And it
hurt.
   The comeuppance came mainly by way of three poetry magazine
contributors _ she calls them ``aspiring critics'' _ who took issue
with her dense language and literary allusions.
   ``They were all women,'' she says. ``I guess some of them just
don't allow for throwbacks like me.''
   Some of the criticism was well-reasoned, for at times Clampitt
can be excessive in her reference to other texts or in her
language, i.e., her preference for classical traditions over the
sparse style so much in vogue.
   But, oh, some of the things they said:
   ``Clampitt is not a poet of emotional depth.''
   ``...it would be better for Amy Clampitt if, at least for a
while, she tucked her notes from Poetry 101 away in a trunk.''
   ``...all her prosodies tend to cacophony (sic).''
   Clampitt can be vague, but her work is more likely to sparkle
with the bright particulars she has enjoyed in her long romance
with the language. She can be quick in her borrowings from other
writers, but she is also a jewel thief who can pick the pockets of
Hopkins or Wordsworth when they have just what she needs. She is
stylistically somewhat outdated, but refreshingly so.
   Her poems already are finding their way into anthologies, and
many critics are talking as if her work will ``last.''
   Helen Vendler, Harvard professor and poetry critic of ``The New
Yorker,'' says in her recent book on poetry, ``The Music of What
Happens,'' that Clampitt's poetry will endure because of her rare
voice and because it ``will take on as well the documentary value
of what, in the 20th century, made up the stuff of culture.''
   Because she was discovered so late in life, most of her close
friends are much younger poets also just emerging. She is a little
cowed in the company of the established writers of her generation.
   Clampitt has been a visiting writer and lecturer at several
colleges, and is now working on more poems, occasional reviews, and
on a play about Dorothy Wordsworth.
   Her latest volume, ``Westward,'' has not received as much
attention as her earlier works, but it offers sensual delights and
is accessible to even the most casual reader.
   Turn to ``The Prairie,'' a long poem in ``Westward'' for the
spirit that imbued her. From this story of her family and the
uncertainty and hard history of working the plains, she exacts a
rugged, solemn beauty.
   ``Hard work.'' ``Hard work,'' it calls out.
   She answered the call, and still she wonders if her grandfather
would approve of her journey eastward.
   ``I feel a halfway need to justify, to whisper. `Please don't
disapprove, don't think me frivolous.'''
   He couldn't.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Gilding the Lillies in Marvell's 'Garden' </HL>
<AUTHOR> Marie Winn </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   When Boswell asked Dr. Johnson, "What is poetry?" the great man answered, "It is much easier to say what it is not." 
Until a month ago one could have said with confidence that "The Garden," a difficult and beautiful poem by the 17th-century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell, was not a poem about the interior of a fancy motor car. 
Now, however, according to fast-breaking developments in contemporary textual criticism, such a statement can no longer be made with certainty. 

   While Marvell's most popular poem, "To His Coy Mistress," is clearly about a young man trying to persuade a reluctant beauty to go to bed with him, "The Garden" is more obscure in meaning, prompting great numbers of scholars to explore its tangled thickets in papers entitled "The Garden: Marvell's Cartesian Ecstasy" and the like. 
Various schools of literary criticism have scratched at "The Garden" and described it as a poem exalting the powers of the imagination, a poem exploring the wellsprings of poetic inspiration -- that sort of thing. 
But they may have been hoeing the wrong row. 

   Recently, a variant text of "The Garden" has cropped up, so to speak, in a surprising new context -- a full-page advertisement appearing in millions of copies of Time, the New Yorker and the New York Times Magazine. 
The page shows the elegant interior of an expensive car. 
There, just slightly to the northeast of the leather-covered steering wheel, and west southwest of the burled walnut dashboard trim, are six lines from the second verse of the Marvell poem. 

   We know that these lines are by none other than Andrew Marvell because the name of the poet appears at the end where the author's name is customarily found in poetic quotations. 
We know that they are from "The Garden" because they are hauntingly similar to the verse we studied in school, the one beginning "Fair Quiet have I found thee here/And Innocence, thy sister dear?" 
But the text has undergone a weird metamorphosis: the word "comfort" has replaced "innocence" and the state of solitude once found "delicious" by the poet is now bluntly "luxurious"; thus a poem that once described a state of metaphysical bliss in which "a green thought in a green shade" surpasses all bodily pleasures, now seems to promote something cozy and sensuous, something that costs a lot of money, a wonderful British car, perhaps. 
But surely that isn't what the poet had in mind. 

   Well, that doesn't necessarily matter, according to David Greetham, executive director of the Society for Textual Scholarship and an English professor at the City University of New York. 
When asked how today's scholars might approach an altered version, Mr. Greetham described a form of advanced literary analysis known as Reception Theory, in which "authorial intention has no particular precedence. 
It is just one interpretation of many." 

   He goes on: "If, in the lines from Marvell's 'The Garden,' the car manufacturers had determined that this line is imperfect in their own view of what was necessary, then they could argue that indeed they were merely perfecting the poem and that Marvell would see that this was a better version for this particular purpose than the one he had in fact written. 
It's certainly not an unprecedented condition. 
Many famous texts have been changed in the transmission in order to give more meaning to the original lines." 

   In this case, the "transmitter" of the new variant version of "The Garden" does not deny his role. 
"Yes, I am the copywriting culprit who dared to sully the works of the great English poets," cheerfully admits Martin Macdonald, creative director with the San Francisco advertising firm of Hal Riney &amp; Partners. 
He has had his creative way not merely with Marvell, but also, in other ads, with Wordsworth, Robert Lewis Stevenson, and Hamlin Garland, a poet who can hardly add a "British, upscale atmosphere" to the advertisement, (as Mr. Macdonald puts it), since he was born and raised in Kansas. 
"I suppose Wordsworth and Marvell are spinning in their graves, but in my defense I can only say that these poets are now getting a lot more visibility. 
I was actually expecting a bit of a hue and cry from the literary world," continues Mr. Macdonald, "but so far the only mild protest I've received was from a nice lady in Teaneck, N.J., who really didn't seem too outraged at our small poetic license." 

   Not everyone in the literary world views Mr. Macdonald's variant verses with equanimity. 
Cleanth Brooks, a pioneer of the New Criticism who is now emeritus at Yale, was less than charitable when the advertisement was pointed out to him, saying, "What they've done is really rather obscene, an appeal to the baser emotions in order to sell something." 

   Aileen Ward, Schweitzer professor of the humanities at New York University, also was enraged. 
"Changing the word 'innocence' to 'comfort' is a dreadful comment on the trade-off between the real inspiration of Marvell and the debased standards that his lines are being twisted to uphold." 

   Meanwhile, Geoffrey Hartman, professor of comparative literature at Yale, takes a more benign view: "I suppose they should have said 'With apologies to Andrew Marvell.' 
But I don't really consider it a very grave infringement of morality." 

   All the critics, however, seem to believe that the lines "transmitted" by Mr. Macdonald in his advertising campaign are somehow inferior to the version that appears in anthologies. 
But in defense of the Madison Avenue redaction, Mr. Greetham invokes that venerable principle of textual criticism known as "lectio difficilior," or the more difficult reading. 
Traditional editors of ancient writers used it to choose between variant readings. 
All things being equal, they chose the more difficult version on the theory that somewhere along the line of transmission, someone had simplified a text he couldn't understand. 
Lectio difficilior lives on, somewhat distorted, in the relativistic work of certain contemporary textual scholars. 
As Mr. Greetham puts it: "An author is more likely to produce an impenetrable reading than is the transmitter of that text. 
So if one has two readings, one of which makes sense and one of which does not, then the author's is the one more likely not to make sense." 

   Surely that is what Martin Macdonald of the Hal Riney Agency saw when he recast "The Garden." 
He had the wit to recognize that a green buck makes more sense than a green thought in a green shade.

Great Britain has produced more than its share of great poets and novelists, 
and it is easily possible to visit their homes, to walk the country lanes they 
trod, to stay in their towns and villages, which now abound with bed and

Although guided tours are available, my husband and I found it more exciting -- 
and less expensive -- to strike off on our own, not knowing what adventures the 
day would bring, to discover the "scept'red isle" of our imagination that we 
first encountered in books.

Last summer, after a rainy five days in London, we rented a car and headed

We agreed that our first destination should be Henry James' home, Lamb House,

After escaping the motorway to the quieter pace of a "single carriageway," we 
approached Rye with some dismay. This once-flourishing island town, one of the 
original Cinque Ports, was actually two miles inland, due to silting of the 
harbor in the 16th Century. But the ancient hilly town, with its cobbled 
streets, was still delightful, despite the proliferation of souvenir shops. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped at a bookshop and inquired about a good place to stay and have 
dinner. The clerk suggested the Mermaid Inn, an old smugglers' haunt dating 
from 1420. We took her advice and were charmed by the graceful decor, the many 
antiques and the mullioned windows. We ordered drinks by the huge fireplace, 
then treated ourselves to a traditional dinner of roast beef, jacket potatoes 
and Yorkshire pudding. 
</P>
<P>
Next we set out to explore the historic older section of town. Then, precisely 
at the opening hour of 2 p.m., we wound our way up West Street to the top of 
the hill, where we confronted a solidly respectable, brick-fronted Georgian 
house. 
</P>
<P>
A tall door admitted us to a paneled entrance hall, where a woman at a desk 
accepted our admission fee. Her family was privileged to rent Lamb House from 
the National Trust, she told us, and it was with pride and a certain 
proprietary air that she showed the house to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we first wanted to see the study where James dictated his novels to 
his secretary. Alas, the Garden Room where he worked in summer had been 
destroyed by a German bomb in 1940, but we were welcome to browse in the Green 
Room, his winter writing room. Adjacent to it was a bedroom known as the King's 
Room because George I occupied it in 1726. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Room was smaller than we would have thought and crowded with 
mementos, photographs and books -- reminders of James' company of literary 
friends: Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells, Stephen Crane and Ford Madox Ford, all of 
whom had homes nearby and were frequent visitors. 
</P>
<P>
As we wandered about the house and the walled garden with its paths and lawn, 
its flowers and fruit trees, it was easy to see why James had fallen in love 
with it. He wrote: "The quiet, essential amiability of Lamb House only deepens 
with experience . . . All the good things that I hoped of the place have, in 
fact, properly bloomed and flourished here." From 1897 until James' death in 
1916 he wrote six novels here, among them "The Ambassadors," "The Wings of the 
Dove" and "The Golden Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
We thanked the current tenant, wishing we could trade places with her, but we 
had "promises to keep and miles to go before we sleep." The following day we 
saw Rudyard Kipling's home, Bateman's, another National Trust property, in 
nearby Burwash, another East Sussex village. 
</P>
<P>
The village had little to offer in the way of bed and breakfast, but we did 
find a farmhouse on the outskirts. The bed was concave, but no matter. We were 
served a rousing breakfast of bacon, bangers, fried tomatoes, toast and 
marmalade. After a hike through the countryside we drove the short distance to 
Bateman's, arriving at the opening hour, 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
We were impressed by the tall-chimneyed stone mansion with its grand entryway 
and extensive grounds, where Kipling lived from 1902 until his death in 1936. 
All this from the fruits of his pen. 
</P>
<P>
The living quarters were staid and unimaginative, unlike the man, reflecting 
solid middle-class respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Only in his upstairs study did he seem to take flight. There was his globe of 
the world, his maps, his books, his paintings, his guns, his sabers, his 
treasures from India. His view through large, leaded windows was of misty 
gardens and the countryside beyond. This was the ideal writer's workroom. 
Quiet, secluded. 
</P>
<P>
Our next destination lay to the west and promised a distinct contrast. After 
the vigor and thunder of Kipling, the international range of his writing, we 
were to visit the home of a quiet spinster who cooked and cleaned and sewed and 
rarely traveled beyond her tiny village. That such a confined life could 
produce elegant prose which ranks with the best in English literature is an 
enduring miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Austen lived in a modest brick house in the Hampshire village of Chawton 
15 miles northeast of Winchester, where she wrote the final versions of her six 
novels from 1805 to 1817. It bore little resemblance to the country manor we 
had imagined. Her bedroom was cramped, the other rooms unprepossessing. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of a smallish fireplace in the living room, it was impossible 
to conceive that here she had written her novels secretively on scraps of 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
She was buried in Winchester Cathedral. There, the brass tablet makes no 
mention of her novels, describing her only as the daughter of a respected local 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hardy's cottage in the county of Dorset -- a half-day's drive west -- 
was next on our list, and we doubted that he would be recalled merely as the 
son of a respected local family. Quite the contrary. Dorchester, where he lived 
and worked, and the neighboring hamlet of Higher Bockhampton where he was born, 
celebrate his genius with unabashed pride. 
</P>
<P>
There is a Hardy statue, a Hardy Room in the museum, guides to his imaginary 
county of Wessex. Hotels, restaurants and streets are named after the 
characters and settings in his novels. A National Trust gift shop overflows 
with his prose and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Max Gate, the home in Dorchester where Hardy spent his mature years, is not 
open to the public, so we drove three miles northeast of the city to the 
cottage where he lived until he was 30. The approach from the car park was a 
10-minute walk through Thorncombe Wood to a picture-post card thatched cottage 
and a garden in riotous bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was born in 1840 in this house built by his grandfather, who, like his 
father, was a stonemason. Hardy walked to school in Dorchester, which he called 
Casterbridge in his novels. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to an architect and later pursued his 
architectural studies in London. After marrying, he moved to various towns to 
work on projects, finally returning in his 40s to Dorchester, where he died in 
1928. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of Hardy's cottage is less attractive than the exterior. The rooms 
are small, with low ceilings. A steep staircase leads upstairs and, in a tiny 
bedroom overlooking the garden, is the deep window seat where he wrote "Under 
the Greenwood Tree" and "Far from the Madding Crowd." 
</P>
<P>
We took a different walk back to our car. Lazing along fragrant country lanes, 
passing houses with signs offering eggs, herbs and honey, we reveled in Hardy's 
landscape. We were tempted to gather wildflowers, but they would wilt long 
before we arrived that evening at the elegant country hotel where, for once, we 
had made reservations. We were to be guests that night in the former home of 
William Wordsworth and his sister, Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
It was a circuitous route to Alfoxton Park, near Holford in Somerset. In this 
handsome, two-story Queen Anne country house, Wordsworth began his great 
creative period in 1797-98. 
</P>
<P>
Amid 50 acres of woodland set in a hollow of the Quantock Hills, Alfoxton had 
everything. Even the modern swimming pool and tennis court did not detract from 
the tranquillity. Quince vines climbed the white walls. Herb and vegetable 
gardens flourished. Chicken, geese, pigs, sheep and cattle were raised in 
adjoining pens and fields for the hotel's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The bar was a wondrously inviting, dark-paneled room that had once been 
Wordsworth's study. As the tables filled, a wispy elderly woman paused 
uncertainly at the empty chair beside us. We invited her to join us. 
</P>
<P>
She was a Bristol University professor researching a book on Wordsworth, and 
she regaled us with stories about William and Dorothy. They had moved to 
Alfoxton to be near Samuel Coleridge, who lived three miles away in Nether 
Stowey. 
</P>
<P>
Coleridge's cottage was now a museum, according to the professor. There he 
wrote "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and "Kubla Khan." It was a happy time 
for him, all too brief in his tormented life. 
</P>
<P>
Wales was our next stop. That mythic land of lilting voices, song and fable had 
long appealed to us and we were eager to explore the countryside described by 
its most famous poet, Dylan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in a twilight traffic jam in Swansea, we barely made it before dark to 5 
Cwmdonkin Drive, where the poet was born in 1914 and spent his first 20 years. 
The house is not open to the public, so we hurried on to the nearby seaside 
resort area, called The Mumbles, and the Mermaid Hotel, a drinking haunt of 
Thomas', where we planned to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' carousing was legendary. An ancient barmaid at the Mermaid had known 
the poet. "A loud, rough sort," she said, "but he could charm the birds out of 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning we drove to Laugharne (pronounced Larn), celebrated as 
Llareggub in "Under Milkwood." It is a weathered town built on a hill slope, 
with streets leading down to an old harbor. Thomas loved the town when he first 
saw it in 1934, and kept returning there, spending the last 4 1/2 years of his 
life at The Boathouse with his wife, Caitlin. 
</P>
<P>
To fortify ourselves for the half-mile walk to The Boathouse we stopped at 
Brown's Hotel, the poet's favorite pub, for a Buckley Best Bitter. The publican 
had been a friend of Dylan's and pointed out the table in the corner where he 
and Caitlin always sat -- and argued. 
</P>
<P>
We found our way to Dylan's Walk just outside town, and paused at his writing 
shed. The former garage, which he called "My Shack," was sparsely furnished 
with a deal table and chairs. But the view across the estuary was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the path, The Boathouse -- "my seashaken house on a breakneck of 
rocks" -- seemed to grow out of the cliff face. It has been almost too lovingly 
restored by the Carmarthen District Council with some of the original 
furnishings. The orderly rooms are out of character. One cannot imagine the 
untidy, temperamental Thomases staging one of their classic brawls in such 
immaculate surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
We browsed in the book shop, studied the photographic display in the bedrooms 
and stopped for tea and Welsh cakes in the former dining room. Later, standing 
in front of his grave in the town's St. Martin's churchyard, we were surprised 
by the simple wording of the inscription on the white cross -- "In Memory of 
Dylan Thomas, died November 9, 1953. RIP" 
</P>
<P>
It lacked a poet's touch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not go gentle into that good night, 
</P>
<P>
 Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
</P>
<P>
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light." 
</P>
<P>
 Laugharne was the westernmost point and the last stop on our literary odyssey. 
Time to head back to Heathrow, drop off the car and await our flight to Los 
Angeles. As we sped along the M4 our minds, like Robert Browning's in his poem, 
shifted to "Home Thoughts, from Abroad."

   The Grand Vizier of Poetry

   Poor Goethe, a marble statue in German town squares
forever bestowing smiling wisdom, brings to Anglophone minds
the inexhaustible author of "Faust," endless and incoherent,
the creator of the first teenage-suicide fad thanks to "The
Sorrows of Young Werther," and a polymath dubiously
pontificating on rocks and optics and chromaticism and love
and nature. It is off-putting. And it is unfair.
   Rescue of a sort is at hand in a huge new
life-and-time-and-works biography by Nicholas Boyle, whose
first installment, which has just appeared, gets us through
half the life: "Goethe, the Poet and the Age: Volume 1, the
Poetry of Desire, 1749-1790" (Oxford University Press, 807
pages, $30). Mr. Boyle, a fellow and tutor at Magdalen
College, Cambridge, spreads before us the fragmented but
awakening Germany where Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born
in 1749 to a rich but professionally disappointed bureaucrat
and a lively, loving mother in Frankfurt. A pampered, happy
eldest child, little Goethe was tutored at home until he went
off to college in "Parisian" Leipzig. College brought on, as
college will, acute attacks of yearning, eroticism,
religiosity and verse (mostly later burnt). Then came law
school in Strasbourg, where he discovered nature (long walks
in the Vosges), German philosophy (he found Herder the most
congenial), atheism (he was to stay a lifelong anti-Christian
"pagan") and sex (he guiltily jilted a local girl).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Back home in the early 1770s, equipped with a law degree,
he found his voice, or rather his voices -- his extraordinary
and, until Rilke, unchallenged inner oneness with the German
language. He began writing remarkable poetry: dithyrambs such
as "Prometheus" that anticipate both the excited, sweeping
energy of Shelley and the ecstatic precision of Hopkins; and
alongside them simple, stark ballads that remind us of
Wordsworth or Coleridge. He started "Faust" around then and,
although he was to go on reworking and expanding it until his
death in 1832, this "Urfaust" involving the original story of
the forsaken love, infanticide and execution of poor Gretchen
turned out to be the best part of the whole gigantic edifice,
bringing Goethe's cheery pantheistic optimism face to face
with evil and tragedy. But it was rather the hysterical cult
that developed around the maudlin novella "Werther" that made
Goethe the first true literary celebrity. He spent the rest
of his life pestered by "Werther" fans.
   In 1775 Goethe made his career move; he accepted the
invitation of Duke Carl August, ruler of tiny Weimar, to come
be councilor/minister/poet laureate/tutor/grand vizier. Here
he stayed essentially the rest of his life, a cherished and
petted courtier. He had a long, tormentedly platonic affair
with a married court lady, Charlotte von Stein. He enjoyed
court life, planned some plays, but also squirmed restlessly.
   The solution was one of history's most famous vacations:
Goethe's two-year trip to Italy in 1786-88, "the land where
the lemon trees bloom." Italy was revelation and catharsis:
Palladio, Raphael and Michelangelo (though Goethe loathed
their Christian subjects), Vesuvius, swarming Naples, and,
above all, Rome, where for two years he watched papal
ceremonies, studied art and had lots of undemanding sex. His
writing block dissolved: He tackled "Faust" again, this time
tacking on the odd concept of Faust as a kind of summa of the
human race.
   Back in Weimar in 1788, Goethe, now 39, met the woman of
his life: Christiane Vulpius, 23, from a marginal, literate
-- but -- scrimping Micawberesque family. Goethe installed
the spunky, no-nonsense woman in his home (no actual wedding;
mild local buzz) and soon had a son. His work thrived: He
finished his best play, "Tasso," all about the stresses of
being a great, mad poet in a backbiting, uncomprehending
court. Above all, he wrote "Roman Elegies," 20 poems loosely
modeled on Latin erotic poets like Propertius and Ovid but
wholly original in essence, fusing Goethe's new marital
happiness with his memories of Rome.
   They tell, in 20 vignettes, the short history of an
intense affair between a traveling German poet and a buoyant
Roman lass who likes to flirt in public by drawing the poet's
initials in wine on the table; he enjoys tapping out the
meters of the poems he's writing on her naked back in bed.
These amazing, humorous, ironic poems are full of the sounds
and smells of Rome, and the quality of light at different
times of day. Along with Byron's "Don Juan" and Pushkin's
"Eugene Onegin," both considerably later, the "Roman Elegies"
comprise a trilogy of brilliantly erotic Romantic narrative
verse -- a genre that might itself seem a paradox to those
who think of Romanticism as involving merely windy rhapsodies
and self-absorbed verbosities. In 1789 Goethe returned to
Italy, found he hated it, could think only of Christiane and
little August, and wrote the nasty, often funny "Venetian
Epigrams" mocking the tackiness of it all.
   Mr. Boyle leaves Goethe back home, a purring paterfamilias
of 41. Mr. Boyle's labors are never less than intelligent and
eloquent; he discriminates and points to the living and
enjoyable Goethe. For those embarking on a long sea voyage
and wanting to know all about Goethe, he is a reliable
companion. But the less-leisured may wish to turn to the
Penguin "Goethe: Selected Verse." A variegated selection from
plays, epics and lyrics, big and small, light and heavy, and
preceded by David Luke's ample introduction, it offers the
remedy for Goethe the bore -- not Goethe the man, however
richly presented, but Goethe the thrilling, witty and sexy
poet.

   The telephone company launched a new service for
culture-lovers Monday _ Dial-a-Poem.
   For 70 cents a minute, British Telecom's customers can hear
five-minute recordings of leading poets reciting their verse.
   Callers dialing 0898-222255 could hear John Heath-Stubbs, 70,
saying: ``I'm very happy to be the first poet to be recorded in
this dial-a-poem series,'' before reciting from four of his poems,
ranging in subject matter from Noah's Ark through cats in poetry to
clocks and space.
   Heath-Stubbs is among six contemporary poets chosen for
Dial-a-Poem.
   It's too soon to tell whether the innovation will confound the
19th-century historian Thomas Macaulay's conviction that ``as
civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.'' But
something clearly is astir.
   The London subway has beun displaying verses of Shelley, Burns
and de la Mare on some of its trains, and a year ago the railroad
company organized poetry readings at some of its stations.
   Sarah Chesney of the English Language Society, the literary
group that selected the poets for Dial-a-Poem, explained in a
telephone interview: ``We felt we should make poetry more
accessible.''
   Added Lisa Bourne, a British Telecom spokeswoman: ``Poetry was
slowly fading away, and we thought it would be a great idea to
bring it back.''
   State-owned until it was floated on the stock market in 1984,
British Telecom is ever on the lookout for a profit-making
sideline, and it said that if Dial-a-Poem attracted 1,000 calls a
week, it would make the service permanent.
   Others poets reading their verse for telephone callers during
the six-week trial run are Kathleen McPhilemy, Jeremy Reed, Bernard
Kops, James Berry and Gillian Allnutt.
   ``We wanted something refreshingly adventurous _ poetry that is
not so obscure that it doesn't come across well on the phone, but
that is also not strictly traditional,'' said Ms. Chesney.
   She said each poet would receive 10 percent of the profits from
the service.
   One problem is British Telecom's phone lines, which aren't
famous for their clarity. Heath-Stubbs came through somewhat
faintly and would only be comprehensible in a quiet room.
   ``I don't think the telephone does the poets justice in a way
that hearing them firsthand would,'' Ms. Chesney said. ``But many
people won't have the chance to hear them firsthand, and for them
it's refreshing to hear them (the poets) in their own voices.''
   To listen to Heath-Stubbs' entire five minutes costs $3.45
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. But a cheaper rate during slack hours
brings the cost down to $2.25. A sampling from Heath-Stubbs's ``The
Cosmic Clock'':
   Planets, stars, galaxies _ the whole
   Winking and blinking caboodle _
   This, it seems, is the only reliable clock:
   A beam from a star crossed a sensitive plate _
   Then came the pips: the British nation
   Turned on the 10 o'clock news.
   
   This is the moving image of eternity _
   I don't mean Paley's watch discarded
   By the absconding Watchmaker
   Upon a bank of Wordsworthian daffodils,
   But pulsars, quasars, decaying elements, black holes;
   Yet this, they say, is likewise winding down _
   And hickory _ dickory, men and mice we run in it!

<TEXT>
THIS week the Poetry Society hosted a tribute to Sidney Keys, a poet who
died exactly 50 years ago in the Tunisian Campaign at the age of 20, just
two weeks into his active service. The evening was as much a meeting of old
friends and an opportunity to exchange reminiscences as an account of the
poet's life and work. Keys' editor Michael Meyer and the poet John
Heath-Stubbs were the presenters. Both men had been friends of Keys at
Oxford, where he read history for five terms until the war beckoned.
Their memories of half a century ago were impressively sharp. According to
Meyer, Keys, although a man who tended to prefer the companionship of books
to that of the living, was amiable enough - if at times a little dour.
In 1941, Meyer and Keys edited a volume of undergraduate poetry together
entitled Eight Oxford Poets. Keys excluded from it the work of another
Oxford contemporary, Philip Larkin, on the grounds of quality - a judgment
with which the wearisomely uncritical Andrew Motion, Larkin's official
biographer, concurs. This painful exclusion caused Larkin to speak with
bitterness of Keys, and to denigrate his reputation, until the end of his
life.
Keys worked hard at his poetry and had developed a mature voice and manner
by the time of his death. He described himself in a late letter as 'an
uncomfortable metaphysical without roots', who would rather have been born
in 19th century Oxfordshire than near London between the wars. That remark
draws attention both to his achievements as a nature poet in the manner of
Clare and Wordsworth, and to his interests in philosophy and symbolism,
where his masters were the German poet Rilke and WB Yeats. Keys wrote much
about death as his own approached, borrowing from Rilke the idea that it is
a creature that lives within us with whom it is necessary to come to terms.
In fact, his poetry as a whole wrestles as much with ghosts and angels as it
does with men - which strikes the reader as strangely, if not disturbingly,
premonitory.
'Poets who die in battle tend to get praised for the wrong reasons,
especially by elderly non-combatants,' quipped Meyer. Sidney Keys, though
sentimentalised after his death, has not so much been praised for the wrong
reasons as largely forgotten, which is an injustice because his poetry at
its best has enduring qualities and his war poetry, though none of it
written during his brief period of active service, was driven, like Wilfred
Owen's, by an identification with the helpless conscript.
Michael Mayer, a powerful, stocky man who squares up to the lectern like an
old-time pugilist, read the poems in a gruff, driving baritone. It was a
reading quickened and rendered that much more poignant by his own fond
memories of a long-dead friend who had 'an inner sanctum to which I couldn't
penetrate'.
It is three years since Sinclair-Stevenson launched its own poetry list, and
the publication of four new titles was celebrated by a reading - also at the
Poetry Society - this month. It was an eclectic occasion: the poet John
Fuller read the last poems of his father (who died last year) with a dry,
donnish restraint which seemed entirely appropriate to the material: casual
philosophical reveries that explored such themes as the mysteries of the
energies of art and the paradoxes of old age. These poems are the products
of a mind taking wing after the third drink of the evening as dusk begins to
settle over suburban Blackheath.
The best of Sinclair-Stevenson's new poets was undoubtedly William Scammell
 -who is scarcely a new poet at all, being 54 years old and having already
published six collections. Scammell is a poet of wit and fixed intellectual
convictions whose work encompasses politics, literature - and being a
Lakesman, landscape poetry. Scammell looks boozy and disreputable; and he
has put all this broad experience of life to good use in his robust,
inventive and iconoclastic verse.
Roy Fuller's Last Poems and William Scammell's Five Easy Pieces are
published by Sinclair-Stevenson at Pounds 14.99 and Pounds 7.99
respectively.

AROUND THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES; 
</P>
<P>
WRITER'S BLOCK BY ZACHARY LEADER (THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS: $26.95; 
313 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
When he was a graduate student sweating out his dissertation on Blake, Zachary 
Leader got the idea for this multidisciplinary exploration of writer's block. 
This dread literary ailment afflicts lowly Ph.D. candidates no less than great 
authors, often driving victims crazy or to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Coleridge took opium. Hemingway shot himself. Leader took himself in hand and 
wrote what may be the first book on the subject that doesn't attempt to be 
helpful; it is a theoretical and historical account, bristling with footnotes 
and erudition, none of it intended to increase your productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Leader, a lecturer in English at London's Roehampton Institute, raises 
a series of questions about writer's block: "At what point -- and why -- did 
the term come into existence, and what were the terms it replaced? How was it 
to be distinguished from the sorts of difficulties most writers encounter in 
the act of composition? When, in other words, did a problem with writing become 
a block?" 
</P>
<P>
Leader looks for answers in psychology and literary history, "but also in a 
long philosophical tradition of distrust of the written word as well as in more 
general social and cultural speculation." He covers a great deal of very rugged 
ground, quoting an eclectic assortment of thinkers, ranging from Plato and 
Melville to Mark Twain and Julia Kristeva. 
</P>
<P>
The term "writers block" was coined in 1947 by Dr. Edmund Bergler, a largely 
ignored but extremely prolific psychoanalyst who published 25 books and more 
than 300 articles before his death in 1962. By then the phrase had entered the 
language, spread by word of mouth, a sign of a time in America of intense faith 
in psychoanalysis and intense psychoanalytic interest in creativity. These 
origins explain "the air of medical substance, of a treatable condition, 
assumed by writer's block; hence also the suspicion of something bogus or 
unearned about its claims." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its connection to a particular place and time, a writer like Philip 
Roth might think of himself as blocked, while Philip Larkin, who wrote no more 
than four poems a year, simply considered himself unprolific. Earlier writers 
"dried up" or "froze" or were "stuck in a rut," metaphors that imply internal 
deficiency, rather than external impediment, as the source of the trouble. 
Locating this outside the individual shifts responsibility away from the self. 
No doubt this is one reason "writer's block" caught on. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you call it block, desiccation, frigidity or stasis, it's hell on 
Earth. The complaint entered literary history in the 18th Century, according to 
one theory, when modern technology -- paper and the press -- inundated writers 
with the work of their betters. Since Shakespeare and Milton are tough acts to 
follow, Romantic poets suffered from "the remorseless deepening of 
self-consciousness before the rich and intimidating legacy of the past." They 
lost the power to write, and made that a subject of literature. When truly 
stuck, they invented the fragment as a poetic form. 
</P>
<P>
The new self-consciousness of the mid-18th Century also may be interpreted as 
just one episode in the recurring history of writerly difficulty, which goes 
back at least to the acedia suffered by medieval authors. Then as now, it was 
considered a sin, although an unenjoyable one. 
</P>
<P>
The book also focuses on various psychoanalytic explanations of creative 
inhibition, emphasizing Freud, several post-Freudians and especially the 
British Object-Relations school, which explains blockage in terms of unresolved 
conflict between the primitive internal forces involved in 
self-differentiation. 
</P>
<P>
Leader stresses the affinities between post-Kleinian theory and the testimony 
of Wordsworth and Coleridge, the great bards of blockage. He analyzes a number 
of Wordsworth texts -- including the first 285 lines of the "Prelude," which 
are explicitly about being unable to write -- and details the extravagant 
agonies that led Coleridge to plagiarism and worse. Coleridge's poetry, 
particularly "Dejection: An Ode," documents his struggles, as do his notebooks 
and letters. In one of many tormented moments, the poet wrote a friend, "I wish 
I had been a tanner." 
</P>
<P>
After his consideration of these psychological, historical, and literary 
aspects of his subject, Leader adds a sociological dimension with a discussion 
of the cultural taboos that may produce blockage, devoting a chapter to women 
writers and theories about them. 
</P>
<P>
This approach is coherent but arbitrary, since the themes that emerge are 
dictated by the author's choices. These reflect his interests and a 
predilection for complexity, as when he summarily dismisses non-psychoanalytic 
psychology as "theoretically threadbare." 
</P>
<P>
This book is knotty as a Persian rug, and will be of interest primarily to 
scholars of psychoanalysis and literature. Writers avoiding the blank page 
might be better off with Mozart, though Leader's analysis is finally 
encouraging. Creative impairment "can be a necessary precursor to health," he 
concludes. "Blockage itself can bring insight, and with it the power to write."

Will China's protesters produce a Madison -- a constitutionalist, a codifier of 
liberty -- before there emerges a Napoleon whose riposte to philosophy is 
artillery? Probably not. But a 20th-Century Chinese thinker said when asked the 
significance of the French Revolution, "Too soon to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on 1989 from, say 2005, as Wordsworth looked back on 1789 from 
1805, many Chinese, young no more, will surely think, "Bliss was it in that 
dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven!" However, many may then feel 
as Wordsworth did about the long gone "hour of universal ferment" when "the 
soil of common life (was) too hot to tread upon." They may say as he did, "Now 
do I feel how I have been deceived."

   Willard Spiegelman, perhaps best known in these quarters
as the Leisure &amp; Arts page's man in Dallas, spends his days
professing English at Southern Methodist University, editing
the Southern Review and writing about poetry, notably
Wordsworth. Lately, however, he has been turning his mind to
poets of his own time. The result is "The Didactic Muse:
Scenes of Instruction in Contemporary American Poetry"
(Princeton, 278 pages, $39.50 cloth, $10.95 paper).
   While Mr. Spiegelman brings a scholar's precision to this
work, he has obviously been at pains to open up the subject
for outsiders, as it were, by showing how the eight writers
he has chosen all have set themselves up as teachers in their
poems. This is something of a radical notion, joining such
apparently unrelated temperaments as the Beat standard bearer
Allen Ginsberg and the patrician James Merrill to a chain of
pedagogic forebears stretching back to the Vergil of the
"Georgics."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The more immediate mentor of this lyrically educative gang
is W.H. Auden, whose "easy speech," Mr. Spiegelman says,
sounds like meditation "at random" but actually propounds
serious lessons about the state of the world. From Auden, the
analysis proceeds from poet to poet, construing their very
different work as a rhetoric of instruction and
argumentation. If this sounds arid in summary, in the doing
it becomes a didactic revelation, a literal introduction or
leading-in to some great writers, the best of them often
misunderstood.
   Adrienne Rich benefits most from this approach. Although
few readers of this feminist poet will be surprised to see
her treated as a didactic, many will be amazed to see how
what may have looked like artless preaching actually gets its
power from an eminently calculated and interesting rhetoric.
As Mr. Spiegelman shows, one of Ms. Rich's characteristic
methods is to make a point with lists (a feature of didactic
poetry as old as Homer's catalog of Greek ships). A woman in
the poem "Transcendental Etude" goes off by herself to the
kitchen and fusses quietly with "bits of yarn, calico and
velvet scraps,/laying them out absently on the scrubbed
boards/in the lamplight, with small rainbow-colored
shells/sent in cotton-wool from somewhere far away/and skeins
of milkweed from the nearest meadow . . ."
   Such poetry -- really all serious poetry -- has only a
handful of readers today, perhaps because in a previous
generation, T.S. Eliot and the other high modernists cut
themselves off from the large public poetry had always had
before. The more recent landscape of verse is not nearly such
a dark wood, but its paths need mapping. Mr. Spiegelman has
been working at this task in a timely way, then, and a direct
benefit could accrue from his efforts to Anthony Hecht, whose
complete works have just been republished as "Collected
Earlier Poems" (Knopf, 288 pages, $22.95), along with a new
volume, "The Transparent Man" (Knopf, 96 pages, $18.95). Mr.
Spiegelman also makes it his central task to clarify the
importance of Mr. Merrill's encyclopedic long poem, "The
Changing Light at Sandover," declaring that it "has
permanently altered the course of American poetry for the
rest of our century."
   ---
   No one needs to be persuaded that management is important
or taught that business's ignore it at their peril. The
difficulty, in a way oddly parallel to the problem of talking
cogently about poetry, is to find a rhetoric, a way into
writing about the subject that will not strike the
intelligent reader as empty, jejune, bombastic or all three
at once. David Asman's job, as editor of this newspaper's
"Manager's Journal" column since 1983, has been to solve this
problem. Now he has edited "The Wall Street Journal on
Managing: Adding Value Through Synergy" (Doubleday Currency,
256 pages, $19.95). All of the essays originally appeared in
the "Manager's Journal," but they have been re-edited for
this book and brought up-to-date, to take into account late
developments in the economy and a rapidly changing
geopolitical setting.

SELECTED POEMS Derek Mahon Viking Pounds 14.00. 194 pages
LOVE IN A LIFE Andrew Motion Faber Pounds 11.99 hardback, Pounds 4.99
paperback, 62 pages
LIKE LOUIS MacNeice, Derek Mahon is an Irish poet (born in Belfast, 1941)
who eludes characterisation by his Irishness. His subjects are general, his
sensibility is that shared by all poets whose primary interest is in making
a variety of verbal objects and thereby, as he writes in the MacNeice
memorial poem which heads this new selection, 'keeping the colours new'.
Mahon's Irish interests are not repressed - in fact they are abounding; but
unlike his near-contemporary Seamus Heaney or Paul Muldoon (another devotee
of MacNeice) he does not seek to create an Irish myth of any sort.
Interested in everything, and infallibly interesting, he is simply and
thoroughly a poet in a way that not only recalls MacNeice, but the
distinctions of Auden, Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop too.
Like all those poets he is blessed with technical accomplishment. His
management of metrics, stanza and rhyme, his sure sense of the fine,
ringing, quirky, inevitable line, his eager appetite for, and seemingly
instant command of, new forms set him apart from most of his English and
American contemporaries, and they, on the whole, are a brilliant lot.
Reading through this book - his second selected volume, but with the feel of
a 'Collected' - one cannot fail to admire Mahon's knack of being himself in
whatever formal guise he adopts, be it epigram, short lyric, verse letter,
villanelle, dramatic monologue, free translation (Ovid, Corbiere, Rimbaud,
Pasternak, Jaccottet) or big stanza-statement poem. Every piece here is
fully achieved; the ambition behind the book must be enormous but is never
obtrusive.
Beyond the attributes of technique there is in Mahon's best poems an
endlessly ponderable richness of language, a sense of which may be gained
from the opening stanza of his most celebrated piece, 'A Disused Shed in Co.
Wexford': 'Even now there are places where a thought might grow - /Peruvian
mines, worked out and abandoned /To a slow clock of condensation, /An echo
trapped for ever, and a flutter /Of wild-flowers in the lift-shaft, /Indian
compounds where the wind dances /And a door bangs with diminished
confidence, /Lime crevices behind rippling rain-barrels, /Dog corners for
bone burials; /And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford'.
This poem expands on what might be thought of as Mahon's principal theme:
the pathos of discarded things, the poetry of the contingency of everyday
objects. 'Left to itself,' he writes in 'Disused Shed's' sister-poem, 'A
Garage in Co. Cork', 'the functional will cast /A death-bed glow of
picturesque abandon'. The poet's visionary task is no longer to descry
Wordsworth's noble 'light that never was, on sea or land', so much as to
notice the 'late sacramental gleam' with which the most mediocre bits and
pieces of life will start to shine.
'We might be anywhere but are in one place only', he insists in this
Elizabeth Bishop-like reverie on an obscure, mundane filling-station, into
which he nevertheless manages to work, and charmingly, the Ovidian myth of
Philemon and Baucis. 'A god who spent the night here once rewarded /Natural
courtesy with eternal life - /Changing to petrol pumps, that they be spared/
For ever there, an old man and his wife'.
It is one of the triumphs of Mahon's art that for all his resolute attention
to the ordinary, he can be 'myth-kitty' in a powerfully plausible way to
which Philip Larkin who coined the phrase could not reasonably have
objected, as when in the book's grand finale, 'Death and the Sun', he
imagines 'Plato's neolithic troglodyte /Released from his dark cinema'
standing at last, 'Absurd and anxious, out in the open air', while (in a
wonderful concluding flow of mixed metaphor) the 'Sun gongs its lenity from
a brazen heaven /Listening in silence to his rich despair'.
If Mahon in this hugely enjoyable gathering of poems shows himself to be
free from any Irish stereotyping, the quintessentially English poet Andrew
Motion in his bleakly impressive new collection, Love in a Life, gives the
impression of wanting to emulate the linguistic violence and tonal daring of
his Irish contemporaries Paul Muldoon and Tom Paulin. A bitter colloquialism
constantly threatens the poised lyrical structures of the book's three short
sections and actually causes 'The Vision of that Ancient Man' to abort: it
ends 'like . . . Sod it; who cares?'
But in breaking with traditional values, Motion gives striking expression to
a burdened breadwinner's view of the modern world as endlessly aggravating,
rawly inhospitable. The sad old whippet in 'It is an Offence' who regularly
leaves his 'sloped, weary turds' by the poet's front door 'doesn't know he's
doing, and yet /I'd still like to cover his arsehole with quick-set cement'.
That is very much the mood of the book.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Master of patriotic verse - This biography reinstates
the true value of Tennyson's poetry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENNYSON by Peter Levi Macmillan Pounds 20, 370 pages
SLIGHTLY more than 100 years ago, in October 1892, Tennyson had the biggest,
most public funeral of any English poet - a spectacular ceremonial in
Westminster Abbey with survivors of the Light Brigade lining the aisle. It
was an appropriate final tribute to a poet whose work had penetrated every
literate household in the land. What other poem has ever become so
inextricably interwoven with history and national pride as The Charge of the
Light Brigade?
When the Duke of Wellington died, Tennyson (who had been appointed Poet
Laureate two years earlier in 1850 on the death of Wordsworth) wrote: 'Bury
the Great Duke/ With an empire's lamentation,/ Let us bury the Great Duke/
To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation . . .' It was an Ode in
which Tennyson gave robust patriotic expression to the Victorian moral
outlook in the famous couplet: 'Not once or twice in our fair island-story,/
The path of duty was the way to glory . . .'
Most of the time today we apprehend poetry, when we bother with it at all,
privately, almost secretly, through the eyes, listening to the sound of the
words only with the mind's ear. That is quite different from the way
Tennyson and his contemporaries listened to poetry. For them it was read
aloud regularly as part of general and parlour entertainment. Tennyson's
contemporary Browning perfected the notion of a poem as a histrionic
monologue. Even a poem-sequence stemming from a deep sense of personal loss
like In Memoriam was conceived in terms of public utterance.
Peter Levi, a poet himself, is highly sensitive to this aspect of Tennyson.
and reminds us of it when commenting on the poems. His biography of the poet
comes in the wake of several previous ones in recent years, such as Robert
Bernard Martin's Tennyson: The Unquiet Heart (1983) and Michael Thorn's
Tennyson (reviewed here last year). There have also been published during
the past decade three volumes of The Letters of Alfred Tennyson and in 1969
there was a truly complete edition of the poetry with copious biographical
notes on each poem edited by Christopher Ricks.
The basic facts, then, are not in dispute and Levi has no tremendous
revelations to unfold. His fresh light arises from his more erudite
discoveries - a copy of the Post Homerica of Quintus of Smyrna inscribed in
Greek (by Arthur Hallam he surmises) to Tennyson and providing him with the
source for the sequel to Oenone. We read once more of the poet's upbringing
as the fourth son of a drunken Lincolnshire rector, and of his attendance at
Louth Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was one of the
earliest members of the Apostles debating society.
He went down from the university with the Chancellor's Gold Medal for his
poem Timbuctoo but without a degree. He made his poetic debut in 1827 in the
slim volume, Poems by Two Brothers, a joint venture with his sibling
Charles. Then in 1830 came Poems, Chiefly Lyrical of which he was the sole
author. It was cruelly savaged by that notorious literary hatchet-man of the
period JW Croker - 'Croaker', Levi aptly calls him - in the Quarterly
Review. And as if this was not enough misery, a tragic blow followed when an
urgent letter from abroad informed Tennyson that his great Cambridge friend
Hallam (who was engaged to be married to his sister Emily) had died of
apoplexy in Vienna.
Levi discounts the view taken afterwards by Tennyson that, had his other
friends not supported him at this time of crisis with their praise of his
work, he would have given up poetry altogether. In the event he began In
Memoriam soon after his friend's death and he continued to draft poems
treating of the legends of Camelot. Levi dates the emergence of Tennyson as
a great poet to this period.
For those of us who belong to a generation whose taste for Tennyson was
systematically poisoned, first by reading TS Eliot's complaint that he
'ruminated' tediously, and then by the strictures of FR Leavis, the
deeply-felt responses in this book are a pleasingly corrective experience.
Levi rates the song 'Tears, idle tears' as a 'sad and perfect lyric'. That
was the very poem Leavis made the spearhead of his attack, contrasting it,
much to its disadvantage, with a more poised poem of regret by DH Lawrence.
But Levi discriminates too. He suggests that The Idylls of the King are
fatally flawed and most of them should be read quickly if at all. He feels
that the best part of The Princess is the Prologue, with its description of
an open day in summer in the grounds of Park House for the members of the
Maidstone Mechanics Institute. (The funfair scenes in Ken Russell's recent
and notorious production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida were
ultimately derived from this instance of Tennyson's descriptive skill).
The plays Levi regards as more or less unreadable and certainly
unperformable; but he thinks that Maud (severely panned by George Eliot when
it first appeared) is 'a powerfully impressive poem'. He finds in it 'a very
full and fully sexual expression of love, which as a younger and unmarried
man Tennyson could not have written (there he differs from Tolstoy)'. It is
these bizarre throwaway comparisons that have such a salutary effect on the
reader; like the book as a whole, they send one straight back to the poems.

COLLECTED POEMS 1945-1990
by R S Thomas
Dent Pounds 25, 548 pages
CYMRU OR WALES?
by R S Thomas
Gomer Pounds 3.75, 32 pages
HENRY VAUGHAN, David Jones, Vernon Watkins, Dylan Thomas, R S Thomas - there
is a continuing tradition of Welsh poets who write in English, and English
poetry would be much impoverished without them. Sometimes their work has its
origin in native Welsh experience, like Watkins's Ballad of the Mari Lwyd;
at others it stems from the poet's sense of being a part of a European
tradition with roots in classical Greece and Rome, as may be seen in the
many fine translations that Watkins made into English verse from Homer,
Dante, Ronsard, Baudelaire, Goethe, Rilke.
There is a similar double-vision in the work of R S Thomas, who celebrated
his 80th birthday on March 29 with a massive volume containing his poetic
output over the best part of half a century. In many of the poems Thomas
appears as the poet of rural Wales, portraying individually named
farm-workers, their wives and children, the inhabitants of his parish, seen
against a sharply etched background. One figure constantly recurs - Iago
Prytherch, the labourer, a Welsh Piers Plowman, whose harsh life Thomas
never tires of describing.
Yet there are also many poems in the R S Thomas canon that transport the
reader far from Welsh concerns. Kierkegaard and Wallace Stevens are two
non-Welshmen who ignite Thomas's muse; so do many French painters. One of
his recent books, Ingrowing Thoughts (1985) was entirely devoted to poems
based on modern art, starting with Picasso and Matisse, concluding with
Magritte, Max Ernst and Roland Penrose. Whether he is writing about a Welsh
milkmaid or Matisse's 'Portrait of a Girl in a Yellow Dress', Thomas's
approach remains the same. He stands back from the object of his
contemplation, recreating its appearance in carefully structured words, and
letting it serve, by the close, as a general reflection on the human
condition. The language is austere, the rhymes sparse, the mood often
bitter.
For much of his life Thomas wrote his poetry while serving as a minister of
the Church, in 1936 at Chirk on the Welsh border, and then among the hill
farmers of Montgomeryshire; but the reader who expects a God-centred
lyricism, hymning the Welsh countryside, will be disappointed. It was that
other Thomas - Dylan - who composed odes in praise of innocence and sunshine
at harvest-time, who sang of 'the round Zion of the waterbead and the
synagogue of the ear of corn', not this one. By contrast Rev Thomas watches
his parishioner Evans, 'On his way to the fields, where he hoes/ up one roe
of mangolds and down/ The next one' and just in case we should be so foolish
as to think that the poet is glorifying Evans as some kind of latter-day
Wordsworthian solitary, he adds: 'You needn't wonder/ What goes on in his
mind, there is nothing/ Going on there . . . '
To find Thomas's sense of a connection between his two careers, the Church
and literature, one needs to consult the introduction he made in 1967 to his
selection from the poetry of George Herbert. He speaks there of: 'The
possibility of a fruitful relationship between Christianity and poetry. The
bridge between the two latter is the Incarnation. If poetry is concerned
with the concrete and the particular, then Christianity aims at their
redemption and consecration. The poet invents the metaphor, and the
Christian lives it'.
These complementary approaches to human suffering act together in his own
work and underlie a dialogue that runs right through it. Thomas finds it
difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile himself to the miserable and
often futile lives of the ordinary men and women in his pastoral care. 'The
great problems,' he writes in one characteristically short laconic poem,
'Remain, stubborn, unsolved'.
One of the saddest tasks a priest has to perform is to be present at the
deathbed of one of his flock whom he has known and loved. Father Gerard
Manley Hopkins watched the farrier Felix Randall 'pining, pining' until,
wasted with disease, he died. But then, miraculously, that poem did end on a
redemptive note, as Hopkins remembered Felix as he was formerly, full of
health and strength, and making for 'the great grey drayhorse his bright and
battering sandal]'
In Thomas's poem 'The Mill' he describes how he would pay regular visits to
a miller confined to his bed for nine years before he died. The poem ends
with no spark of redemption: 'The great frame rotted/ While the past's slow
stream,/ Flowing through his head,/ Kept the rusty mill/ Of the mind turning
 / It was I it ground'.
Thomas deals with the condition of Wales in several of his poems in the same
spirit of ruthless candour. He is a passionately committed nationalist
appalled by much that he sees going on around him. He was 30 before he
learnt to speak Welsh but he wishes that he and the other Welsh poets I
mention had written in their own indigenous language.
He deeply resents, as he says in his outspoken pamphlet Cymru or Wales?,
'the effects of an English life-style, English thought processes and the
English vocabulary . . . ' However, as I hope I have indicated, this
resentment has not prevented Thomas in his poetry from attaining to a great
mastery over the English language.

As the students hiked up into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, 
they stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind the rest of the group, pulled a 
journal from pocket or backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student 
wrote a mini-essay about life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. 
Another noted that the mountain trail was "as wide as a sparerib." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 students were taking an unusual interdisciplinary course being offered 
for the first time this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About 
Nature," the double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and 
a beginning composition course. Co-taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim 
Krusoe, it requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and 
a simile. Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion is and why Los Angeles has this smog-trapping weather condition, they 
are also studying nature writing and learning how to string together their own 
words about the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they have to learn to write in six weeks," Krusoe said. "It's a 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book, "Country Year," is especially useful 
to beginning nature writers. Hubbell is "an immaculate writer," he said, and 
her book, best known for its section on bees, is "about someone staying at 
home, paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that look like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Flourishes 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said that students tend to "get too pretty" when they first begin to 
write about storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the 
course are examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The 
assigned writers have "natural voices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes those voices are downright peevish. Among the handouts for the class 
is one of Krusoe's own poems, titled "Nature," which includes the 
non-reverential lines: "Well why shouldn't he hate nature? / What's it ever 
done for him? Or me for that matter?" The poet said most of his work has an 
"urban feel." Krusoe said he wanted to teach the course with Selby in order to 
learn more about physical Southern California and "to learn how to write nature 
poetry that would interest me." 
</P>
<P>
As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials -- 
mostly sandstone and conglomerates -- that formed the outcropping and the 
natural forces that created it and continue to shape it. Geology lessons are 
much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom, he noted. "You can't stand 
here and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Purposes 
</P>
<P>
Student Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale. As a result of the 
course, she said, she can think about things that she never even noticed 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Batiste has also become a seasoned hiker. On the first couple of outings, she 
was startled by every dive-bombing dragonfly. "I've really gotten better," she 
said, undaunted by the slither of a lizard in the dry grass. 
</P>
<P>
After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read 
their journal entries aloud. Frank Kianfar, a 23-year-old business major, 
began: "The live oak trees drop their leaves, and they are dead even before 
they hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe had good things to say about all of the students' brief essays. Like a 
conscientious parent, he tries to teach his charges without battering their 
self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet said, "I feel my compliments are 
as creative as anything I've ever done."

FT  26 MAR 92 / Arts: Hindle and Balanchine - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to be nurtured by Peter Wright
with the Birmingham Royal Ballet. His Sacred Symphony for the company last
May was a professional debut; now, with funding received by Peter Wright
(the 1991 Digital Premier Award), his second creation has been made
possible. Dark Horizons is set to Shostakovich's chamber symphony (the
eighth string quartet in Barshai's arrangement). Its theme is the fate of
North American Indians driven from their lands 'on to infertile
reservations', and it is cast with nine male dancers placed against a rocky
landscape designed by Peter Farley.
It is all - in the current cant phrase - 'politically correct' (even the
Shostakovich score bore a dedication to 'victims of fascism and war'), and
staggeringly worthy in ideals. In a threnody for a people dispossessed,
Hindle shows us the men (outfitted in what look like Iriquois bathing
trunks, body paint and modish hair-styles) who are by turns watchful or
sorrowing. There is nothing, though, suggestive of the extreme richness of
tribal dance - central to the identity of the Indian races, and, in the
Sioux ghost dance cult at the turn of this century, a war-like response to
persecution by the white man. Instead, Hindle gives us pieties with an
admixture of conventional academic movement and poses that look more
cinematic than ethnic.
The merits of the piece lie in Hindle's ability to make fluent lines of
movement, and to set a personal stamp upon the dynamics of a phrase. That he
is gifted there is no doubt, and he has inspired heart-whole performances
from his cast, admirably led by Joseph Cipolla. Yet, as with Sacred
Symphony, I find that Hindle has opted for a theme too static to allow the
emotional or physical development which will let his creativity soar and
dare braver things.
This new BRB triple bill opened with a sympathetic account of Les Sylphides.
Not grand, but sincere; musical (Philip Ellis, here as with the
Shostakovich, guiding sure accounts of the score) and graceful in manner,
and in Ravenna Tucker finding a sensitive ballerina for the mazurka and the
nocturne duet: gentle, lovely dancing. The programme ended with Hans van
Manen's Five Tangos, a work without which I can very well do.
Sir Kenneth MacMillan's new and stunning Judas Tree is framed in the Opera
House programme by two major Balanchine pieces: Stravinsky Violin Concerto
and Symphony in C. The evening is one which, with the addition of Brian
Elias' powerful score for MacMillan, reasserts the musical standards of our
national ballet and the responsiveness of our dancers to good scores and
fine accompaniment.
The influence of Constant Lambert upon the identity of the Royal Ballet can
never be over-estimated: as composer, conductor, arbiter of taste for two
decades from the inception of the company, his imprint still lies in the
civilised musical attitudes of our dancers and choreographers, even in
certain felicities of style. Balanchine, most musical and most musically
educated of choreographers, never put a dancer's foot wrong in relationship
with a note or phrase. And though the Royal Ballet manner does not aim for
the bright-edged clarity of New York City Ballet in works such as Violin
concerto or Symphony in C, there is energy and rigour to the dancing in this
current series of performances, and the sense of a company on fine and
secure form.
Part of this is owed to the vitality of the orchestral playing under Barry
Wordsworth. Stravinsky Violin Concerto on two recent evenings sounded
spirited and intense (and intensely poetic in the arias), with the young
Israeli violinist Hagai Shaham a dazzling soloist, and the dancers'
performance reflected these qualities exactly. Darcey Bussell exposed all
the linear tension of the first aria; Sylvie Guillem, looking at moments
like Sargent's portrait of Mme Gautreau, seemed to lose herself in the dance
to potent effect. In the sunburst of Symphony in C , the refinement of the
orchestral playing - textures airy, clear  - encouraged dancing that was
buoyant, generous, and radiant in spirit as in step.
About The Judas Tree I can but say that a second viewing revealed fresh
layers of meaning and fresh richness of choreographic invention (how vivid
is Mark Silver, seemingly the one sympathetic character, standing hand over
mouth, denying the truth, Peter-fashion, at the action's crisis). The detail
and power in the company performances is everywhere magnificent. It is an
astonishing, adventurous work of art. Brian Elias' score is superbly
theatrical, and it finds ideal advocates in the Opera House orchestra under
Wordsworth.

FT  16 APR 93 / Reading list that turns new leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARK Twain and Ray Bradbury rub shoulders with Charlotte Bronte and Susan
Hill, and Dickens and Shakespeare jostle with Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Henrik Ibsen in the National Curriculum Council's suggested English
literature reading list for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. Even Philip
Larkin gets a mention.
One immediate effect of the list will be to boost sales for writers not yet
widely read in schools, according to Penguin, the publishers owned by the
Pearson Group, which also owns the Financial Times.
Mr Patrick Hutchinson, Penguin's marketing and sales director, described the
list as mainly 'safe and traditional'. But he added that inclusion on the
list would help sales of some of the lesser-known modern authors.
He said: 'When the list for primary schools came out three years ago, many
schools didn't have the resources to buy all the books. Parents then rushed
out to the shops and bought copies for the children, so this is going to
propel authors on to shelves where they may not have been before.'
Appearances on reading lists reliably increase book sales.
The proposals prescribe that children between 11 and 14 (Key Stage Three)
should read at least one Shakespeare play, then read another between 14 and
16 (Key Stage Four). These must come from separate categories - the
histories, tragedies and comedies.
Beyond this, 11-to-14-year-olds should read drama 'appropriate for their
age' - one suggestion is Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood - while
14-to-16-year-olds have to read at least one play by an author from a list
that includes Arthur Miller, J B Priestley, Oscar Wilde, Robert Bolt, Tom
Stoppard, Alan Bennett and Henrik Ibsen.
Requirements for poetry include more imaginative choices. At both key
stages, children must read works by at least five poets, of whom at least
two should have been published before 1900.
The list at Key Stage Four includes a number of writers less well-exposed.
In addition to Blake, Coleridge, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, Donne
and Chaucer, modern poets such as Brian Patten, Derek Walcott, Sylvia Plath,
Dannie Abse and Norman MacCaig are included.
Modern writers who might hope for a boost from sales include Jan Mark,
Rukshana Smith, Michelle Magorian, Beverly Naidoo, Anne Holm, Berlie
Doherty, Joan Lingard, Katherine Paterson, Rosa Guy, Marjorie Darke and Gwyn
Thomas.
Teachers reacted with alarm to the amount of Shakespeare prescribed,
regardless of childrens' ability. Ms Judith Rowley, an English teacher from
the Morton School in Carlisle, said: 'I'm certainly not against Shakespeare,
and I would expect to read one of his plays with a top set by the age of 12
or 13, but as far as the lower groups are concerned I would be doubtful
about it.'
She also voiced concern about the inclusion of Ibsen and Solzhenitsyn.

   Assuming Johnny can read, the question remains:
What should he read?
   The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph have tried to answer
the question with lists of classics recommended for children from 3
to 18. Apart from a few books, notably J.D. Salinger's ``The
Catcher in the Rye'' and the basic works for children, the lists
had little in common.
   The papers revealed a powerful pro-British bias, with David
Holloway, one of the conservative Telegraph's panel of experts,
commenting: ``American universities tend to supply their students
with reading lists containing thousands of titles. This is not only
daunting but counterproductive.''
   So The Telegraph suggested the 100 books every youngster who has
gone to school ought to have read by the time he or she finishes.
The Times' panel of teachers, writers and critics came up with 50
titles.
   The Times went by age group and stuck to fiction, while The
Telegraph cast a wider net: modern fiction, classics, translations,
poetry, drama and entertainment.
   The two papers found the most agreement on books for young
children, with The Times recommending, among others, the ``Winnie
the Pooh'' stories, Rudyard Kipling's ``Just So Stories,''
``Charlotte's Web'' by E.B. White and Maurice Sendak's ``Where the
Wild Things Are.''
   The Telegraph, altogether weightier in its approach, opened with
a category called cornerstones that included the Bible, Homer's
``Iliad,'' Horace's ``Odes,'' Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales'' and all of Shakespeare's plays.
   ``Don Quixote,'' by Miguel de Cervantes, John Milton's
``Paradise Lost,'' Boswell's ``The Life of Samuel Johnson and
Charles Darwin's ``The Origin of Species'' rounded out the list.
   However, against such high-brow fare as Bertrand Russell's
``History of Western Philosophy,'' the Telegraph also suggested an
entertainment list that ranged from Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar
Allan Poe to ``The Big Sleep'' by Raymond Chandler and Agatha
Christie's ``The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.''
   Its children's category included one American work, Mark Twain's
``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Many of the others in the
category were the same as chosen by The Times.
   In its 12-18 category The Times ignored Shakespeare and the
ancients but suggested Twain's ``Huckleberry Finn,'' George
Orwell's ``1984,'' ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ``Jane Eyre'' by
Charlotte Bronte and ``Pride and Prejudice'' by Jane Austen.
   There was Robert Louis Stevenson's ``Treasure Island'' alongside
``The Lord of the Flies,'' William Golding's frightening tale of
power-corrupted children. Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye'' rubbed
shoulders with ``Emil and the Detectives'' by Erich Kastner.
   The Telegraph recommended 13 translations, among them Boris
Pasternak's ``Dr. Zhivago,'' Gustave Flaubert's ``Madame Bovary,''
``The Three Musketeers'' by Alexandre Dumas, ``The Plague'' by
Albert Camus, Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis'' and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
   ``War and Peace'' didn't make the list but ``Anna Karenina'' did.
   The Telegraph's longer list found more room for American works,
mentioning F. Scott FitzGerald's ``The Great Gatsby,'' Margaret
Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' Ernest Hemingway's ``A Farewell
to Arms,'' John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and Saul
Bellow's ``The Adventures of Augie March.''
   Vladimir Nabokov's erotic masterpiece ``Lolita'' also was
recommended.
   Poets on the Telegraph list included John Keats, William
Wordsworth, Samuel T. Coleridge, Lord Byron, Alfred Tennyson, T.S.
Eliot, W.H. Auden, Philip Larkin and Charles Baudelaire, plus ``The
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.''
   Its recommended plays were Moliere's ``Tartuffe,'' William
Congreve's ``Love for Love,'' Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ``The
School for Scandal,'' Oscar Wilde's ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master Builder,'' Anton Chekhov's
``The Cherry Orchard,'' George Bernard Shaw's ``Saint Joan'' and
Samuel Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot.''
   But as the Telegraph's Holloway acknowledged in his
introduction: ``It would be an ideal child who had read the lot,
and a pretty remarkable one who could score more than 50 percent.
Certainly, none ... could, hand on heart, say that he or she had
read the whole list before leaving school.''

TRAIL-HIKING STUDENTS TRACK THE SECRETS OF NATURE -- AND OF HOW TO WRITE ABOUT

</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials that 
formed the outcropping and the natural forces that created it. Geology lessons 
are much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom. "You can't stand here 
and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," Selby said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale. 
</P>
<P>
Batiste has also become a seasoned hiker. On the first couple of outings, she 
was startled by every dive-bombing dragonfly. "I've really gotten better," she 
said, undaunted by the slither of a lizard in the dry grass. 
</P>
<P>
After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read 
their journal entries aloud. Like a conscientious parent, he tries to teach his 
charges without battering their self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet 
said, "I feel my compliments are as creative as anything I've ever done."

PERESTROIKA 
</P>
<P>
New Thinking for Our Country and the World by Mikhail Gorbachev (A Cornelia and 
Michael Bessie Book / Harper &amp; Row: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev's remarkable manifesto "Perestroika" (or restructuring) 
criticizes the "hard legacy of stagnation" of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Parallel with the democratization of society, radical economic reform is the 
groundwork of our entire perestroika," reads the Resolution of the 19th 
All-Union Conference of the CPSU included in this new edition. "New democratic 
methods of leadership, openness and glasnost find it hard to make their way, 
coming up against conservatism, inertia and dogmatism in thinking and society." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, "there can be no revolutionary restructuring without invigorating 
in every way the intellectual and cultural potential of society." 
</P>
<P>
One of the dictums in this edition's "On Combating Bureaucracy" takes 
independent thinking to new limits: "Satire, as a weapon against . . . 
manifestations of bureaucratic attitudes, . . . should be used to full 
measure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War Era by James M. McPherson (Ballantine Books: $14.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing directly from the official records of the Union and Confederate armies 
as well as the diaries of leaders and soldiers published more than a century 
ago, James M. McPherson vividly recaptures a soldier's thoughts during the 
Civil War as well as extensively delineating the war's numerous "dynamic 
transformations." 
</P>
<P>
"We heard all through the war that the army 'was eager to be led against the 
enemy,' " a Union soldier wrote about the fighting at Antietam. "The truth is, 
when bullets are whacking against tree-trunks and solid shots are cracking 
skulls like egg-shells, the consuming passion . . . of the average man is to 
get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Most compelling is McPherson's well-supported thesis that "at numerous critical 
points during the war things might have gone altogether differently." Even as 
late as 1864, the North came to the brink of peace negotiations -- that is, 
until the capture of Atlanta and the destruction of the South's army in the 
Shenandoah Valley "clinched matters for the North." 
</P>

<P>
THE IMMORTAL BARTFUSS 
</P>
<P>
by Aharon Appelfeld; translated from the Hebrew by Jeffrey M. Green (Perennial 
Library / Harper &amp; Row: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
 A Holocaust survivor and now a moneylender in Jaffa, Bartfuss has little 
patience for words or conversation; he avoids or ignores old acquaintances, and 
is unable to sleep. He even hates his own wife, a fellow survivor of the death 
camps, for her voluble reaffirmation of life. 
</P>
<P>
But his solitary life is shaken when real illness strikes him. 
</P>
<P>
Only then does Bartfuss begin to show some emotion: He apologizes to a man whom 
he had beaten physically; he genuinely mourns the death of a lover. But his 
sexuality takes an unhealthy turn when he grows attracted to his own retarded 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Aharon Appelfeld writes sparingly, obliquely in this brief novel, justly 
rendering the shell of a damaged man who regains in the end some semblance of 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAYER AND THALBERG 
</P>
<P>
The Make-Believe Saints by Samuel Marx (Samuel French: $12.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Introductions like Samuel Marx's into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios generally 
only happen on the movie screen. Marx accidentally ran into Irving Thalberg, 
whom he had known at Universal Pictures, on 54th Street in New York. Thalberg 
was now production head of MGM and said in passing, "Why don't you try screen 
writing? . . . Come to the coast." A few months later Marx did just that. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd shown up yesterday, I'd have given you an assignment and forgotten 
about you. If you'd arrived tomorrow, the position would have been filled," 
Thalberg tells Marx when the studio guard finally lets him through. The story 
editor at MGM had just resigned and Marx was to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
Marx was story editor from 1930 to 1936, then a producer, working for MGM on 
and off for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of Louis B. Mayer, Marx writes: "The truth about Mayer doesn't come easily. 
Without doubt he was violent when roused, ruthless when crossed, a battler 
often without pity. . . . But he had another dimension." Marx's treatment of 
Thalberg, a younger man with whose death at 36 the book concludes, is equally 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
As Wayne Warga wrote in his review for The Times in 1975, "Marx substitutes 
reportage for veneration and he gets right to the point. That he also is candid 
is simply an added benefit of this carefully written history." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHATTERTON 
</P>
<P>
by Peter Ackroyd (Ballantine Books: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
The brief, tragic life of Thomas Chatterton was the inspiration for works by 
such Romantic poets as Keats and Wordsworth. Best known for a literary hoax 
(Chatterton counterfeited a series of poems by an imaginary 15th-Century monk), 
Chatterton's own writings never found a publisher, and at 18 he killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton and his forgery haunt Peter Ackroyd's novel as well. The opening 
section is set in contemporary London, where Charles Wychwood discovers that 
Chatterton had forged his own death and in fact lived on to write the poems 
attributed to William Blake and others. Another portion of the book tells of a 
different kind of forgery, as George Wallis paints "The Death of Chatterton" 
using the poet George Meredith as his model. 
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of Ackroyd's novel is a deeply serious concern with art, its 
relationship to the artist and to 'reality,' " Paul D. Sheats wrote in these 
pages.

correct quote in 22nd graf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can tell the old, retired, slightly rundown
gumshoe is back on the job. He offers his younger brother, an
ex-cop, a pint of Levy's Select Irish Whiskey to help out. ``House
brand,'' he explains.
   So it goes for Robert Mitchum in ``Jake Spanner, Private Eye.''
But his new movie, airing Nov. 15 on the USA Network, is not the
``Farewell My Lovely'' or ``The Big Sleep'' kind of classic Mitchum
detective movie.
   ``This is a complete charade,'' Mitchum says of this cable
venture, which co-stars his brother, John, as the ex-cop; a son,
Jim, as a cop, and Ernest Borgnine as retired mobster Sal ``The
Salami'' Piccolo.
   The film, he reports, includes one scene ``with a bunch of naked
girls around the pool. I think it's all done very discreetly.''
   Students of the cinema may consider ``Spanner'' close in spoof
spirit to Mitchum's ``His Kind of Woman.'' That 1951 epic makes one
suspect that, during filming, the cast partook of strong drink and
had fun.
   ``I don't remember what it was all about,'' Mitchum insists. He
does recall the fun part. And that producer Howard Hughes made the
cast film it twice, the idea being to make a good film a great one.
That was no fun, he says.
   Mitchum, whose more recent work includes the two ABC
mega-miniseries, ``War and Remembrance'' and ``Winds of War,'' has
a dry, sardonic sense of humor befitting a star who has logged 46
years in movies and TV movies.
   Now 72, he has been around and about. His early days dossier
includes ditch-digging; a shot at boxing; assistant to the
astrologer Carroll Righter; the Long Beach Theatre Guild, and
writing for radio.
   That should prepare a man for anything, particularly writing
scripts where the producers, he recalls, ``would say `we need 17
pages by Wednesday,' and they wouldn't say 17 pages of what.''
   He laughs when asked if he ever feels he could write a better
script than many offered him. ``Well, I've just shown the attitude
that Johnny Huston had. He said, `If they want 'em bad, kid, we can
make 'em bad, too.'''
   Fortuneatly, his first substantial role, one that got him an
Oscar nomination in 1945, was in a good movie. He played the
war-weary infantry captain in ``The Story of G.I. Joe,'' a film
based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning column by war correspondent Ernie
Pyle.
   His first insubstantial roles were in 1943, in ``Hopalong
Cassidy'' movies. He had no trepidations about becoming an actor
then, he says, only about getting his horse to go forward and to
stop:
   ``I didn't know how to ride a horse, really. As a matter of
fact, I didn't know if you were supposed to bring your own horse.''
   Mitchum's plain, sleepy-eyed, unpretentious style often has won
acclaim, that usually occurring when he likes the movie he's in.
   Away from the cameras, he avoids the Hollywood ramble. He is a
private man. He packs a tight suitcase, odd but nice in an era when
it takes a two-by-four to stop a star from talking about his or her
personal life.
   It is known, however, that Mitchum has played guitar and likes
jazz guitarists such as Barney Kessel. But he quit as a player a
long time ago, he says: ``There are too many good ones.''
   He also has written poetry. But again, that's history, he
insists: ``No. I never see anything but the back of a check to sign
now.''
   Still, he likes ``all the coherent poets,'' particularly William
Wordsworth, the English romantic. This sparks a memory of a time a
Wordworth passage even showed up in a film he made with Katharine
Hepburn.
   Doing a fine basso version of her distinctive speech pattern,
Mitchum recalls that, reading the script, she ``comes up and says
`The world is too much with us late ends soon,''' and then demands,
``Who said that?''
   ``I said, `Nobody ever said that.' She said, `What?' I said,
`What the hell's it mean?'''
   They repaired to the studio's library to check the line and its
punctuation, Mitchum recalls. Then, the actor with a rep for
playing tough guys proceeds to surprise his listener by quoting
part of the passage from memory:
   ``The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and
spending, we lay waste our powers ...''

   Elsewhere in television:
   SWEEPS ARE HERE AND SO IS SEX _ This is a month of ratings
``sweeps,'' and surprise, this week is ``Bad Girls Week'' on
Geraldo Rivera's syndicated talk show. Monday's show concerned
mothers in prison, Tuesday it was women in jail for life, and today
you get teen-age prostitutes. Thursday will bring on women who date
married men, while Friday's guests are ... nymphomaniacs.
   What is Phil Donahue doing in the way of counterbattery fire?
He's being relatively restrained, with all but the New York market
getting a show Monday on food's effect on sexual performance. The
poor New Yorkers.
   They got a show that previously aired elsewhere in America, a
``Donahue'' spokeswoman says. It was about transsexuals,
transvestites and hermaphrodites.
   ``Donahue,'' orginating from Los Angeles this week, has the men
of NBC's ``L.A. Law'' on tap today.

@  Genius Envy: A Byronic Kiss-and-Tell
@  ----
@  By Julie Salamon </HL>
<DD> 08/21/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   The Romantic poet Lord Byron was born with a crippled foot and a great genius. 
Perhaps compensating for both, he led a multifarious sex life that resulted in repeated bouts with venereal disease. 
In 1816 his publisher, John Murray, recognizing that Lord Byron had become almost as famous for his sexual exploits as for his poetry, thought of a way to capitalize further on his celebrity author. 
Mr. Murray hired John Polidori, a young doctor, to tend to the poet's ailments during his travels -- and to take notes for purposes of a kiss-and-tell biography. 

   Polidori did not end up ghosting the 19th-century equivalent of "The Andy Warhol Diaries." 
His sister cut out the naughty parts. 
Now, however, the novelist and scholar Paul West, imagining what must have been deleted (and possibly more), has come up with the diary that would have put Polidori on the best-seller list of his day. 

   Writing as though he were Polidori (the way Polidori wished he could write), Mr. West has turned in a slyly learned and bawdily obsessive account of one man's fatal attraction for another: "Lord Byron's Doctor" (Doubleday, 277 pages, $19.95). 
Though Polidori had his own talents -- at 20 he was the youngest medical graduate of the University of Edinburgh -- he was a Byronic wannabe. 
He wanted to be lusted after by women and men, to be passionate yet coolly sophisticated and, above all, to be a Famous Writer palling around with other famous writers. 

   Mr. West has a remarkable gift for mimickry; in a previous novel, "The Place in Flowers Where Pollen Rests," he convincingly assumed the voices of Hopi Indians. 
Here he's switched to something altogether different. 
His Polidori speaks with the voice of an entirely believable educated Scotsman living in the early 19th century. 
Not that his Polidori would feel out of place in the late 20th century. 
This young striver would have been thrilled to see his face on the cover of People, had it existed in 1816. 
He's infected with a desire to be somebody else -- anything but a doctor in an age when the leech, not aspirin, was the common remedy of choice. 

   Lord Byron's talent eventually becomes an irritant to Mr. West's Polidori, who is disgusted that so valuable a gift was distributed to a vulgarian, a man whose way of "priming" a chambermaid for sex was to smack her hard in the belly. 
The mewling Polidori is certain that he feels Byronic rages and sorrows, but he is mute and frustrated. 
"I stood there, getting exercised, all for naught," writes West's Polidori. 
"Milord would have spewed forth a poem about it had he been there. 
Out they always came, like a snake's questing tongue. 
Each poem seemed ready-made, and I suspected that he had within him poems stored like baker's loaves. . . ." 


   Mr. West, who has written 11 novels and nine works of nonfiction -- including a study of Byron -- plays his scholarly interest in the Romantic writers and their Gothic literature against his extravagantly mischievous imagination. 
So his Polidori can write just as vividly and acutely about the makings of a Gothic story or the absurdities of 19th-century medicine as he does about Lord Byron's genitalia -- which are a source of endless fascination for the young doctor, who claims to be repulsed by the subject even as he dwells on it with giddy erudition. 

   Ever-complaining and always jealous, Polidori describes himself as a "serf," as "a moon to {Byron's} planet," and trails the poet across Europe to the Villa Diodati, the mansion Byron rented outside Geneva. 
Mr. West clearly is fascinated by the now-legendary time Byron spent at the Villa Diodati with Percy Shelley and his mistress, Mary Godwin, and her half-sister, Claire Clairmont, another Byron groupie (who became pregnant by him). 
Almost half the book is spent there, amid the literary and sexual hijinks that many people have speculated inspired Mary Shelley to write "Frankenstein" the following year. (Mr. 
West isn't the first to be lured by the goings-on at the Villa Diodati. 
Ken Russell's lurid 1984 film "Gothic" was inspired by Villa Diodati and its colorful assortment of hypersexed guests.) 

   Polidori circles around Byron's clique wearing the sneer of the outcast. 
He refers to Shelley as "the Shelley person." 
He has sex with the pregnant Claire after it's become plain that Byron has wearied of them both. 
One starts to sympathize with Byron. 
Even amusing snivelers like Polidori soon wear out their welcome. 

   Mr. West's maneuvering of Polidori's jealousy brings to mind playwright Peter Shaffer's portrait of the Hapsburg court composer Salieri in "Amadeus." 
Mr. Shaffer portrayed Salieri as a competent musician who composed by the book only to be upstaged by a foul-mouthed, "unworthy" prankster named Mozart. 
But unlike Mr. Shaffer, Mr. West doesn't show the slightest bit of sympathy for Polidori's ludicrous envy. 
He simply allows Polidori to debunk the idea that great artists are necessarily great men or women. 
His Byron is a hypochondriac, a sadomasochist, a cold-hearted manipulator who infuriates the tremulous Polidori but gives Mr. West the pleasure of playing with great material -- a pleasure he generously passes along in this always original and entertaining novel.

THE SCIENCE OF WRITING; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS PULL DOUBLE DUTY IN THE WILDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the students hiked up into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, 
they stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind the rest of the group, pulled a 
journal from pocket or backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student 
wrote a mini-essay about life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. 
Another noted that the mountain trail was "as wide as a spare rib." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 students were taking an unusual interdisciplinary course being offered 
for the first time this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About 
Nature," the double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and 
a beginning composition course. Co-taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim 
Krusoe, it requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and 
a simile. Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six-Week Course 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion layer is and why Los Angeles has this smog-trapping weather 
condition, they are also studying nature writing and learning how to string 
together their own words about the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book "Country Year" is especially useful to 
beginning nature writers. Hubbell is "an immaculate writer," he said, and her 
book, best known for its section on bees, is "about someone staying at home, 
paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that look like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Flourishes 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said students tend to "get too pretty" when they first begin to write 
about storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the course 
are examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The writers 
have "natural voices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials -- 
mostly sandstone and conglomerates -- that formed the outcropping and the 
natural forces that created it and continue to shape it. Geology lessons are 
much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom, he noted. "You can't stand 
here and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Purposes 
</P>
<P>
Student Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale. As a result of the 
course, she said, she can think about things that she never even noticed 
before. 
</P>
<P>
After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read 
their journal entries aloud. Frank Kianfar, a 23-year-old business major, 
began: "The live oak trees drop their leaves, and they are dead even before 
they hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe had good things to say about all of the students' brief essays. Like a 
conscientious parent, he tries to teach his charges without battering their 
self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet said, "I feel my compliments are 
as creative as anything I've ever done."

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Literary feast in Cheltenham - Criticism, therapy,
crime, BA Young experiences it all at this year's festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's Festival, which has just completed its first week, is immensely
successful.
The opening day included a memorial reading for Alan Hancox, the Cheltenham
bookseller who has long been the Festival's patron saint and occasional
director - perhaps mainly of local interest, but the readings were by Ted
Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Michael Foot and Melvyn Bragg, no modest assembly.
Then a debate, about war correspondents' capacity to give the whole truth,
between America's Martha Gellhorn, the BBC's John Simpson, and Max Hastings,
Editor of The Daily Telegraph, which currently sponsors the Festival. The
day's rousing conclusion was Anthony Burgess's Cheltenham Lecture, on
translation; his versions of Roman dialect verses included four-letter words
seldom heard in that hall.
Is there any special theme? a visitor asked me. Half-a-dozen at least, from
which you might choose biography, travel, therapy or crime before reaching
mere literary criticism or plain old poetry (for which poets have an hour
every day).
Therapy may seem unexpected, but we had an interesting analysis of Salman
Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Kleinian analyst Hanna Segal.
Wordsworth's Prelude was psych-ed by Dr Ronald Britton, and George Eliot's
Middlemarch by AS Byatt and Ignes Sodre. For the opposition, Against Therapy
was a superbly witty attack on therapists by Fay Weldon, in which she read
some of her next novel. Travel was sensibly discussed together by Redmond
O'Hanlon, Colin Thubron and Gillian Tindall, and less seriously by humorist
Miles Kington, who travels with a double-bass.
Crime fielded a strong side. PD James asked How Good are Crime Novels? - is
crime trivialised? can the writer get properly into the criminal mind? As
Lady James has entered another field in her newest novel, perhaps she felt
too many literary handcuffs. In Serious Crime, three days later, Ruth
Rendell, Julian Symons and HRF Keating paced the same field with their own
individual tread; and next morning, Patrick Marnham discussed Simenon, whose
biography he published this year. John Mortimer affectionately offered a
parade of both fictional and real villains.
Biography was well represented too. The practice of the art was luminously
examined by Hilary Spurling in her account of her researches into Ivy
Compton-Burnett's family, and into Paul Scott's undeclared years. Richard
Hoggart dealt with the craft of autobiography, having written three. Among
the biographers, Richard Holmes was enlightening on the circumstances of
Shelley's death; Humphrey Carpenter on Benjamin Britten's life. Three
left-wing ex-Ministers, Tony Benn, Barbara Castle and Roy Jenkins,
approached the question of political memoirs' truth mainly through their own
writing.
Today's theatre was sharply dealt with by critic Michael Billington. London
theatre was sacrificed to musicals, while the two great subsidised
companies, the Royal National and the Royal Shakespeare, were doing work the
world might envy. There were many good young writers, but much of the
interesting theatre was in the regions. The previous evening, Billington had
been straight man to John Schlesinger's talk on directing films. It was
characteristic of the care with which this year's programme was organised
that the local Odeon gave showings of the films he spoke of.
Nigel Nicolson was authoritative on Vita and Harold; Richard Ingrams devoted
on Chesterton; John Julius Norwich and Artemis Cooper assured on the letters
between Evelyn Waugh and Lady Diana Cooper. The annual Shakespeare Lecture
was given by John Bayley on Shakespeare's Enemies, the commentators who
impose false emphases or meanings on the plays; and the Cheltenham Lecture
by Peter Ackroyd, in a marvellous hour on Englishness and the English
Language. He traced a specific character in English from Philip Sidney to
the middle of the 19th century, the equivalent of Hogarth's 'line of beauty'
 -now no more.
This is no exhaustive view of what we have heard so far in the Festival,
superbly directed by Richard Cohen. There was a children's drama festival
too, four newly-commissioned plays, that alas I had no time for. More when
the Festival is done.

<HEAD>U.S. Peacekeeping Force Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of Liberia and other
prominent Liberians say their president will soon resign and leave
the country and asked for a temporary U.S. peacekeeping force in
the war torn nation.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the department received the appeal and may respond in some way
today.
   Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington Ambassador
Eugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other Liberians wrote
President Bush Thursday that they expect the ``resignation and
departure from Liberia'' of President Samuel Doe ``and the
establishment of an interim government.''
   The letter proposed that ``a limited U.S. force be provided, on
the invitation of that interim government, to play an initial
peacekeeping role'' in the vicinity of Monrovia, the capital now
under siege by rebel forces.
   The appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure of
Doe would be carried out. While agreeing not to seek re-election,
the president has refused to leave the country and is sitting out
the approach of rebel forces in his heavily fortified residence in
Monrovia.
   The State Department said the letter was being studied by its
task force monitoring the crisis in the African nation founded by
freed American slaves 150 years ago.
   The letter and its signatures were regarded as authentic, the
U.S. official said.
   U.S. warships with Marine units embarked were moved close to
Liberia several weeks ago.
   Ambassador Wordsworth-Stevenson and former Liberian U.N.
Ambassador Winston A. Tubman, listed as a press spokesman, did not
answer their telephones Thursday night.
   Without foreign peacekeepers, victory ``by any faction'' will
not end the civil war and ``is far more likely to trigger a more
violent ethnic-based bloodbath,'' the letter said.
   This is because the war has spawned ``rival armed factions now
threatening the capital, has inflamed tribal animosities and
endangered the whole country as never before,`` it said.
   ``Liberians are now at the mercy of advancing bands of
foreign-armed combatants, each with its own agenda and none capable
of averting massive plunder and tribal revenge,'' the letter added,
not naming the arms providers.
   Because of its moral authority in Liberia going back to the
country's founding, ``the United States is uniquely positioned,
with minimum risk, manpower and expense to halt the breakdown of
law and order in Liberia and prevent even worse carnage,'' the
letter said.
   ``Neighboring African states can thereafter play, as it is
intended they should, a more sustained peacekeeping role,'' it
added.
   ``This crucial help would not be viewed as colonial paternalism,
Mr. President,`` the appeal said. ``It would be welcomed by all
Liberians as the generous assistance of ...the same friend that
helped create Liberia nearly a century-and-a-half ago and has been
our constitutional ideal ever since.''
   Hopes for reform ``have turned to dust'' under Doe, who took
power in a 1980 coup, the letter said. The rebels accuse his
government of corruption, mismanagement and widespread abuse of
human rights.
   Other signers of the letter were Tubman, former armed forces
chief George Toe Washington, former Customs Commissioner George
Toukolon, former Post and Telecommunications Minister Abdulai
Vandi, former Commerce Minister A. Romeo Horton, Senator Hilary F.
Gbunblee, former Justice Minister Lawrence A. Morgan and Winifred
Massaqquoi, former student adviser at the Liberian Embassy in
Washington.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the
British poet who wrote ``The Ancient Mariner'' and ``Kubla Khan,''
was named the Whitbread Book of the Year on Wednesday.
   Author Richard Holmes was awarded the prize and $36,300 for his
biography ``Coleridge: Early Visions.''
   The volume is the first part of a major series on Coleridge, who
was an opium addict and contemporary of William Wordsworth.
   ``The prize means basically that I will have time to write
more,'' said the former teacher after receiving the award at
Whitbread's, a brewing firm.
   Holmes's book was voted Biography of the Year by Whitbread
judges in October. Competitors for the Book of the Year were
October's winners in the categories of first novel, best novel,
poetry and children's novel.
   Last year's Book of the Year award went to ``The Comforts of
Madness,'' Paul Sayer's first novel about long-term psychiatric
hospital patients who cannot speak.

<TEXT>
   After four novels, polite reviews and paltry
sales, A.S. Byatt has emerged from the shadow of her younger, more
prolific sister, novelist Margaret Drabble.
   Byatt's fifth and latest novel, ``Possession,'' scooped up
Britain's and Ireland's top literary awards and the hefty hardback
sold strongly leading up to Christmas.
   But the 54-year-old author is taking fame and fortune in stride.
   ``I'm too old to get awfully changed, yet young enough to enjoy
it,'' Byatt said in an interview.
   She has, however, become more wary. When ``Possession'' began
collecting rave reviews, she welcomed journalists into her home.
But after a catty comment or two about her housekeeping appeared in
print, she insists on doing interviews by telephone.
   Some of the $39,200 from the British Booker Prize and the
$45,000 from the Irish Times-Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize
have been spent on a few good suits and a London taxicab account.
The remainder will build a swimming pool at the author's house in
southern France and maybe buy a couple of pairs of shoes.
   ``Possession,'' in the tradition of John Fowles' ``French
Lieutenant's Woman,'' intertwines past and present: A modern
romance grows as two literary scholars discover, through poetry and
fragments of letters, an unknown relationship between two Victorian
poets.
   In her previous novels, Byatt worked with material from her own
life.
   ``It was a sort of pleasure not writing realistically about
anything I had actually experienced or knew ... the 19th century I
had to invent,'' she said.
   Antonia Susan Byatt was born in 1936 into the puritannical
household of a Yorkshire judge, John Drabble. She went to a Quaker
school, then to Cambridge where she graduated with honors. She
earned a master's degree at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was very unhappy there. I ... wanted something different and
got more of the same. I thought America would be big and modern
with chrome on everything, moving at twice the speed. Instead I was
in a Victorian building and a Victorian library with not a man in
sight,'' she said.
   Byatt taught American and English literature, including
Victorian poetry, at University College in London until 1983, when
she quit to write full time.
   Thirty years years ago, she gave the name Antonia to her first
daughter, and began calling herself A.S. Byatt.
   ``When I had my first child I was in a fit of despair. I was 23
and I thought she had better have this good name (Antonia) and
carry it on - for I shall never write a book,'' Byatt said.
   She and her first husband, Ian Byatt, also had a son, who was
killed in an accident at age 11. She and her second husband,
investment adviser Peter Duffy, have two daughters.
   Byatt published her first novel in 1964, and three more
followed. She also wrote a critical study of William Wordsworth and
Samuel Taylor Coleridge and another on novelist Iris Murdoch, and
edited George Eliot's ``The Mill on the Floss.''
   But it wasn't until her daughters had grown and she had
foresaken academia that she wrote ``Possession,'' with its strong
plot line and sexual tension.
   ``I had a very puritanical background and was taught to think
very hard about what was valuable in life, and from that background
novels aren't very valuable at all,'' she said.
   ``It's difficult to try and put anything first if you have
children, and until recently I wasn't at all quite sure that I
could put it first.''
   The author said her American publishers, Random House, were
concerned that ``Possession,'' at 511 pages and more than 1,700
lines of Victorian poetry, would be too academic for a broad
audience.
   ``People have made too much out of the fact that I'm an
academic. ... I am an artist not a career academic, but because I
talk about things as one knows things, people assume I am trying to
impress.''
   That impulse showed in her fourth novel, ``Still Life,''
published in 1985, about a playwright who becomes absorbed in his
subject, the painter Vincent van Gogh.
   ``You couldn't do it without doing the research, so I read the
letters, just reading a biography doesn't do it,'' Byatt said. She
also went to Amsterdam to study his paintings.
   Van Gogh appealed to Byatt because of their mutual passion for
light. She suffers from ``seasonally adjusted depression'' and must
sit in front of a bright light during winter.
   ``He is a paradigm of myself. I am obsessed with the sun and in
the south I start going too fast. When I am slightly on the edge of
being mad I get terribly speeded up like him, I know what he feels
like,'' she said.
   After years of comparisons with her younger sister, Byatt shrugs
off the reports of antagonism between the two.
   ``We get on fine, we don't see each other much and we don't look
for the worst in each other,'' Byatt said. She lives in cozy Putney
in south London, while her sister settled in tony Hampstead to the
north.
   Critics lazily tended to compare the two sisters, Byatt said,
``when there are other writers more interesting to be compared to.
... I don't mind being compared to Iris Murdoch, I learned a lot
from her and I admire her.''

FT  20 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A classic strategy - The
publisher which revived Everyman's Library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOVE A pornographic magazine shop in London's Soho, one of the most
startling publishing stories of recent years has unfolded, to the surprise
of the publishing establishment.
Three men have spent little more than two years resurrecting the nearly
defunct Everyman series of hardback classics. In the process they have
created a substantial market in the US, introduced the newly-designed tomes
into almost every good bookshop in the uk and, from scratch, sold 750,000
volumes in spite of the worst retail conditions for 20 years.
In the first nine months of trading, David Campbell Publishers, new owners
of the Everyman's Library with its hard back rights to 1,200 titles, racked
up a turnover of Pounds 2.4m. It surprised itself by making a pre-tax
profit, one of Pounds 120,000. For the current year to July, the tiny
company is on course to make Pounds 500,000 pre-tax on sales of Pounds 3.9m.
'Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide' is scrolled into every one
of the 60m books published in Everyman's Library since production started in
1906. The problem was that the company lost its guide some time in the
1940s. In spite of owning rights to a vast range of works from translations
of Aristotle to Conrad and Dickens, the company fell into decline. During
the 1980s it changed hands twice, ending up in the Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson
stable and with a yearly turnover of only a few hundred thousand pounds.
'I had been tracking it for a long time,' says David Campbell, who was then
a senior manager at the Hachette publishing company in France. 'I could
never understand why there was no hardback series of the world's greatest
books in English. There is even one in Norwegian for goodness sake] Everyman
was a great brand name and brand names are very rare in publishing. It was
also a good business idea.'
That idea was to produce high quality hardbacks, cloth bound rather than
glued and with acid free paper that would not brown. 'I thought that if we
could produce such books for only a few pounds more than a paper back we'd
have a market.' The target was the gift trade and readers who wanted
affordable books in 'permanent' form.
Campbell spent three years trying to raise the cash. In 1990, the venture
capital arm of merchant bank Robert Fleming provided capital of more than
Pounds 1m to cover the (much lower cost) purchase price and working capital.
For this the bank obtained a quarter stake in the new company. The bulk of
the shareholding is held by Campbell, Mark Bicknell, a 38-year-old former
investment banker, and Alewyn Birch, a man with a long career in publishing.
Campbell and Bicknell, who run the company, together put in a little over
Pounds 100,000.
'That's enough to hurt but not to take the roof away,' says Bicknell.
After the purchase it took a year to get the business running. Some of this
time was taken signing up a printer - Bertelsmann of Germany which produces
all the new Everyman books (retailing at Pounds 7 to Pounds 16 and averaging
Pounds 10) - and Random House, the US publishers, which handles all
marketing and distribution.
'You can be well managed, inventive and quick on your feet but no matter how
clever you are you need firepower and small companies don't have firepower,'
says Campbell.
'We were very fortunate that the US deal provides up front cash flow,' says
Bicknell. 'That gave enormous comfort to our printers.' On each print run
the little company is paid in advance about one third of what it is
eventually due.
David Campbell Publishers operates with small overheads, paying Pounds
18,000 a year for a three storey office in Soho and employing just four full
time staff. Currency movements have made a large contribution to profits.
The rise of the D-mark against the pound has not been beneficial but the
strengthening of the dollar has generated a windfall.
'We bought the company when it was Dollars 1.60 to the Pounds 1,' says
Bicknell. 'It then went to Dollars 1.90 and is now down to just over Dollars
1.40. If it had stayed at Dollars 1.90 making a profit would have proved
very difficult. We are making a margin of 5 per cent and currency movements
could wipe that out. I spend an hour a day talking to foreign exchange
dealers.'
The company's success nevertheless reflects its publishing nous. Of the 128
titles so far printed, 40 were not in the Everyman stable.
'Of the 1,200 titles we could plunder a good quarter we would not want to
publish,' says Campbell. Not surprising perhaps when they include
obscurities such as F W Robertson's Sermons on Christian Doctrine or The
Channings by Mrs Henry Wood. Instead Cambell has been buying hardback
reprint rights to 20th-century authors outside the Everyman stable,
including Orwell and Hemingway.
The company has also launched a series of children's books. 'I thought there
was a market for proper reading books with nice illustrations.' Alice in
Wonderland in smart, heavy duty binding sells for Pounds 7. Treasure Island
comes with drawings by Mervyn Peake.
The company has relaunched and repackaged a publication called Your
Birthday, 80 pages of historical events and famous birthdays - now being
published by W H Smith. Everyman hopes the little books, retailing at Pounds
3, will prove a cash cow. The company has also acquired the English language
rights to a new travel series by a French publishing house, the books
containing up to 2,000 illustrations in seven colours.
One trend that has helped is a readership swing towards the classics. 'I
think one reason is that there are 125,000 new titles in the English
language every year and that is far too many. Booksellers are all clogged up
and the man on the Clapham omnibus doesn't know what to take.'
One consequence is what has been termed the classics wars. Other publishers
are churning out volumes at a rapid rate of knots though all of these, from
Penguin to World Classics and Oxford are in paperback. One publisher,
Wordsworth, sells its paperback classics for Pounds 1.
Some in the publishing industry who thought Campbell was mad to buy Everyman
think Campbell could catch a cold from these new low-cost books. He
dismisses the suggestion. 'We have no competition. Wordsworth will hurt
Penguin. The more razzamataz in the market for classics the better.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Celebrating Shelley - the times and the places
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND'S response to the bi-centenary of the birth of one of its greatest
poets has been various and disparate - so unlike the official brouhaha that
surrounded last year's Rimbaud centenary in France. There have been many
lectures and readings up and down the country, some accompanied by music.
Oxford's Bodleian Library has been hosting a Shelley bi-centenary
exhibition, which runs until August 8. West Sussex County Council declared
May 20 a Shelley Vegetarian School Meals Day in commemoration of the poet's
vegetarianism. The Council has also published a Shelley Trail Guide,
'pinpointing places of interest in Sussex linked with Shelley and his
family.' In April a permanent Shelley Room was opened at Horsham Museum. At
Eton, Shelley's old school, speeches were delivered in his honour on April
23.
The occasion that Shelley's shade is likely to have enjoyed the most was the
Byron Society's dinner in his honour in the House of Lords on March 20,
addressed by the Tory Peer Lord Blake; a more kindred spirit can scarcely be
imagined. And on the day of the bicentenary itself, August 4, the National
Portrait Gallery in London will host a tribute to the poet.
Overseas, in April an exhibition of Shelley manuscripts opened at the New
York Public Library under the title Shelley: Poet and Legislator, and that
continues into September. In May a three-day international conference of
Shelley scholars examined the poet's legacy at New York's City University
Graduate Center.
Celebrations in Rome (where the poet's ashes are buried), many organised by
the Keats-Shelley Memorial Association with support from the British Council
and Penguin Italia, have included a series of readings, lectures and films,
and these will continue throughout the year. In Lerici, the May Poetry
festival offered an evening boat trip in his memory - without, on this
occasion, significant loss of life.
All details of this year's Shelley celebrations world-wide can be obtained
(send an SAE) from the Keats-Shelley Memorial Association, Flat 1, 33
Aberdeen Road, London N5 2UG.
Publishers have also pulled out a few stops. The Hardy scholar Desmond
Hawkins published a biographical account of Shelley's First Love (Margaret
Harriet Grove) in May (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 14.99). Those fond of the
fictionalised saga might wish to dip into Wild Spirit - the Story of Percy
Bysshe Shelley (Hodder, Pounds 15.99); Robert Gittings and Jo Manton have
re-assessed the importance of Mary Shelley's step-sister, Claire Clairmont,
in Claire Clairmont and the Shelleys (Oxford, Pounds 20), and Judith
Chernaik's Mab's Daughters, a fictional re-creation of the diaries of the
women in the Shelley circle, is available in paperback (Pan Books, Pounds
5.99).

BETTER LIVING THROUGH ALCHEMY;

<P>
THE CHYMICAL WEDDING BY LINDSAY CLARKE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 536 PP.,

<TEXT>
<P>
The alchemist was the forerunner of the modern chemist, just as the astrologer 
was the forerunner of the modern astronomer. When one considers the growing 
influence of astrology in recent decades -- from its role in the '60s 
counterculture and subsequent infiltration of conventional chatter ("What's 
your sign?") to its dramatic elevation to high office in the person of the 
Reagan White House astrologer -- should it be so surprising to come across a 
novel that seriously advocates the idea of better living through alchemy? 
</P>
<P>
Looking backwards through the keen lenses of modern natural science, we 
visualize the medieval alchemist as a confused figure: a charlatan or true 
believer who tried to convert "baser" (i.e., less precious) metals into gold. 
We think of alchemy as a pseudo-science claiming to change the physical world 
through spiritual, or "magic," power. Orthodox Christian contemporaries of 
alchemists looked askance at this abuse of spiritual power for materialistic 
ends. Rationalists doubted the claims of alchemists; the pious half-believed 
and disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Chymical Wedding," the second novel of British writer Lindsay Clarke 
(and the winner of the Whitbread Award for best novel of the year), alchemy is 
presented as a spiritual process with spiritual goals -- or, rather, as a quest 
for the fusion of material and spiritual worlds, endowing matter with spirit 
and making the spiritual world as "real" as the physical one. Historically, 
this is not illegitimate, for alchemy, cabalism, Gnosticism, witchcraft and 
Neoplatonism can be viewed as distinct yet intermingling streams in the lore of 
the occult. 
</P>
<P>
The occult often is mystical, but not always. Ideas declared heretical by the 
early Christian orthodoxy (including some that we might now judge 
scientifically sound) were sometimes kept alive as part of "occult" -- 
literally, "hidden" -- tradition. Followers of the occult had a knack for being 
rationalistic when the surrounding religious orthodoxy demanded faith alone, 
but for looking irrational compared with the modern scientific method, whose 
eventual triumph dealt a second devastating blow to these arcane forms of 
learning. Yet, in times of stress, when we are prone to doubt ourselves and our 
orthodoxies, the appeal of the occult grows stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, needless to say, is not concerned with specific formulas to change lead 
into gold, but rather with the change of outlook that might replace the 
mentality that (in Wordsworth's phrase) "murder(s) to dissect" with a more 
holistic one. Alchemy in "The Chymical Wedding" represents a quasi-Romantic, 
vaguely Blakean marriage of opposites: dark and light, male and female, 
spiritual and physical. In keeping with the mythologizing tendencies of such an 
enterprise, Clarke assembles two sets of characters to play out a pair of 
parallel stories -- one unfolding in the 1980s, the other in the 1820s -- which 
manage to intersect in mysterious ways. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestively named Alex Darken is a young poet in retreat from a failed 
marriage. Taking refuge at his publisher's cottage in a small English village 
in Norfolk, Alex encounters Edward Nesbit, an irascible old poet whose early 
verses Alex once admired extravagantly, and a young American named Laura, who 
seems to be attached to him. Edward mocks and entices Alex by reading him his 
fortune from tarot cards. Soon, despite his continuing skepticism, Alex is 
drawn into Edward and Laura's obsession with alchemy and into their personal 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Edward and Laura have been researching the story of another old man and young 
woman -- in this case, a father and daughter -- Henry and Louisa Agnew, 
alchemical adepts who lived in the village back in the 1820s. The two 
narratives are interwoven. While Henry labors in vain on his lifelong project 
of a poem setting forth the mysteries of alchemy, his daughter Louisa is 
writing a prose prolegomenon to his work, which she calls "An Open Invitation 
to the Chymical Wedding." Precisely what became of her work is a mystery that 
the modern-day "researchers" are trying to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Edward and Laura are joined by Alex Darken, so Henry and Louisa become 
involved with a newcomer to their neighborhood, a troubled young clergyman, 
Edwin Frere (another deliberately suggestive name, meaning brother in French). 
Like Alex, Edwin has problems in his marriage. The relationship that flowers 
between the passionate yet inhibited clergyman and the wise and beautiful 
Louisa finds a parallel and a contrast in the one that develops between Alex 
and Laura. Indeed, in some ways, the latter-day relationship is a "working out" 
of the earlier one. 
</P>
<P>
For my taste, the 19th-Century story line is the stronger of the two, both 
because it is innately more dramatic and because it captures that 
quintessentially 19th-Century blend of evangelical piety and scarcely submerged 
erotic passion. It is a set-piece, but a well-polished, nicely mounted one. The 
modern subplot has the typical late 20th-Century mix of broken marriages, 
spontaneous love-making, and dread of nuclear war (attending a Campaign for 
Nuclear Disarmament meeting, Alex wonders if alchemy can help us out of the 
pass to which we've brought ourselves). But this mix is a little muddled and 
pallid. 
</P>
<P>
We sense we're in trouble early on when cantankerous old Edward warns Alex that 
"poetry is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
By the end, it seems that alchemy is not enough either -- or, as the novel 
disingenuously implies, that it's too much for flawed human beings to handle 
(in which case, it is no more of a "solution" than the science, philosophy, 
religion, politics or poetry it set out to replace). 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's lush storytelling leads us through a circular maze located somewhere 
between the realms of possible enchantment and passable entertainment. But by 
the time we've emerged from the foliage and looked back on the labyrinth, it 
already seems a little too stagy to take to heart.

<TEXT>
Thomas Chatterton was an extreme example of the phenomenon of doomed youth.
When he died, by his own hand in 1770 at the age of 17, the precocious
Bristolian was the author of a series of pseudo-medieval poems and a forged
correspondence involving a 15th century monk which was so convincing that it
kept the scholars quarrelling for years. According to Keats, who dedicated
Endymion to him, he was 'the purest writer in the English language'. To
Wordsworth, he was 'The marvellous boy/ The sleepless soul that perished in
his pride.'
Hence the title of this show, which paints Chatterton as not marvellous at
all but a tittering, capricious whelp, not unlike Peter Shaffer's portrayal
of that other prodigy, Mozart, in Amadeus, but without the scatology.
To a certain extent Public Parts have a point. The conception of Chatterton
today is dominated by the Henry Wallis painting of 1856, which shows a
Byronic youth trailing decorously over the edge of his deathbed. The fact
that his death, by poisoning, would certainly not have been decorous
presents an intriguing counterpoint to his enshrinement in the romantic
imagination.
In their attempt to get to grips with Chatterton, this Bristol-based company
confronts his family after his death - his widowed mother, his passionate
and embittered sister and, most bizarrely, his paternal grandmother (played
by a man), whose senile delusions are seen as tracking into the precocious
fantasies of her two grandchildren.
This then is a play about the power politics of the imagination. The thesis
is that the fictitious Thomas Rowley was the creation of the childhood games
of Thomas and his sister Mary. He, being a boy, was sent to charity school;
she, being a girl, was not, so it was he who acquired the skills to make
something of the fiction.
Rowley is represented as a spirit invoked by the two children in a local
church; a cappella singing of latin masses sets a quasi-mystical scene as
ancient figures are conjured from their tombs into recitations in
middle-English.
This does not, of course, explain how a teenage boy living in the mid-18th
century came to master medieval language. More seriously, it is hard to
suspend disbelief far enough to admit Tim Crouch's Thomas, who is
bumptiously unappealing in his assumption of childish moods and mannerisms.
Julia Limer's production is simply not strong enough to carry off the
inversions that lead to a boy who looks years older than his mother (Carrie
Wale) and a grandmother (Luke Williams) who seems designed to keep the whole
piece on the level of travesty.

A JOURNEY ON FOOT IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
The way some Britons from the past told it, few people wanted to set foot on 
Glen Coe, one of the most spectacular mountain enclaves in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
To Dorothy Wordsworth, who journeyed through the great Scottish gorge with her 
brother, William, in the early 19th Century, it seemed a "wild and desolate 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
To Charles Dickens, a few decades later, Glen Coe was "perfectly terrible . . . 
an awful place. If you should happen to have your hat on, take it off that your 
hair may stand on end." 
</P>
<P>
Glen Coe remains wild even today, but "perfectly terrible" it is not. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Wordsworth got it right when, after her maidenly Victorian shuddering, 
she selected another adjective to describe the scene: "sublime." 
</P>
<P>
And though there is a luxury hotel at one end, a tourist information center and 
a paved road through the pass, Glen Coe still rates its share of hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
With its yawning chasms, its beetling crags towering above and its hawks 
hovering against the skyline, Glen Coe remains the metaphor for 19th-Century 
romanticism. For once the cliches hold true. And as if this weren't enough, 
there is its history containing a bloody, brutal massacre involving the 
Macdonalds and the Campbells of Glenlyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outdoor Paradise 
</P>
<P>
Today Glen Coe is famous for being an outdoor paradise. The beetling crags are 
used by climbers and the towering peaks by a growing contingent of 
nature-lovers and hikers, a group I joined recently for a week of walking the 
High Tops. 
</P>
<P>
I soon discovered that within 20 miles of Ballachulish, the snug village at 
Glen Coe's foot that we used as a base, there lies some of the most magnificent 
walking country in Europe; and with its road and rail links to the south, some 
of the most accessible in terms of true wilderness. Glen Coe also is close to 
the heart of the splendid Scottish Highlands. 
</P>
<P>
From Bridge of Coe, which marks the beginning of the gorge, to Meeting of Three 
Waters at the head of the pass, Glen Coe is six miles long. Within a short 
distance are many of Scotland's finest peaks, including Ben Nevis, Britain's 
highest, and the lochs and islands that form a picturesque backdrop to the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genuine Mountains 
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Highlands, despite their diminutive size (Ben Nevis is only 4,406 
feet high) are real mountains, with knife-edge aretes, cliffs hundreds of feet 
high and weather that notoriously can bring blinding midsummer snowstorms. 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the peaks rise abruptly from sea level, the climbs are equal to 
any in the Eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Glen Coe, 12,000 acres of the finest wilderness are overseen by the Scottish 
National Trust, permanently protected from commercial exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
In the week with the British hikers we scaled six of these mountains, each 
involving more than 3,000 feet of climb and at least a 12-mile hike, with such 
evocative Gaelic names as Buchaille Etive Mor, Sgoor Dhearg, Beninn a' Bheithit 
and, most tongue-twisting of all, Stob Coire na h-Eirghe. 
</P>
<P>
Of these the grandest by far is Buchaille Etive Mor, a majestic, naked pyramid 
that dominates the pass of Glen Coe and Rannoch Moor, a desolate plateau to the 
south. Buchaille Etive Mor means "big herdsman," and its presence is 
appropriately commanding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winter Ice Climb 
</P>
<P>
The Buchaille is known for its tensile rock -- a rough rhyolite -- and for 
Crowberry Ridge, an ice climb used in winter as a practice run by the original 
conquerors of Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
But the peak also contains more modest ascents. Our group contained three 
leaders and we had three choices: a tricky rock ridge that was a low-grade 
technical climb beyond my capability, a hike of alleged "medium" difficulty 
that joined the ridge route at the summit and a walk up Devil's Staircase, 
which sounded scary but was actually an old military road from 1750, a snap! 
</P>
<P>
The medium hike seemed about my speed, particularly as two plucky sisters in 
our group, Mary and Elizabeth, both in their 70s, went along. If they could 
walk it, I (a fairly spry 62) also could do it, or so I thought. 
</P>
<P>
The trail led steeply to a deep gash in the mountainside, corrie as the Scots 
call it, with a wall that, from below, appeared uncompromisingly vertical. 
</P>
<P>
What appeared perpendicular was a series of rock slopes that could be 
surmounted. Nevertheless, a slip could have resulted in injury, and the 
climbers certainly would have been safeguarded by wire ropes on crags in the 
Alps. 
</P>
<P>
There were some tricky moments but we made it to the top, puffing and panting, 
elated and triumphant as we looked back. 
</P>
<P>
We were rewarded by an exhilarating ridge walk, the kind that abound in 
Scotland, with sweeping views of the surrounding valleys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Munro's Mountains 
</P>
<P>
The several peaks we climbed around Glen Coe go by another Scottish sobriquet: 
Each is a Munro, a title given to mountains 3,000 feet and higher, and first 
listed by Sir Hugh Munro, a Scottish mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
There are 276 of these peaks, some remote and some many miles from the nearest 
highway. But a growing fraternity of Munro addicts' aim is to climb the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Munro-bagging, however, can become a costly and time-consuming obsession. A 
friend living in the south of England drives at least 1,000 miles (at $3.40 a 
gallon) on long weekends to nab a few extra peaks. He has climbed 180. 
</P>
<P>
The most celebrated Munro is the "Cloud-Capped Hill of Heaven" or the 
"Heaven-Kissed Hill," depending which translation from Gaelic you prefer for 
Ben Nevis. Thousands climb Ben Nevis each year and our group was eager to join 
the pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the climb up Ben Nevis has gained the reputation of an easy 
amble: An automobile chugged to the top in 1911 and there have been numerous 
gimmicky ascents since, including a grand piano that was propelled up the trail 
to publicize a charity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trail Demands Stamina 
</P>
<P>
Runners sprint up and down the 10-mile round trip on what is condescendingly 
known as the "Tourist Path." The record is under 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Ben Nevis demands stamina. Sometimes it kills. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the mountain is slashed by hurricane-force winds and rain and the summit 
is shrouded in impenetrable mists. 
</P>
<P>
Snow sometimes lingers throughout the year and glaciers could form if the peak 
were a few hundred feet higher. In a recent 15-year period 50 deaths were 
recorded, some due to exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Our group continually was warned to prepare for the worst. But for us, Ben 
Nevis put on a rare smiling face: sunny, cloud-flecked skies, temperatures in 
the low 60s, a perfect crystal-clear day. 
</P>
<P>
Our leaders offered two alternative routes: the Tourist Path or a knife-edge 
ridge with acrophobia-inspiring drops on either side. 
</P>
<P>
I chose the easier way and had no regrets, because it allowed us to spend 90 
minutes at the summit enjoying the view. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the whole of Scotland was at our feet: from the snowcapped 
Cairngorm Mountains in the east, across the huge cleft of the Great Glen and on 
to the Atlantic Ocean in the west with those bizarrely named islands -- Muck, 
Eigg, Rhum, Mull and Skye -- rising dreamlike from the sea. Visibility: 150 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
A popular hike in the heart of Glen Coe leads to the Coirre Gabhail of "Lost 
Valley," because the upper corrie is invisible from below in the glen. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaelic name has another meaning, the Corrie of Capture, and for good 
reason. There the Macdonalds, the Scottish clan that inhabited Glen Coe, hid 
their plundered cattle. 
</P>
<P>
It is there, too, that 40 of 200 were killed by the Campbells in the infamous 
Glencoe massacre, a saga of murder, mayhem, deception and treacherous abuse of 
hospitality about 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If you climb to the Lost Valley you will find no trace of the carnage. But the 
hike, a steep but easy climb from the Glen Coe road, is worthwhile. Once above 
the rocks, however, you'll suddenly see the hidden valley, desolate and wild, 
hemmed in by soaring crags. 
</P>
<P>
Here is some information, if you hike in the Scottish Highlands: 
</P>
<P>
It rains, sometimes prodigiously, on Ben Nevis a staggering 157 inches 
annually. This means that the hillsides often resemble quagmires. Wear good 
rain gear and tough hiking boots. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the mountains lack trails. Paths sometimes are inadequately blazed or 
cairned. The British believe this keeps things "natural," but it can be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain know-how is essential, unless you hike with a group and are led on 
recognized routes. 
</P>
<P>
While the hiking is splendid, don't spend all your time on the High Tops. 
Explore more afield in Lochaber, the region surrounding Glen Coe. 
</P>
<P>
A rented car is useful but not essential: A bus route links Ballachulish with 
rail and steamer services to many nearby lochs and islands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medieval Castles 
</P>
<P>
Oban, a picturesque fishing port, and Ft. William, great for souvenir shopping, 
are a few miles away. Medieval castles seem to sprout from every lake side. 
</P>
<P>
Several British travel organizations offer hiking programs in the Western 
Highlands. Among them: Holiday Fellowship, most convenient to Glen Coe, with 
centers in adjacent Ballachulish, alongside Loch Leven and in nearby Loch Awe. 
The Loch Awe center is a converted railroad hotel with its own railroad 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Both centers operate late April through early October, with weekly rates 
between $300 and $340 per person double, including accommodations and meals. 
</P>
<P>
The cost includes guided hikes but not transportation to trail heads. In 
addition, Holiday Fellowship has an agreement with British Rail that permits 
round-trip travel to the Scottish centers from London for $55, less than a 
third of the regular fare. Contact HF Holiday, 142-144 Great North Way, London, 
England NW4 1EG. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hiking on Mull 
</P>
<P>
Ramblers Holidays offers weeklong hiking on the Isle of Mull, the largest of 
Scotland's Inner Hebrides, from mid-May through September for a tour charge of 
about $305 per person double occupancy, including all meals. 
</P>
<P>
This operator also offers reduced rail fares but cites them only on 
application. Ramblers Holidays, P.O. Box 43, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, 
England AL8 6PQ. 
</P>
<P>
Icelandair flies to Glasgow, Scotland, from Chicago and has an agreement with 
America West for the Los Angeles-Chicago leg of the flight, with connections in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
A shuttle bus operates between Ft. William and Oban, with stops in 
Ballachulish. Rental cars are available in Ft. William and Oban. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to hike independently rather than on tour, there is a wide range 
of hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast inns. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels include Ballachulish, Loch Leven and Alt Nan Ros. Rates fall between $25 
and $40 per person double occupancy, with breakfast. B&amp;Bs are $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
There are tourist information centers in Ballachulish and the village of 
Glencoe, with details of events, hotels, outdoor activities and maps. 
</P>

<HL> Fine Art Is Now on Exhibit in Many Ads --- But Critics Say Commercial Use Cheapens the Great Masterpieces </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ronald Alsop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   When Edouard Manet unveiled his "Luncheon on the Grass" in 1863, many Parisians were scandalized by the depiction of a nude woman picnicking with two fully dressed men. 

   Times change. 
Today, the painting is being used to sell grocery products and charge cards. 

   "Luncheon on the Grass" turned up in all its glory last year in magazine advertisements for both Rice-a-Roni Savory Classics and the American Express Card. 
"Before Savory Classics, people went to extremes to make meals interesting," quipped the Rice-a-Roni ad. 

   To some art connoisseurs, the ads were demeaning to Manet. 
But at least the French painter is in good company. 
Lately, advertisers have developed an appreciation for fine art: They are using works by Gauguin, Monet, Raphael and many other painters to promote everything from men's cologne to candy bars to bathroom toilets. 

   The burgeoning use of fine art in ads is hotly debated among museum officials, some of whom worry about cheapening the world's greatest masterpieces. 
The National Gallery of Art, in Washington, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts are among museums that refuse to deal with advertisers -- although that doesn't always prevent marketers from using their paintings. 
At the other extreme are museums that freely license art to ad agencies to help balance their budgets. 

   "Advertisers have become much more interested in our art works, and we study their requests on a case-by-case basis," says Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
"Unfortunately, some proposed uses are flip and disrespectful." 

   Museum executives most resent advertisers who alter paintings, usually by inserting their products into the picture. 
In a Hershey commercial, a van Gogh self-portrait and a ballerina in a Degas painting are shown holding candy bars. 
American Express Co. inserted a charge-card receipt into the hands of a woman in Georges Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." 
And for an ad promoting a chunky variety of spaghetti sauce, Prince Co. commissioned a drawing of a chubby Mona Lisa. 

   "Seurat's 'Sunday Afternoon' and Grant Wood's 'American Gothic' have been corrupted in ads so often they've lost their integrity," says Cisley Celmer, an official at the Milwaukee Art Museum. 

   But the Art Institute of Chicago, which owns both works, doesn't object to the parodies. 
"I think the send-ups of our paintings are a riot," says Lyn DelliQuadri, the museum's director of graphics and reproductions. 
The money is nice, too. 
She says the Art Institute rents transparencies of its works to advertisers for fees of $250 to $1,000. 

   For advertisers, art is a way to create an image of quality or luxury for their products. 
Famous paintings lend a touch of class to a brand name, whether it's Doral Saturnia spa in Miami (which uses Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus"), Fancy Feast cat food (Goya's "Don Manuel Osorio de Zuniga") or Sharp office copiers (Raphael's "Portrait of Maddalena Doni"). 

   "Even if you can't afford the best of everything, you can afford the best of one thing," proclaims an ad for Red Devil paint that features a Degas painting. 
In ads headlined "Evolution of the Species," Jaguar Cars Inc. places its autos in lush jungle landscapes evocative of Henri Rousseau. 

   "Putting a product with a masterpiece says more about its quality than any words can express," says Jim Tennant, a creative director at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, which created an ad for Porcher bathroom fixtures that featured a work by Henri Matisse. 

   Museum officials and art historians say advertisers' use of classic paintings is a sign that fine art has become a more central part of American culture. 
"The growing popularity of art-history courses in colleges and blockbuster art exhibitions has given the advertising world a new pool of sophisticated imagery on which to draw," says Robert Baldwin, an art historian at Connecticut College. 

   Last spring, the Lintas ad agency in London reacted swiftly to the $39.9 million sale of one of van Gogh's sunflower paintings. 
Within a few days, it commissioned an artist to copy the van Gogh work -- with a tub of Unilever's Flora margarine alongside the vase of sunflowers. 
The ad's tag line: "Very tasty if you've got the bread." 

   Advertisers these days also are trading increasingly on the cultural appeal of classical music and literature. 
A spot for Honda's Accord features a work by Chopin, and opera music is part of ads for wine, fancy perfumes and even laundry detergent. 

   Recently, TV viewers also have heard actress Elizabeth Taylor reciting passages from William Shakespeare and John Dryden in commercials for her Passion perfume. 
And print ads for the Sterling car include poetry by Robert Louis Stevenson, William Wordsworth and Andrew Marvell. 

   But advertisers are making even more use of the world's premier art -- though doing so isn't always easy. 
When marketers want to use a work by a living artist, they merely consult him for permission. 
For a deceased artist whose works aren't yet in the public domain -- generally, one who has been dead for less than 50 years -- advertisers usually must turn to the artist's heirs. 

   "We take into account the propriety of an ad and the amount of the fee to be paid, but rejections occur pretty frequently," says Theodore Feder, president of New York-based Artists Rights Society, which represents museums, artists and their heirs. 
One such rejection occurred when a company wanted to use a Jackson Pollock painting to illustrate the activity of a dental-care product. 

   An artist's heirs often raise objections if a work is put to a use they haven't approved. 
Recently, a dispute erupted over a magazine ad for Porcher toilets, sinks and bidets that includes a reproduction of Matisse's "Large Reclining Nude." 
Artists Rights Society, representing the estate of Matisse, who died in 1954, has complained about the use of the painting to Porcher and its ad agency, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding. 
Officials of the Baltimore Museum of Art, which owns the work, are also quite perturbed. 

   "It was a slur on Matisse," says Nancy Press, the Baltimore museum's coordinator of rights and reproductions. 
"I don't agree with the premise that you can use anything to sell anything. 
We walk a straight line when it comes to the integrity of art." 

   Foote Cone executives say they believed the work was in the public domain and free for the agency to use. 
"Even though it was a toilet, the painting was appropriate because it's a French toilet that's beautifully crafted," says Mr. Tennant, the creative director at Foote Cone. 
"The toilet's wonderful lines, shapes and colors were a natural parallel with Matisse's work." 
Mr. Tennant says the agency is negotiating a settlement with the Matisse estate. 

   Control of paintings in the public domain -- which include impressionist, post-impressionist and most other works that advertisers want to reproduce -- generally falls to the museums that hold them. 
Although the museums normally don't have any copyright claims to such works, they do control the color transparencies that provide much higher-quality reproduction than would a post card or photograph in an art book. 
Because good reproduction is so important in advertising, agencies typically won't use a certain painting unless they can get the transparencies. 

   Richard Tooke, supervisor of rights and reproductions at New York's Museum of Modern Art, won't release his transparencies to advertisers. 
"We're the keepers of works of art," he explains, "and feel it would be presumptuous of us to decide whether an artist would want his paintings commercialized." 

   Even so, Mr. Tooke concedes, some advertisers reproduce his museum's paintings, whether from post cards, books or other sources. 
For example, he says, a furniture-company ad features "The Sleeping Gypsy," by Rousseau, which hangs in the Museum of Modern Art. 
"But there's really nothing we can do about that legally," he says. 

   For their part, ad agency creative directors believe many museums are overly protective of their works. 
Advertisers contend that they are serving an educational purpose by exposing more people to fine art through their ads. 

   As for tampering with some paintings for comic effect, they believe that it's harmless and that many of the artists probably would have been amused, even flattered. 
Indeed, some famous artists dabbled in commercial work themselves. 
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec designed posters for cabarets in Paris and for makers of furniture, printing ink and bicycle chains. 
More recently, Andy Warhol created an ad for Absolut vodka. 

   "I don't believe classic images in art are sacred," says Laurie Solomon, associate creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the ad agency that stuck Hershey bars in famous paintings. 
"Paintings are part of the culture and are meant to be enjoyed."

FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Bronte country can go with the wind - Nigel Spivey
suggests an unorthodox solution to the Haworth moors controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade ago, the correct position for the liberal intellectual of London
NW3 was clear enough. Support the Yorkshire coal miners; rally behind the
time-honoured extraction of fossil fuels; defy the Thatcherite logic of pit
closures.
It was a cause both brave and easy to espouse. To the literary mind, it
called up comfortingly noble images of gaunt men in hob-nailed boots
gathering under great iron wheels, or women in shawls mashing tea by
blackened cottage hearths. Futile, of course: if coal is not wanted, coal
miners must pass away, whether Hampstead cherishes them or not.
So the North gets the message. No-one wants fossil fuels, and in any case
they cause holes in the atmosphere. Robbed of their collieries, the district
councils of Lancashire and Yorkshire hit upon new schemes for lighting their
streets and boiling their kettles.
This is wind power. Hitherto the stuff of New Age dreamers in far-off parts
of west Wales and Jutland, or schemes which got no further than the
blueprints of crank utopians, wind power must have blown into the practical
North on the wings of divine inspiration.
What could be better? No shortage of breezes up on the moors; no shortage of
under-subsidised hill farmers, ready to turn wind into brass; best of all,
no shortage of right-on one-upmanship, as the grimy North shows the pure
South what energy can be generated without a smidgin of uranium or mess.
But what the councillors of Bradford and Calderdale reckoned without is the
alternative map of England. This enjoys only minority acknowledgement, but
that minority is articulate, noisy and influential. According to its
preferred nomenclature, England is divided along the proprietorial lines of
distinguished writers. So you could travel from Daphne du Maurier's
Cornwall, progress to Hardy's Wessex; perhaps head up to Housman's
Shropshire, and across to Bennett's Midlands; thence up through Lawrence's
Nottingham and onwards to Wordsworth's Lakes. In the course of this journey,
naturally, you would have to negotiate the Brontes' Yorkshire.
The Brontes' Yorkshire. The passport for entry is to have read Emily
Bronte's Wuthering Heights; the objective of travelling there is to see the
old family parsonage, home to the Bronte Society since 1927; perhaps seek
out the site of Thrushcross Grange, or Lowood School, or the Haworth
graveyard.
But, above all, to cast your gaze across the same tussocked wilderness as
met the eyes of Cathy and Heathcliff; watch the same plovers dip into the
ling; inhale the same heady west wind. It is still a fair impetuous wind.
And the crime of the local councils is to have tamed it into boiling
kettles.
Leafy Hampstead sprang into alliance with the Brontes' Yorkshire last week
with a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, signed by 60 names.
Admittedly, they are not homogeneously Hampstead: Iris Murdoch sits oddly
with Cliff Richard, who (odder still) plans to be Heathcliff in a new London
musical, and the coalition of Ted Hughes with Auberon Waugh is provoking.
But these signatories are bound by the insistence that wind turbines shall
not be erected within a 20-mile radius of Haworth (sorry, the Brontes'
Haworth), because they constitute 'an assault upon our artistic and our
literary heritage.'
When utopian dreams of putting wind to work are turned into blasphemies
against nature, one has to question the pieties behind this protest. It is
an unusual conflict, in which the conservationists of the earth's atmosphere
find themselves opposed by conservationists of a literary ambience.
The reason is that in the secular society of modern intellectuals, the
houses of great writers have supplanted saintly shrines as places of
pilgrimage. Relics must be preserved, the landscape of worship maintained.
Seeing is believing. We will not understand Wuthering Heights if we cannot
roll our eyes across Emily's own moors. That must be the ultimate ground on
which the protestors stand.
Thus exposed, it reduces to a naive view of the human imagination. And it
imposes a strictly Romantic definition upon beauty, whereby wilderness alone
is chief of the muses. It would be interesting to learn how many of the
protestors would consider retrospectively demolishing all the windmills of
Suffolk - Constable's Suffolk - or indeed that unsightly water mill at
Flatford. Or are such man-made intrusions acceptable once touched by the
brush or pen of a genius?
Here lies the only solution to this issue. Bradford council, which is
hospitable to the creative spirit, must commission a work of art. It may be
a poem, a novel or a grand painting; it may be a film, even a soap opera. An
everyday tale of wind-farming folk: their trials, passions, couplings and
bereavements. If it is done, and done well, I dare say we will look kindly
upon the turbines of the West Riding.

   Parents are urged to begin saving for
college even before their kids are out of diapers.
   But, if they do, will that eliminate them from consideration for
financial help later?
   No, says James Scannell of the University of Rochester.
   ``Colleges and universities follow standard guidelines in
determining financial need. They do not penalize those who have
saved for education.
   ``For example, if parents have accumulated $100,000 in assets,
only about 5 percent of those funds will be counted in a needs
analysis. That is, a parent will be expected to contribute only
$5,000 toward tuition.''

   What do you do when your parents no longer can
care for themselves?
   Here are some housing alternatives for the elderly from Family
Circle magazine. For specific referral assistance, call the agency
for aging in your area and ask about the following programs:
   _ Shared Housing and Matching Programs: Here, two or more
unrelated people share a house. Usually, the living, kitchen and
bathroom areas are communal but each person has a bedroom or other
private space.
   _ Accessory Apartments: These are in underoccupied single-family
houses that are large enough to accommodate a separate apartment
with its own entrance.
   _ Elderly Cottage Housing Opportunity: These self-contained
units are built for an elderly parent on your own house lot. Many
of these dwellings are prefabricated.
   _ Retirement and ``Life-Care'' Communities: These range from
places for those in good health to those who need 24-hour nursing
care. Some have rental apartments, co-ops, condos, one-family
cottages and services that keep pace with the changing needs of the
residents.

DORCHESTER, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to Browning, this is the poetic time of year along the back 
roads of southwest England, when walking trails begin to flower with spring 
blossoms all the way from Dorset, the Cotswolds and the moors of Dartmoor to 
the Scottish countryside. 
</P>
<P>
To travel through the Dorset countryside, my wife, Elfriede, and I brought one 
backpack from home, which is all we needed for overnighting in village inns 
before returning to our base in this historic country town of about 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
Driving through the southwest of England by rental car from London, we used 
Dorchester two times as a base for backpack hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Every hike around the Dorset region is an adventure of the mind, confirming the 
words spoken by Hippocrates 2,400 years ago: "Walking is man's best medicine." 
</P>
<P>
This has been called Thomas Hardy country. It's part of his novels and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Over Hill and Dale 
</P>
<P>
Side roads, cow paths and walking trails, and names of villages, hills and 
rivers make their own poetry and folk tales: Melbury Osmond and Minterne Magna, 
Piddle River, Puddletown and Plush. 
</P>
<P>
Cows and sheep graze along the way. Ruins of Iron Age forts emerge from rolling 
downs. We walked to the top of Batcombe Hill, then descended to soft green 
pastures. 
</P>
<P>
The 180-foot Cerne Giant dared us to climb his chalk hillside, which we did. He 
presides over the inns, pubs and old houses of Cerne Abbas, and probably was 
carved into the hillside in Roman times. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking the countryside and walking the villages offers what other great writers 
have said about Dorset. 
</P>
<P>
T. E. Lawrence wrote "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" at his Clouds Hill cottage. 
He's buried at Moreton village, half a dozen miles east of Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Austen brought the village of Lyme Regis into her novel "Persuasion," as 
did John Fowles in his "French Lieutenant's Woman." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Hardy who immortalized the countryside. He spent much of his long 
and creative life here, from 1840 to 1928. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Novel Setting 
</P>
<P>
It's only a three-mile walk from Dorchester to the village of Higher 
Bockhampton, where the cottage of Hardy's birth and boyhood is a National Trust 
property. The cottage gardens are open from March to October, and you can phone 
for an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking on across the brooding stillness of Edgon Heath, we could feel why Hardy 
made it a setting for "The Return of the Native," and why his life in Dorset 
could inspire "Far from the Madding Crowd." The financial success of the latter 
novel enabled him to build his Max Gate home just outside Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
The walk from Max Gate into Dorchester is a return to the cobbled streets Hardy 
walked for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has his original manuscript of "The Mayor of Casterbridge," the name 
Hardy gave to Dorchester in his novel. To the Romans it was Durnovaria. 
</P>
<P>
The town's Thomas Hardy Society has prepared walking guides to the streets and 
country lanes around it. 
</P>
<P>
King's Arms coaching inn at the old town center of Dorchester is a gracious 
place to shed a backpack. Hardy used it for scenes in his Casterbridge novel. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has 31 bedrooms with private baths; one has a four-poster. The dining 
room, two bars. 
</P>
<P>
A room for two is about $110 U.S. Call for reservations. Along the Dorset 
hiking trails, village inns such as Summer Lodge in Evershot and Plumber Manor 
at Sturminster Newton have double accommodations at about $50 U.S. Farmhouse 
lodging can cost half that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scheduled Treks 
</P>
<P>
The three Englishmen who founded The Wayfarers walking tours open their sixth 
season of countryside adventures on April 16. The 28 scheduled treks will 
conclude Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other walking tours in England are being offered by such organizations as 
Toronto-based Butterfield &amp; Robinson, and Dales Centre Ltd. through the 
Yorkshire Dales, sponsored by Lord Willie Peel and his associate, Terry Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day, six-night Wayfarers walking adventures average about 10 miles 
daily for a group of about a dozen hikers. A walk leader charts the course and 
introduces historic sights. Luggage is transported to picnics or pub lunches 
and to overnights with dinner at country inns. 
</P>
<P>
The hiking routes cover Hardy's Dorset, Wordsworth's Lake District, Sir Walter 
Scott's Borders, James Herriot's Yorkshire, Devon Coast and Dartmoor, a 
Cotswold Way, Cornwall Creeks and Coves, Wales Border Castles. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy's Dorset hiking tour begins in Sherborne, the town of an old abbey and 
Sir Walter Raleigh's two castles. 
</P>
<P>
It continues to Cerne Abbas and its cliffside giant, Hardy's "Tess of the 
D'Urbervilles" countryside and a 13th-Century manor house, Hardy's Cottage and 
his grave at Stinsford Church. Afterward a farewell dinner in Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of each hiking tour is 595 (about $1,065 U.S.), including breakfast, 
lunch and dinner daily, transportation of baggage, tips and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States contact The Wayfarers, 166 Thames St., Newport, R.I. 
02840, (401) 849-5087.

   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing as a code-breaker is one
of the legends of the second world war. Around 1944, when the German naval
codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher
school at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, Turing had (in the words of his
biographer, Andrew Hodges) 'learned how to build a brain - not an electric
brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic
brain.'
If Turing were alive today - the harsh English law against homosexual men
led to his untimely death in 1954 - he would surely take a well-deserved
pride in the universal labour-saving which the electronic brain he and other
pioneers conceived plays in all our lives. He might have foreseen that it
would revolutionise business and industrial practices, and that it would
take over much of the ground-work in applied mathematics, the engineering
sciences, physics and astronomy; but could he have imagined the inroads it
has now begun to make into the area known traditionally as the humanities?
Some of the most hitherto insoluble problems of authorship have begun to
yield to scrutiny by Turing's electronic brain. The identity of the
acidulous Whig activist who contributed letters to the public prints,
attacking George III and other 18th century worthies under the pseudonym
'Junius,' was one of the earliest pieces of successful, computer-based
research analysing an author's style. Swedish scholar Alvar Ellgard
published his conclusions in A Statistical Method for Determining Authorship
(1962), where he established the overwhelming probability that the
scurrilous letters were written by Sir Philip Francis, Gibbon's schoolmaster
and later a civil servant.
Work of this kind where each word and punctuation mark in a text is computed
into lists, charts and graphs designed to show the number of times it is
used in a given type of sentence-formation - plotted against a putative norm
 -once required the resource of a mainframe computer, the kind of machine
available only to a scholar working in some handsomely endowed university
research centre. Now, though, the equipment to undertake such a project is
coming within the reach of anyone with a reasonably efficient modern home
computer.
Many of the Oxford dictionaries are now on computer disc and available
commercially to the ordinary 'user'; so are several of the standard texts of
the Oxford English School. The Oxford University Press has in train an
extensive programme of electronic publishing, as I discovered on a visit to
its headquarters at Walton Street, Oxford.
'Look here upon this picture, and on this . . .' as Hamlet says. In this
instance, Picture One depicts 20 heavy, large, dark-blue volumes occupying
4.5 ft of shelf space and costing around Pounds 1,500 for the set (according
to the bargain you strike with your supplier). Picture Two shows what author
Anthony Burgess calls a 'silver beer mat'; in other words, a compact disc.
This particular one costs Pounds 495.00. Both accommodate exactly the same
amount of information - the entire contents of the Oxford English Dictionary
2nd edition (1989). In the first instance, all you need is a strong pair of
arms and reasonably good eyesight;. in the second, a personal computer (PC)
fitted with a CD-ROM drive.
This is a gadget that extends a computer's memory vastly, necessary when the
machine has to take on board the OED's 500,000 head words, their
definitions, pronunciation, etymology, and the 24m quotations that
illustrate their use in texts since the beginning of English. Many libraries
and institutions have such a drive but most private PC owners do not
(although it is becoming less expensive and is likely to become a standard
option for them fairly soon). To run the OED electronically, you also need
to have the Microsoft system known as Windows (version 3 or above); a
Macintosh version of the OED 2nd edition will be available next spring.
In this form, the OED has become a lexical database. Its users are able to
look up English words in a variety of different ways, not just
alphabetically as before. The entire dictionary may be scanned in less than
a minute to give the answer to abstruse searches. Colonel Pickering in
Pygmalion was an authority on spoken Sanskrit and was working with Professor
Higgins on Indian dialect words in English. He would have been overjoyed at
being able to 'wild card' - that is, put an asterisk against typical
end-formations in English of the kind of words in which he was interested
and, within 40 seconds, to have on screen a complete list of all such words
in the dictionary. At a more frivolous level, crossword addicts may use the
wild card command to find words of which they know only certain letters.
There is an obvious benefit in having the OED available in this electronic
form for its editors and compilers; it releases them from an incalculable
amount of donkey work. Looking to the future, the editors now have the task
of preparing the 3rd edition of the OED, scheduled for publication in 2005.
Will there need to be a printed version of the 3rd edition at all or will by
then everyone be using it electronically?
That is a question to which the OUP does not yet know the answer. What is
becoming clear is that the old system of issuing supplements between
editions in order to keep up to date with new words and fresh shades of
meaning can now be abandoned because these neologisms can, as soon as they
are identified, be added to the database.
It is not only lexicography that it is being given a new lease of life by
the computer but classical and literary scholarship as well. Computers have
been aiding scholars in deciphering early languages like Ancient Egyptian
for many years, but now they are moving in force into the study of
literature.
The Americans have a project to put the whole of English poetry, from
Langland to Larkin, on to computer disc, and some classical texts studied in
the Oxford Greats School are available as software. The Bodleian Library in
Oxford has a terminal in the reading room and classics dons at work on
Virgil or Horace can be seen operating it.
The OUP has just launched its Oxford Electronic Texts Library for English
literature. This consists of The Complete Works of Jane Austen (Pounds 60),
The Riverside Chaucer (Pounds 75), The Poetical Works of Samuel Coleridge
(Pounds 60), and The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth (Pounds 60). These
are all out now, and coming next Spring will be electronic versions of
Hardy, Milton, Mary Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft.
The controversial modern spelling edition of William Shakespeare: The
Complete Works, edited by Wells and Taylor and published in 1986, is now
available to PC users at Pounds 95.
None of these electronic texts has the search functions that are built into
the electronic OED. They offer the standard Oxford texts on diskettes of
regular size in which each line, as well as each page of the text, is
enumerated. Used in combination with a text-analysis software package such
as Micro-OCP (Oxford Pounds 175.00), however, you can very easily get your
computer to make searches, word lists, concordances and indexes from them.
What use, though, is it for the person who does not happen to be studying
for a BA in English or a B Litt to have such a resource? Clearly, no use at
all. If you just want to sit by the swimming pool and read Northanger Abbey
for fun, you would be much better off with the Worlds Classics paperback.
But it is important, even to such a reader, to have a text as close as
possible to the one approved by the author. Computers can play an important
role in establishing an authentic text and, in some cases, establishing
authorship as well.
A new computer-based literary discipline called Stylology has begun to
emerge in which texts are submitted to computational tests not merely as
part of textual scholarship but also in the hope of arriving at new critical
insights. An outstanding example of this is the book Computation into
Criticsm: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels and An Experiment in Method by JF
Burrows (Oxford, Pounds 25.00). The author, an Australian professor of
English, checked the speech habits of all the main characters in Jane Austen
through an extended series of computer tests and collated them, using
methods borrowed from statistics, to determine variations from normal or
average usage.
Burrows' findings inevitably are the source of much debate in English
faculties. They have been welcomed warmly in an appreciative review by at
least one prominent member of the Oxbridge establishment: Marilyn Butler,
the Cambridge professor of English Literature. His charts and graphs of
pronoun usage by Elizabeth Bennett, Mr D'Arcy and the rest prove beyond any
doubt (if they prove nothing else) that, in a novel, the distinction made up
to now between the 'grammatical' words said to be inert, and the 'lexical'
words said to be the source of energy, no longer holds. Burrows shows in
innumerable ways how grammatical words are as great a source of fictional
energy as the lexical ones in character building, narrative development etc.
Move over, Dr Leavis, you have had your byte at the cherry. Now let the
computer have its turn.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Arts: Three premieres - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sense of place can create a potent spell in music. To take English
composers alone, it is difficult not to hear in Elgar's music the rolling
expanses of the Malvern Hills, in Vaughan Williams the pastoral English
countryside, or in Britten's more abrasive style the wind-swept, open vistas
of the Suffolk coast.
In John Casken's music the place is the North of England, the mood
invariably grey and chill. In the works that introduced him to Promenade
audiences in 1986 it was Northumberland that set the scene. This year he has
returned to the North and chosen a disused mine in Weardale as the setting
for his song-cycle Still mine, a BBC commission which had its first
performance at the Royal Albert Hall on Friday.
At best, it is an evocative work, as so much of Casken's music has proved to
be. There are four poems by different authors, but under the influence of an
atmospheric score they combine to make a plausibly unified theme. A man
leaves home to work as a miner in the North and, subsequently exiled for
striking, writes to his wife of hisdreams of returning - a palpable feeling
of remembrance and yearning runs through the cycle.
That emanates from the orchestra, as does most of what is good about this
piece.
The orchestral textures are complex and alluring. The strings form the basic
richness and density of sound; then wind, vibraphone and bells are overlaid
to add brilliance to the surface. But the orchestra is large for a work of
this kind and Casken is not sparing in his use of it, with the result that
the score often sounded overwritten.
The voice simply did not dominate as it should, although that was not the
only reason why. Despite trying to suggest some of the images in the poetry,
the vocal part lacks a strong profile and Thomas Allen's mellifluous singing
of its winding lines gave it none of the punch or variety that might have
created one. The final impression was of a lovely sound-world, but vague,
somewhat monotonous, without any live contact with the poems.
The orchestral part was in the care of Matthias Bamert and the BBC Symphony
Orchestra, who had already given a carefully-detailed performance of
Debussy's La Mer, and the evening ended with an above average account of
Sibelius's Fifth Symphony, which kept its concentration through to a
splendid final peroration.
On Saturday night the BBC Concert Orchestra under Barry Wordsworth
celebrated its 40th birthday with a generous programme of Tchaikovsky,
Milhaud, Gershwin and two new works by Richard Rodney Bennett.
The first, another BBC commission, was unabashed entertainment in the
composer's easy listening mode: Variations on the nursery rhyme 'Over the
hills and far away", served in a sugary sauce and orchestrated with not so
much a nod, as a deep bow to Ravel.
The other was a Concerto for Stan Getz, the saxophone player, who died last
year before he could perform it. The soloist here was John Harle, a virtuoso
and artistic personality equal to the flamboyant music - one foot in jazz,
one in classical - that Bennett has provided. What sounds like American
urban aggression propels the outer movements along vigorously, while the
elegiac centre brings bluesy improvisation. It is a concerto strong on
impact, well crafted to show off its soloist, professional writing in the
best sense.
