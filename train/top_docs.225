PIRAEUS, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were the Golden Greeks, fiercely independent men who controlled the 
world's shipping, built lush island paradises and married society's most 
glamorous women. 
</P>
<P>
Aristotle Onassis, Stavros Niarchos and their contemporaries are still revered 
in Piraeus, base of the powerful Greek shipping industry. But today a new 
tycoon is succeeding them: the young businessman who shuns publicity and knows 
computers as well as compasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, a shipowner was treated like a god," said Diamantis 
Diamantides, who controls 25 ships. "Now he's a simple person." 
</P>
<P>
The Greek shipping tradition is thousands of years old, a product of the 
country's entrepreneurial talent and its kinship with the sea, which is within 
50 miles of almost any part of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of the Greek tycoon began earlier this century with the "sea 
wolves," sea captains who acquired fleets. It reached its personification in 
Niarchos and Onassis, volatile, dynamic magnates with business savvy and a 
gambler's touch, whose lives and loves were chronicled on the front pages of 
the world press. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the newer managers have maintained their predecessors' passion for the 
sea and their strong preference for family-run firms. But they are increasingly 
making longer-term investments, imposing modern business practices and buying 
newer, high-tech ships. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tending toward structured companies in corporate form as opposed to 
personality-driven, Onassis-type companies," said Emmanuel A. Vordonis, 
director of Thenamaris Ships Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Greeks owned the world's largest merchant fleet. The Japanese 
are now No. 1, but Greece is close behind, with 82 million tons of 
cargo-carrying capacity, according to the authoritative shipping magazine 
Naftiliaki. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the change of style in owning Greek ships is due to the crisis that hit 
the industry from 1975 to 1987, stemming from overbuilding of ships and 
competitive freight-rate cutting at a time of stagnating world trade. This 
bustling port near Athens is still haunted by memories of proud shipowners 
losing their vessels to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Diamantides, 42, who began buying ships in 1975 after working in shipping 
offices, says old-time magnates could get bank loans on the strength of their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to convince them with your figures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Business practices also have changed with the infusion of a different kind of 
shipowner -- either entrepreneurs from industry or construction attracted by a 
potential fortune, or the children of traditional shipowners, who have received 
advanced degrees in business or engineering at British or American 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
"The new generation of managers has a different investment approach," said 
Dimitri Krondiras, the local director of Citibank, the major lender for Greek 
ship purchases. "This new generation perceives that investment in shipping is 
high-risk." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that gamble, some shipowners have diversified into oil, banking or 
hotel chains. Others are trying to cater more to the changing market, 
purchasing newer, more customized ships. 
</P>
<P>
A few shipowners are even beginning to raise money by opening their companies 
to outside investment and floating shares on the stock market -- previously "a 
kind of heresy in Greek ship owning," says George Anastassopoulos, the former 
head of the Transport Commission in the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
One example of the new Greek tycoon is Thanasis Martinos, whose family founded 
Thenamaris. Hailed as the "Mozart of shipping" for his precociousness, Martinos 
entered the business as a teen-ager when his mother and her brothers -- a 
shipping lawyer and a sea captain -- bought their first ship. 
</P>
<P>
Martinos worked with the firm while studying economics in London. Now 40, he 
and his two brothers head Thenamaris, which runs 55 ships itself and manages 
about 20 for other people. 
</P>
<P>
Vordonis, the director of the firm, says the older generation "had the risk 
approach, the hard-work approach, the entrepreneurial approach to bringing 
resources together that were difficult to bring together." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, shipowners rely on high-speed information relayed by computers, 
tight cost control and a team approach. 
</P>
<P>
Where old-style magnates used to make most decisions, sometimes screaming down 
cowering subordinates, the modern entrepreneurs are trying to attract and rely 
on technical experts to keep up with a fast-moving, efficient, more high-tech 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve, you need technology, modern management techniques," 
Vordonis says. "You go into how to manage people." 
</P>
<P>
A glance at the Thenamaris offices illustrates the change. Unlike the 
traditional rough-and-tumble offices tucked along the Piraeus waterfront, 
Thenamaris is a gleaming, glass-and-concrete ring in a lush coastal suburb. 
Sunlight pours into an airy core; water trickles through leafy plants in a 
central atrium. 
</P>
<P>
"We have round tables, where everyone feels equal. We tried to make it as 
friendly as possible," Vordonis says. "In addition to achieving efficiency, you 
must have people working in a high tone." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to keeping a lower profile at the office, the new tycoons avoid 
publicity in their private lives. Gone are the days when Niarchos and Onassis 
competed in the public eye, building ever-bigger yachts and purchasing islands 
they turned into paradises with imported trees and exotic birds. 
</P>
<P>
Onassis dominated gossip columns through his affair with opera singer Maria 
Callas and later his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, while Niarchos married, 
among others, Charlotte Ford, daughter of auto maker Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Today's shipowners keep elegant villas with swimming pools in Athens' northern 
suburbs and vacation getaways on the Greek islands, as well as homes in London, 
Switzerland or Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
But they are content to stay out of the spotlight.

earlier this century with the ``sea wolves,'' sea captains who
acquired vast fleets, dynamic magnates with business savvy and a

   Today's shipowners keep elegant villas with swimming pools in
Athens' northern suburbs and vacation getaways on the Greek
islands, as well as homes in London, Switzerland or Monte Carlo.
   But they are content to stay out of the spotlight. Some say a
high profile would hurt their efforts to emphasize a team approach
in their businesses.
   Whether the new tycoons will achieve the success of their
predecessors is still an open question.
   Many firms are still run by the older generation, with their
sons or daughters waiting in the wings to test newer business
strategies.
   And while the younger managers may have more sophisticated
economic approaches, shipowning is still highly risky and dependent
on many outside factors, such as wars and the price of oil.
   Anastassopoulos says the new shipping executives go to the best
schools and are better prepared than their predecessors. But, he
adds, ``Whether they will be as intelligent and adventurous as
their fathers remains to be seen.''

<TEXT>
There has been mileage in Homer since 600BC when the 'Sons of Homer' formed
a guild for public readings of The Iliad and The Odyssey.
Alan Howard and Christopher Logue are continuing the tradition with Kings at
the Cottesloe Theatre, a reading from Logue's 1991 version of the first two
books of The Iliad.
This two-man, 90-minute performance shows how compelling epic can be when
well presented.
Aristotle was right to think that it should be read and not acted. Logue's
Kings follows his epic companion piece, War Music (1981), which comprised a
version of books 16-19 of The Iliad.
His story keeps close to Homer, recounts the growing dissent among the
Greeks, their reaction to the imperiousness of Agamemnon, the sulking of
Achilles at the loss of his captured woman, Briseis, and the fatal prayer he
offers to his mother Thetis, to make the Greeks suffer.
Homeric style combines seriousness and accessibility: armies are compared to
forest fires, or flies around a milk pail.
Logue has caught the scope and pitch of Homeric epic by using translations
from Chapman (1611) to Rieu (1950) and evolving a supple, muscular verse.
He has also preserved the wit in Homer. Besides the whining, jibing
Thersites, there is a malicious Athena ('We have arranged another death for
Agamemnon') and a skyful of ludic gods: 'How can a mortal make a god smile?
Tell him his plans.'
The Homeric lyricism has also been kept: retained: 'The dawn stepped
barefooted from her lover's bed and shared her beauty with the clouds.'
Logue has wisely kept his own speaking contributions relatively slight. The
evening is carried by Howard.
From the opening lines, 'Think of the East Aegean sea by night ..', Howard
is magnificent, delivering the speeches of Greeks and Gods seamlessly
intercut with passages of narration.
He crouches for the opening on a tall stool, fists clenched, conjuring
figures from the Greek camp out of the sea mist.
The famous speech from Odysseus, persuading the Greeks not to follow
Thersites home, is stunning.
Thersites has raised the cry of 'Home' like sudden gusts darkening a lake;
Odysseus calms the soldiers and beats him with a cane before handing the
situation back to Agamemnon.
Howard makes it come alive, and for a moment, you are standing on the shores
of history by the wine-dark sea.
Cottesloe Theatre (071 928 2033) until 19 September, and 27-29 October.
Christopher Logue's Kings is published by Faber.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Hannibal-style habits / Consider the evidence of human
sacrifice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS HUMAN sacrifice a nasty habit or is it deeply rooted in tradition? The
truth is: a bit of both, and archaeology keeps finding new and startling
evidence of the practice where we least expect it. Recently I saw the latest
find, among the foundations of a new hotel at Amathus, near Limassol in
Cyprus. The Phoenicians of Lebanon probably introduced the practice: they
had a long history of human sacrifice, and were a power in Cyprus. But other
stories come to mind, from Greece, from Abraham and Isaac, and that of the
Lindow Man, a well-manicured, upper-class 25-year old who was hit on the
head, garroted and had his throat cut before he was placed in a marsh in
Cheshire as an offering to the Celtic water god. The custom of offering
young humans to a god as gifts is old and universal, but not frequent. It
was best to give one's own child, preferably a first-born male; if he was
not available, a daughter would do, or prisoners of war. In Greek stories
the habit is not common. It was seen as something reprehensible that created
blood pollution, but at times could not be avoided. The tragedians made good
use of it. When the gods deny the Greeks a fair wind to sail to Troy,
Agamemnon, their leader, has to sacrifice his daughter Iphigeneia. His wife
Clytemnestra is furious and has 10 years at home during the siege of Troy in
which to nurture her bitterness. When Agamemnon comes home she hurls snide
fury at him, encourages him into a hot bath and stabs him. The next step is
for their son Orestes to kill his mother, for which he is condemned to
wander in exile, until he reaches the Crimea where he is reunited with his
sister Iphigeneia, and the pollution ends.
It is difficult to find examples of human sacrifice from the 5th century BC
when the tragedians were writing about it. But 800 to 1,000 years earlier,
in the Bronze Age, it was certainly happening. Children were buried under
thresholds, presumably as an offering of first fruits for the prosperity of
house and home. At Knossos in Crete childrens' bones were found a few years
ago with butchery cuts as on animal bones. They are probably the left-overs
of cannibalism, perhaps a ritual to avert a disaster.
The leading sacrificers of the ancient world were the Phoenicians, who
traded throughout the Mediterranean and founded colonies in Sicily, Sardinia
and North Africa. At their settlement at Carthage in Tunisia - Rome's great
enemy - you can see the place of sacrifice, called a tophet, by the harbour.
Here thousands of vases were found, all of the same type, containing burnt
childrens' bones and animal or bird bones. Stones mark the sacrifices.
The victims were placed in the hands of a bronze statue, wrote Diodorus
Siculus, and then dropped into the flames. Relations were forbidden to weep,
perhaps because tears diminished the sacrifice or perhaps rather that they
were inappropriate when it led to a desirable end: the children's
deification. The young blood rejuvenated the god and bound him to the person
who had offered it.
But in 310 BC, after Agathocles of Syracuse defeated them, the Carthaginians
thought they had offended the gods by replacing nobles' children as victims
with children of low birth. When to make amends they decided to offer 200 of
the best, so many noble parents volunteered their young that they had 300 to
choose from. They also sacrificed prisoners of war, 3,000 of them after they
captured Himera in Sicily in 409, and continued these gruesome habits for
centuries, until the Romans defeated them and stopped the bloody business.
The newly-discovered tophet in Cyprus is on the Phoenicians' route to their
western settlements. Now cleared by archaeologists, it looked like a disused
rabbit warren when I saw it last month. Like Carthage, it is by the sea. A
slope runs up from the beach and vanishes beneath the concrete of what will
soon be bedrooms in the Four Seasons Hotel. Five hundred pots were found, as
at other tophets all of the same shape. Originally there would have been
many more.
Children, animals and birds burnt in tophets give poignancy to the story of
Abraham and Isaac.
When they reach the high place on the mountain, Isaac, carrying the wood for
his own pyre, asks: 'Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?'. And at the
last moment when Abraham has the knife in his hand, God stops him. He may
substitute a ram, a male sheep, caught in a nearby thicket.
The tale leads straight to the theology of the sacrifice of Jesus, God's
only son and also the lamb of God.
If you have booked into the hotel at Amathus and have a room on the beach,
sweet dreams, and sleep well.

   "Never forget -- we all sailed here with God," says a
Greek leader trying to pep up the spirits of the huge armada
beached at Asian Troy for 10 years to repossess Helen. He's
right: Troy is doomed.
   Homer's "Iliad" (c. 700 B.C.) tells of a few decisive but
not final incidents in this 10th year. As the epic opens with
its rousing invocation: "Rage-Goddess, sing the rage of
Peleus's son Achilles," the fierce ace of the Greek army is
leaving the fighting to sulk in his tent. It is Achilles's
tantrum that forms the epic's heart. When he returns, it is
to avenge the death of his friend, Patroclus, killed by
Hector, the noblest of the Trojans. Achilles's rampage
embroils in blood the very elements and highest gods, only to
subside in two astonishingly courteous ceremonies:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We read how a civil and amused Achilles presides over
Greek funeral athletics in Patroclus's honor. We read with
even more amazement of the meeting between Achilles and
Priam, the father of the murdered Hector, who begs him to
return his son's corpse: "I have endured what no one on earth
has ever done before  -- /I put to my lips the hands of the
man who killed my son." Gently, Achilles consents. He knows
that it is his turn to die next.
   It is the cruelest and the tenderest, the least humane and
the most profound of war stories. "War and Peace" alone has
the scope of the "Iliad," along with its frightening
altitude, as if told from a sheer height above a humanity
that is viewed, to use Eliot's words, as "some infinitely
gentle/infinitely suffering thing."
   Robert Fagles, chairman of comparative literature at
Princeton and distinguished translator of Aeschylus and
Sophocles, now has a go at this greatest of Greek poems
(introduction and notes by Bernard Knox, Viking, 683 pages,
$35). How does he do? Very well indeed. I noted with surprise
that Richmond Lattimore's "Iliad," the first good modern
Englishing, appeared as long ago as 1951. Lattimore stressed
the Greek's alienness and hieratic, formulaic stiffness as he
marched with unsmiling literalness and monotony in a
loose-fitting, six-beat, dactylic armor. Lattimore wrote: "I
put my lips to the hands of the man who has killed my
children." Notice how Mr. Fagles's words, which are in fact
closer to the Greek, have the rhythm of English verse.
   Between Lattimore and Mr. Fagles came Robert Fitzgerald,
who crucially returned to a five-beat, iambic meter, the
natural and native English beat. Mr. Fagles keeps the basic
five-beat iambic line but lets in air and space by often
expanding to six beats (like Alexander Pope before him) and
contracting to three. His verse units breathe and the
reader's eye is not confronted with 700 pages of lock-step
line-lengths.
   His happiest idiom is hard contemporary American: ". . .
look out/a heavy wave of ruin's about to break your neck."
"But night came in too soon. That's what saved them." "You've
only plunged him deeper in his pride." "My comrade's death
has cut me to the quick." "The gods are hard to handle --
/when they come blazing forth in their true power." ". . .
the wild mountain hawk, the quickest thing on wings."
   A lot of the "Iliad" is speech-war conferences, frontline
challenges and ripostes -- Mr. Fagles's purified
colloquialism is ideal here. And he does bloody action
clearly: ". . . ramming the spearhead square between his
teeth so hard/he hooked him by that spearhead over the
chariot-rail/hoisted, dragged the Trojan out as an angler
perched/on a jutting rock ledge drags some fish from the
sea."
   He offers simplicity ("the funeral fires sank low, the
flames died down"). He offers pathos ("the boy goes up to his
father's old companions,/tugging at one man's cloak,
another's tunic,/and some will pity him, true,/and one will
give him a little cup to drink,/enough to wet his lips, not
quench his thirst"). And provides simile's energy ("She
{Athena} put fresh strength in his back, spring in his
knees/and filled his heart with the horsefly's raw
daring-/brush it away from a man's flesh and back it
comes,/biting, attacking, crazed for sweet human blood").
   Compare Mr. Lattimore's unmusical "haul off the body and
give it to the dogs of Troy" with Mr. Fagles's "drag the
trunk away to glut the dogs of Troy." The dance of ds, rs, ts
and gs in the latter shows a poet at work, and at work in a
specifically English-language tradition.
   We can hear Milton in Mr. Fagles's "our great work lies
all before us, still to do," Keats in his "all your deathless
ease," Whitman in his "You are goddesses, you are there, you
know all things," and Shakespeare everywhere. And we also can
hear Ali in the words of the boxer Epeus, "I am the
greatest]" That's as accurate as and livelier than Mr.
Lattimore's "I claim I am the champion" or Mr. Fitzgerald's
"I'm best, I don't mind saying" -- neither of which sounds
like anything a boxer might conceivably utter.
   Pope remains the greatest translator (for one thing, he
can handle the divine comedy in Homer better than anyone
today), but Mr. Fagles can claim to be the 20th-century
champion.
   Hint to first-time readers: Read the "spine" books of the
narrative (1, 9, 16, 18, 22, 24) first; get an overall feel
for the big things; then go back and plunge in with a relaxed
sense of who are the stars and who the extras; play at being
a god.

   Troy Today: The Ruins Are Real, the Horse Isn't

   One hundred years after the death of Heinrich Schliemann,
another German archaeologist is leading an international team
of 50 archaeologists, scientists and historians in a new
campaign to answer the fascinating questions raised by
Schliemann at Troy. He became famous as the man who
discovered and excavated the Homeric cities of Troy and
Mycenae between 1870 and his death in December 1890, and
became the father of Aegean prehistoric archaeology.
   In this anniversary year, Prof. Manfred Korfmann of
Tubingen University in West Germany, who is 48 years old, as
was Schliemann when he started digging at Troy in 1870, has a
Turkish permit to excavate the many levels of habitation at
Troy that span nine major periods carbon-dated back to about
3000 B.C. This fabled fortress lies six hours southwest of
Istanbul by bus or car at the southern entrance to the
Dardanelles on the Aegean coast of northwest Turkey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under Mr. Korfmann's direction, German and Turkish
archaeologists are concentrating on Bronze Age remains of the
walled citadel of Troy from about 3000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.
(Troy I through VII). A team of American archaeologists led
by Stella Miller-Collett and Brian Rose of the University of
Cincinnati are digging outside the walls for remains of
classical and Hellenistic Greek reoccupation of Ilion from
about 700 B.C. to 85 B.C. (Troy VIII), and Roman imperial
rebuilding of Ilion from 85 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Troy IX). There
are also British, Austrian, Mexican and Danish scientists and
scholars working at Troy.
   In addition to the traditional archaeologists and ancient
historians, there are geologists and chemists core-drilling
in the plains and bays below Troy to map the ancient contours
of the coastline; there are geologists and physicists with
magnetometers mapping the streets and walls of the
unexcavated city outside the citadel of Troy; and there are
scientists using thermoluminescence to analyze the dates and
the chemical content of clay pottery, and the nature of food
or wine or oils stored in that pottery.
   There are paleozoologists studying bones found at Troy,
man and mammal; physical anthropologists studying human
skeletons; numismatists looking at coins; epigraphers
studying inscriptions; architectural historians drawing maps
of ancient buildings and streets; and computer experts trying
to organize all this new information in a computerized data
bank.
   I visited Troy just before the third year of current
excavations got under way in June. Mr. Korfmann, who got
hooked on archaeology during a postgraduate motorcycle tour
of the Middle East, enthusiastically explained some of the
old controversies he and his colleagues hope to find
archaeological evidence for or against.
   1. Is Homer's eighth century B.C. epic poem about a
10-year war between Mycenaean Greeks and Trojans a
magnificent myth, or is it based on historical events of the
Bronze Age 13th century B.C.? There is considerable
archaeological evidence for Mycenaean Greek activities and
some settlements on the Aegean coast of Turkey in the 15th to
13th centuries B.C., but no proof that the Trojan War of the
Iliad took place or ended with the destruction of Troy. The
exact date is even more elusive.
   2. Is Homer a historical person? Did he create the 24
books of the Iliad and the Odyssey himself, or collect and
recite stories told by traveling poets for 500 years before?
Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the essential historic
truth of Homer's story of the Greek siege and destruction of
Troy in the Iliad; and the founding of Rome by Aeneas, one of
the few surviving nobles of Troy, as told by Virgil in the
Aeneid. These stories were part of a classical education in
antiquity. In fifth century B.C. Greece and later in
antiquity, Homer was believed to be a blind Ionian poet,
perhaps from Smyrna or the Island of Chios, who composed the
story of the Iliad in about 730 B.C. and the Odyssey later,
around 700 B.C. Today, he is considered part of an oral
tradition of many poets reciting from memory the first great
epic of Western literature.
   3. Is the high mound of Hissarlik on the fertile plains
south of the modern Turkish town of Canakkale the site of the
"horserich," "windy" Troy described by Homer? Most scholars
think it must be Troy because it fits Homer's description
well and has so many stratified levels of habitation and
pottery. In antiquity Troy must have been 66 feet high from
bedrock -- "steepwalled" to be sure. This summer, the
German-Turkish team excavated two palatial buildings of Troy
II -- about 2500 B.C. -- built of two-foot-long mud bricks
and large square wooden beams. Atop the citadel of Troy, they
suggest this was an important power center more than 1,000
years before the Mycenaeans came from Greece.
   4. Where did the fabled 1,030 ships of the Greek fleet led
by Agamemnon of Mycenae land when they began the siege of
Troy, if they did what Homer tells us in the Iliad? Mr.
Korfmann's excavations from 1982 to 1987 around Besik Bay on
the Aegean coast southwest of Troy have convinced many
scholars that the Greek fleet would have drawn up its ships
on the flat, sandy beaches of what was in the 13th century
B.C. a much deeper bay, closer to the fortress of Troy, about
3.4 miles away. The previous assumption was that the Greek
fleet of the Iliad landed at the mouth of the Skamander River
directly north of Troy, inside the southeast entrance to the
Dardanelles in what was a bay with a river delta. Mr.
Korfmann argues persuasively that the strong five-knot
southward current of Black Sea water funneling through the
mouth of the Dardanelles near Troy, and the steady northwest
winds averaging 10 miles an hour down the straits of the
Dardanelles, would have made it very difficult for Mycenaean
Greek ships to sail up into the Dardanelles to the mouth of
the Skamander. They were fitted only with oars and sails and
had no deep keels needed to sail against the wind.
   5. How extensive were the streets, houses, shops and
temples of the Lower City outside the walls of Troy in the
13th century B.C., at the time of the Trojan War (the
so-called late Troy VI and VII)? How large was the new city
of Ilion, built and inhabited from the 12th to eighth
centuries B.C., through the Dark Ages to the Archaic Period
around 700 B.C. (Troy VIII)? And how much more prosperous did
Ilion become as a trading center and sacred site under the
patronage of Romans from 85 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Troy IX)?
   American classical archaeologists led by Ms.
Miller-Collett and Mr. Rose are exploring the fields south of
the citadel of Troy with magnetometric sounding and mapping,
and digging test trenches that are revealing a larger
settlement in later Greek and Roman times than was previously
suspected. This is breaking new ground, raising new questions
and hopes for answers to some of the riddles of Troy. This
summer, Ms. Miller-Collett cleared a sanctuary in the Lower
City with altars showing more religious activity and
continuous habitation from 1000 B.C. to the birth of Christ
than was previously imagined. Mr. Rose uncovered part of a
large Roman villa or glass factory of the fourth century A.D.
with painted walls, colored marble floors and a small marble
head of the god of health, Asclepius.
   Beyond the digging and publishing of their discoveries in
a new journal, Studia Troica, the Troy Commission of scholars
is making this celebrated site safe from tourist destruction
but also making it accessible to the 300,000 annual visitors.
New walking paths have been built through the site, and a
tourist information center with wall posters explaining the
history of Troy was opened to the public this summer.
Information signs throughout the site explain what you are
looking at each step of your way around the acropolis of
Troy. The biggest surprise for a first-time visitor to Troy
is a huge 60-foot-high dark wooden "Trojan Horse" at the
entrance, so big you can climb a ladder into the horse's
belly and imagine that you are Odysseus or one of his chosen
band waiting for the doomed defenders of Troy to drag your
horse into the citadel, where the Trojans were celebrating
false victory.

   New Paltz, N.Y. -- They are the denizens of ancient Greece
in the years following the death of Alexander the Great:
elegantly draped and coiffed women, a staid young soldier in
short tunic and thick-rimmed hat, a pair of young women
playing a jacks-like game of "knucklebones," two cherubic
boys gleefully staging a cockfight, a sagging old nurse
cradling her infant charge, a dancing dwarf.
   Meet these people -- or rather miniature clay depictions
of them -- in an exquisite exhibition mounted by the College
Art Gallery at the State University of New York campus here.
It's up until March 15, and then at Harvard's Arthur M.

   The 52 works in this small but ambitious show, titled "The
Coroplast's Art: Greek Terracottas of the Hellenistic World,"
show ancient Greece in a more intimate light than those
familiar monumental sculptures of Zeus and Aphrodite in
marble. The terracottas give us a glimpse of the life of the
common people -- their clothing, religious beliefs,
amusements, and even the diseases they fell prey to.
   During the Hellenistic period (323 B.C. to 31 B.C.), Greek
civilization dominated the Mediterranean basin north and
south. Trade boomed, as did royal and private patronage of
the arts. But the vastness of Alexander's empire, and then
its collapse after his death, "fostered a feeling of
smallness and inconsequence for individuals," curator Jaimee
P. Uhlenbrock writes in the introduction to the show's
catalog.
   Sculptors responded, she explains, by emphasizing everyday
human experiences and emotions, "in contrast to the
extraordinary behavior of gods and heroes." The resulting
figurines, from a few inches to a couple of feet in height,
became extremely popular. They were offered to the deities at
temples and in home sanctuaries and were placed in graves to
scare away evil spirits, pay tribute to a particular god or
maybe just to keep the deceased company on his or her trip
into the afterlife. They also may have been used for purely
decorative purposes in the home, says Ms. Uhlenbrock, an
associate professor of classical art and archaeology here.
She organized the show in honor of the 90th birthday of
Dorothy Burr Thompson, who pioneered the study of these
sculptures.
   The figurines were mass-produced by artists called
coroplasts, who were influenced by the talented bronze and
silver craftsmen and potters they worked alongside. To make a
figurine, the coroplast pressed moist clay into a pair of
molds, one for the front of the figurine, one for the back.
He used as many as 14 accessory molds depending on the
complexity of the statue. After the various pieces were
assembled, the statue was fired in a kiln, coated with gypsum
and painted.
   Variations in texture and clay color (cream to peach to
grayish brown) help pinpoint where the figurines were made.
The show focuses on six centers: Athens, Tanagra and Corinth
on the Greek mainland; Myrina and Smyrna on the coast of Asia
Minor (now Turkey); and Taras in southern Italy.
   The most well-known figurines are those in the Tanagra
style (which actually originated in Athens), heavily draped
women in serene standing or seated positions. Some can be
identified as women of means by their "melon" hairdo, a
series of twists or braids brought into a large bun at the
back of the head.
   Also typical of the Greek mainland are "personality
figures" -- dwarfs, aged nurses and contemplative old men.
Theatrical motifs were common as well: One statue of a boy
carrying a mask probably is a participant in a dramatic
festival in honor of the god Dionysus. Though the mask is
broken off at the bottom, we can still see that one eyebrow
is raised, the other relaxed. Ms. Uhlenbrock points out that
this was a common stage convention: The actor evinced a
particular mood by turning the appropriate side of the mask
toward the audience.
   Another delightful theatrical figurine from this region
shows an actor wearing the mask of a courtesan, so identified
by its flamelike "lampadion" (little torch) hairstyle. The
mouth of the mask is open and the tongue sticks out, possibly
indicating that this was a speaking part. A similar miniature
mask comes from Myrina, across the Aegean Sea in Asia Minor.
It was probably sold at souvenir stalls near the theater; a
large loop at the top would allow it to be worn as a pendant.
   In the figurines from Asia Minor, Ms. Uhlenbrock sees "a
culmination of fantasy and sensuality." Witness a beautiful
flying Nike from Myrina, circa 180 B.C. This winged goddess
of victory wears a transparent, high-belted gown, her right
breast and left leg exposed. She is attributed to ananonymous
crafts man known as the coroplast of the victories, and was
meant to be suspended from the ceiling. "Notice the delicacy
of the work," says Ms. Thompson. "The Greeks had a wonderful
sense of restraint. They didn't overdo. Every little detail
was thoughtfully and delicately worked out."
   Not only did the coroplasts of Myrina give us
less-inhibited depictions of the female body, their
counterparts in nearby Smyrna began to sculpt -- often with
amazing clinical accuracy -- images of the physically
deformed. Some scholars hypothesize such people may have
journeyed to a medical college at Smyrna for treatment, where
the coroplasts could have seen them in the streets begging or
performing. Ms. Uhlenbrock's favorite work falls in this cate

   The closest thing there is to a spiritual heir of St. Nicholas has no reindeer, no elves, doesn't live at the North Pole, doesn't climb down chimneys bearing gifts on Christmas Eve and doesn't say ho! ho! ho! 

   "Fine, fine, fine," says His Excellency Chrysostomos, the Metropolitan of the Holy See of Myra, when introduced to visitors outside the Santa Claus Church here. 
The bishop normally lives in Istanbul, which he would rather call Constantinople, where he helps run the Greek Orthodox Church. 
He has Santa's girth, but his red and gold vestment has no fur trim, and he doesn't wear a hat. 
With his neatly trimmed white goatee, he looks more like Col. Sanders than Santa Claus. 

   The bishop sweeps up the steps behind the makeshift altar table to a stone pedestal in the nave of the church, which except for this special occasion is now just a museum. 
A six-member Greek chorus chants. 
With a golden staff in his left hand, he conducts a two-hour liturgical service. 

   "You could say I am the apostolic successor to Nicholas," says the bishop of Myra, as he changes back into his black three-piece suit. 
"All of the Santa Claus stories, well, they all start from here." 

   But for the twists of history, Santa Claus might well speak Turkish, ride a camel, dress for the warm winter sun, bear gifts of oranges and tomatoes, and do his thing on Dec. 5, instead of Christmas Eve. 

   According to the story, Nicholas was a genuine historical figure -- the first bishop of Myra -- born in the now-vanished town of Patara. 
The remains of Myra, a well-preserved amphitheater, are about 60 miles west of Antalya on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. 
As the story goes, Nicholas was known far and wide for his piety and charity, and because Myra was a thriving port town, he was considered the protector of sailors. 

   Turkish scholars say he was killed around A.D. 245, and after his martyrdom, on Dec. 6, tales of his good deeds lived on. 
Miracles were attributed to his intercession, and he was eventually sainted. 
Greek scholars say that he lived still later; indeed, they say he attended the first Ecumenical Council in 325, where his advice on organizing the church was warmly received. 

   In any event, his fame was so great that when the Italian branch of the Catholic church in the 11th century began a drive to bring the remains of the most famous saints back to Italy, thieves stole most of Nicholas's bones from the church tomb here and took them to Bari, a town on the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy. 
The bones have lain there since 1087. 
From Bari, the cult of the patron saint of sailors spread north to other port towns. 

   When it got far enough north, Nicholas was abbreviated to Claus, and St. Nick became Santa. 
All the stuff about reindeer, elves and the toyshop at the North Pole was embroidered to fit local conditions and the exigencies of commerce. 
Santa Claus also came to be known as Father Christmas and, in Moslem Turkey, Noel Baba. 

   The gift-giving stories are strongest in Protestant countries, where saints aren't venerated. 
In Holland, Santa comes by boat from Spain on Dec. 5, in Germany by sleigh out of the snowy woods on Dec. 24. 
Northern European Catholics began giving gifts on Christmas Day to show thanks to God, church scholars say, but the tradition has been swamped by that of Santa Claus within the past few generations. 
Many Orthodox Greeks still exchange gifts on Jan. 1, the feast day of St. Basil; in Spain, gifts are given on Epiphany, Jan. 6, by the Three Wise Men. 

   The roots of the down-the-chimney story, popular in northern Europe and the U.S., may lie in one of the many tales told of the original St. Nicholas of Myra: 

   One day three maidens of Myra went to the bishop, saying that unless they could find dowries enabling them to marry, they would be sold into prostitution. 
The bishop, who came from a wealthy family, raised the money, and in the middle of the night threw a sack of gold through the open window of each one's house, to be found the next morning, thus saving the girls. 

   (This, incidentally, is said to be why the pawnbroker's symbol is three gold balls. 
St. Nicholas is not just the protector of sailors; he is also the patron of moneylenders, the patron of miners, the erstwhile patron saint of Russia, and the patron of thieves and lawyers.) 

   One thing that is known for sure is that virtually nothing is known for sure about the original Nicholas of Myra. 
There are no documents in which any such bishop is named and no records of the first Ecumenical Council. 
"He may or may not have existed," says Angela C. Hero, a professor of Byzantine history at Queens College in New York. 
Some scholars say that there definitely was a Nicholas who was a bishop of a town (not Myra) in Turkey but that he was never sainted. 

   This dearth of proof has led to any number of religious and historical spats. 
Many have been aired at the annual St. Nicholas Symposiums organized here for the past four years by the Greek Orthodox Church. 
The basic question: Was he or wasn't he? 

   "I'm absolutely certain that there was a bishop of Myra named Nicholas who was renowned for his charity," says Ernst Suttner, a professor of theology at the University of Vienna. 
"I can show you no proof, but for a cult and legend to have gone so deep into the world's consciousness, there must have been something at the start. 
From nothing, you get nothing." 

   Turkish scholars say that there was something here even before Nicholas. 
Enis Erdem Ece of Akdeniz University says the Nicholas legends grew from the myth of Apollo, who was also said to have been born in Patara and who was the protector of youth. 
Others say Nicholas was the Christian successor to Poseidon, god of the sea. 

   This is not pleasing to the Christians. 
"Nonsense," Prof. Suttner calls it. 
"You don't need old gods to explain Nicholas. 
Myra is on the sea, so he became associated with the sea." 

   Fahri Isik, a professor of archaeology at Erzurum Ataturk University, offers different proof. 
He says there had to have been a famous personality named Nicholas before the fifth century "because, all of a sudden, people started naming their children Nicholas." 
The Western names Nichols, Nicholson, Colson and Collins all derive from Nicholas of Myra, the professor adds. 

   Whatever the truth, today's tourist-conscious Turks have carefully preserved the Santa Claus Church here, and recently they erected in the gardens a statue of a hirsute, Western-style Santa (with a fur-trimmed suit and a sack over his shoulder) surrounded by children. 
The Noel Baba tea garden across the street caters to tourists all year long. 
The annual symposium this year attracted more than 200 people. 

   This year the Turks even granted the Greeks a major concession by allowing the religious Mass in the museum, the first time a Greek Orthodox Mass has been celebrated here since the 1922 "exchange of populations" between Greece and Turkey. 

   To the townspeople of nearby Demre, most of whom grow oranges, lemons or tomatoes, the veneration shown by these pilgrims is inexplicable. 
Only a few locals stare at the bearded clergymen and the busloads of tourists. 
Rifle-toting soldiers stand in the surrounding orange groves, protecting the visitors. 
In the middle of the service, the call to prayer from the mosque next door threatens to drown out the Greek chants. 

   To Bishop Chrysostomos, the heir of Nicholas, the melange of cultures and commerce is all to the good. 
"The message of Nicholas -- charity and love -- is universal," he tells the congregation. 
"Nicholas now belongs to the world."

A revised edition of Sir Paul Harvey's "Oxford Companion to Classical 
Literature," originally published in 1937, has long been overdue. The task of 
revision has been admirably carried out by Margaret Howatson in this second 
edition. The object aimed at is unchanged: to provide "a handbook of 
information for readers of the literatures of Greece and Rome, and of modern 
works which (touch) upon the classical world" (Howatson's preface). But to 
attain this object in 1989 requires taking account not only of the many new 
discoveries and reappraisals that have been made in the last half-century but 
also of the fact that the reader of today cannot be presumed to have the 
background of knowledge of the classical world that could be taken for granted 
in the reader of 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, in her revision of Harvey, Howatson not only has incorporated the 
archeological and other findings that have furthered and in some cases 
substantially altered our understanding of certain aspects of classical 
civilization, but also has added new articles and expanded others so as to make 
the book suitable "for any reader who is curious to find out about the 
classical world." All Greek and Latin quotations, which the reader of 1937 was 
expected to be able to read unassisted, are now accompanied by English 
translations. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the Oxford "Companions," this one is in dictionary format, consisting 
of alphabetically arranged articles of widely varying length and generality, 
some of them dealing with particular names and terms in a few lines, others 
taking up several pages to treat broad subjects such as philosophy, religion, 
and education. Each of the classical authors is the subject of an article under 
the name of that author that provides a general account of the author's works 
and his or her place in the literary and historical scene; important individual 
works are summarized and discussed in separate entries under the title of the 
work. Literary forms are covered under such headwords as epic, tragedy, comedy, 
historiography, oratory, and lyric poetry. The reader curious to know why the 
term classical often means "ancient Greek and Roman" (as in the title of this 
book) will find an explanation under "classic (classics, classical)." There are 
major articles on Athens and Rome, subdivided into sections on topography, 
history, administration, and economy. Sculpture, architecture, and painting are 
discussed under those words as well as in many related articles on particular 
artists, monuments, and genres (extensive cross-referencing helps the reader to 
find all that is relevant to the subject of interest). 
</P>
<P>
New articles added by Howatson include "astronomy," "Christianity in the Roman 
world," "gods" (dealing with the canonical 12 gods of the Greek pantheon), 
"homosexuality," "polis" (in which the meaning of Aristotle's statement that 
"man is a political animal" is explained), "postal service," and numerous 
others. Other articles have been substantially enlarged. The entries that 
summarize individual books, poems, and plays are still Harvey's (in the main), 
but in general very little has been left unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Companion" seems thoroughly up to date. Full account is taken of the 
decipherment in 1952 of the script known as Linear B and of the implications of 
that decipherment for our knowledge of early Greek civilization: Not only is 
there a new article "Linear A and B," but references to the decipherment have 
been added elsewhere as appropriate (in the articles on Crete, Greece, and 
Mycenae, among others). The "Riace Bronzes," two bronze statues recovered from 
the sea off Italy in 1972, are mentioned in "sculpture." The discovery of the 
tomb of Philip of Macedon at Vergina is discussed. Note is taken of the fact 
that Aeschylus' "The Suppliants," previously believed to be his earliest extant 
play, has been found to be of later date; the increasingly prevalent view that 
the "Prometheus Bound" is not by Aeschylus is referred to as well. A new entry 
is devoted to Menander's comedy "Dyscolus," which was found on papyri published 
in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate that a handbook to classical literature intended for the 
general reader should pay particular attention to matters that may be the 
subject of popular misconception. For example, the image of the priestess of 
the Delphic Oracle as delivering her prophecies while seated over a chasm from 
which "mephitic vapors" arose has a long history, but Howatson rightly notes 
that there is no good archeological or literary evidence for either the chasm 
or the vapors. She could have added that the notion that the Oracle's responses 
typically were equivocal or ambiguous (an idea so firmly rooted that among the 
senses of the English words Delphic and oracular listed in any dictionary one 
is likely to find something like obscure, ambiguous, enigmatic) is likewise not 
true of any of the Delphic pronouncements regarded as definitely authentic. 
Correcting Harvey, she explains that Pandora's Box was actually a large jar 
(pithos) and became a box only in later accounts through confusion with another 
story (Cupid and Psyche). As with Harvey, she makes it express that Cleopatra 
was Greek by descent, not "Oriental" or "African." 
</P>
<P>
One common misconception not adequately dealt with by Howatson concerns the god 
Apollo: She has retained unchanged Harvey's statement that Apollo was "the god 
of light, sometimes identified with the sun," but it has long been established 
that Apollo was not originally a light-god or a sun-god and that his 
identification with the sun was confined to the speculations of learned 
philosophers until the Hellenistic period at the earliest (Joseph Fontenrose 
has shown that not even in the words of Ovid and other Latin poets of his time 
is Apollo identified with the sun, as commonly supposed). Under "Paris, 
Judgment of," Howatson retains Harvey's view that the Judgment is not mentioned 
by Homer, but this view is based on the assumption that lines 25-30 of book 24 
of the Iliad are not genuine, an assumption not now generally shared (I owe 
this observation to Prof. Steven Lattimore of UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
The preface states that "some guidance is given in the headwords to their 
pronunciation in English," but the marking of vowel lengths is sporadic and 
sometimes erroneous (even allowing for differences between British and American 
usage). Those especially interested in the English pronunciation of classical 
names will find Catherine Avery's "New Century Classical Handbook" more useful 
for that purpose (out of print, but available in libraries). 
</P>
<P>
It should be remarked that Harvey's frequent citations of "interesting points 
of connexion between the classics and medieval and modern English literature" 
(Harvey's preface) have in this edition been substantially truncated or dropped 
altogether, evidently because of the need to make room for new material and 
presumably reflecting a judgment that today's reader is less likely than 
Harvey's was to be interested in references to classical allusions in Milton, 
Shakespeare, or Spenser. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the volume is a chronological table setting forth historical and 
literary events in parallel columns, and a set of maps of the classical world. 
This excellent new edition of an old standby can be highly recommended to 
anyone interested in classical civilization and its legacy.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Technology: Troubled oil on Europe's waters - Greek worries
over tanker building controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's shipowners have already had to accept tough new safety regulations
for tankers as the price of keeping access to the US oil transport market.
They are now worried that the UK or even the European Union may adopt
equally stringent measures to prevent disastrous oil spills.
Greek owners control 15 per cent of the world's oil tanker tonnage,
including a high proportion of very large and ultra large crude carriers
(VLCCs and ULCCs). The international tanker fleet amounts to fewer than
3,000 vessels, but its advancing age alarms environmental groups.
Sixty per cent of tankers are more than 15 years old, while most of the
VLCCs and ULCCS operated by Greek concerns were built in the mid-1970s.
The Greeks raise technical objections to the US Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of
1990, the law that could become a model for European legislators. Under its
provisions, all ships sailing in US waters and built after 1990 must have
double hulls, and shipowners face unlimited liability for accidents
involving gross negligence.
John Lyras of Granicos Shipping says: 'We have to live with the double hull
requirement. But the evidence is that it is of limited use in improving
safety, and it's costly.'
The US law resulted from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 which poured more
than 25m gallons of oil into Alaskan coastal waters. Many Greek owners
believe another disaster on the scale of the Braer wreck off Shetland or the
grounding of the Aegean Sea, a Greek-owned supertanker, off a Spanish port -
both earlier this year - would mean the introduction of the double hull
requirement in European waters.
The Union of Greek Shipowners argues that double hulls, with a cushion of
air between the inner and outer steel plating, can reduce oil leakages only
if a collision or grounding occurs at low speeds.
If two ships collide at normal cruising speed, the cargo tanks are likely to
be ruptured and the tanker is more likely to sink. Also, an explosion is
more likely aboard a double-hulled ship in an accident, as the gap is filled
with oxygen which reacts with vapour from escaping oil.
'The fact that the Aegean Sea had a double bottom made things worse. When
the ship grounded, oil got into the space in between and triggered an
explosion. Damage to the ship was more extensive and more oil was spilled
than if it had a single hull,' says George Banos of Moundreas Shipbrokers.
Fitting a double hull adds at least 15 per cent to the Dollars 120m (Pounds
80m) cost of building a supertanker, and cuts its carrying capacity by about
20 per cent.
Several large Greek oil carriers, among them the Onassis, Niarchos and
Livanos groups, have invested in double-hulled vessels. However, with the
shipping industry still in recession, there is little incentive for smaller
owners to switch.
The compromise solution advocated by the International Maritime Organisation
calls for tankers built after 1994 to have double bottoms and a series of
ballast tanks along the length of the cargo deck. But this would not
necessarily cut the risk of explosion as a fully-laden tanker would have air
in the ballast tanks.
As 80 per cent of tanker accidents are caused by human error, there is some
weight in the Greek owners' claims that higher standards of training for
both tanker crews and port officials would be as effective as shipbuilding
regulations.
Also, technologically advanced navigation assistance in congested
international waters could reduce the possibility for collisions and
groundings. 'What is needed is a shore-based electronic system, similar to
an air-traffic control system, that takes account of the limited ability of
a ship to manoeuvre in difficult weather,' Lyras says.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Echoes of Achilles haunt this ancient mystery: Kerin Hope
investigates the evidence for a murder most foul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANCIENT whodunnit has a special fascination, particularly when the gentle
scraping of an archaeologist's trowel unexpectedly reveals the murder
victim.
Nikos Stampolidis has been excavating an early Greek cemetery at Eleutherna,
in the western foothills of Mount Ida on the island of Crete: 'a site full
of surprises,' as he puts it. Not the least of these is a striking
connection between his grisly find and a famous burial ceremony conducted
outside Troy, the ancient city described in Homer's Iliad.
The city of Eleutherna, built in a splendid defensive position on a long
narrow hill cut off by a ravine on each side, flourished from the 11th
century BC until the Romans conquered Crete.
In the 1920s British archaeologists found several striking pieces of
sculpture of the archaic period. When the University of Crete resumed
excavations there in the mid-1980s, Doctor Stampolidis decided to dig on the
steep western slope.
He unearthed more statue fragments - some built into terracing for the olive
groves which now cover the hill - suggesting that Eleutherna was an
important centre of early Greek art. The leg of a finely carved 'kouros,' a
nude figure of a young man, dates from the 6th century BC. It is made of
local limestone, and would have stood almost six feet high.
Four small, delicately worked ivory heads of figurines, perhaps gods or
heroes, date from a century earlier. These were found in one of a
bewildering array of burials in the cemetery, which was used by generations
of city-dwellers from the 10th to the 6th century BC.
Children were often buried in pithoi: Ali Baba-style jars used for storing
oil or honey. Many adults ware cremated on funeral pyres built of neatly
stacked logs of pine or cypress. Nikos Stampolidis says: 'They wore their
best clothes and their jewellery; they were surrounded by offerings and
household goods. Afterwards the bones were collected and cleaned, then
preserved in a covered jar.'
Last summer, while cleaning the remains of one pyre, the excavators revealed
part of another, more extravagant cremation: 'a rich, important man, judging
from the bones of goats and cattle and and a pair of ox horns that were
found - all slaughtered for the burial.'
From one side of the pyre came a surprising find: a curving line of human
vertebrae. Beside it lay a whetstone, a perfume bottle and the neck of a
broken water jar. The leg bones were burned, and the skull was missing.
'Instead we found a double-edged iron knife, broken. It would have been
about 12 inches long.' Studies of the bones by Tina McGeorge, a British
expert, showed that the headless man was about 40 years old and powerfully
built. His spine was forced into an unnatural curve - apparently because his
arms were tightly bound behind his back, perhaps with a piece of wood thrust
in between, to pull back his head. His throat had been cut. 'The man was
killed in a kneeling position, and fell on to his right side. I think his
head was probably tossed on to the centre of the pyre.'
Was it an expiatory sacrifice, an execution, or a ritual revenge killing?
Stampolidis thinks the victim may have been a prisoner of war, executed at
the funeral of the man he killed. From the style of the perfume bottle, the
execution can be dated to about 725-700 BC.
This was the period, some five centuries after the probable date of the
Trojan war, when Homer's epic poems were written down. The execution remains
discovered on Crete vividly recall the scene in the Iliad where Achilles,
the Greek hero, buries his friend Patroclus on a huge funeral pyre, after
slitting the throats of 'twelve noble sons of great-hearted Trojans' in
revenge for his death.
The ritual of execution in early Greece was elaborate. A virgin brought
water in a jar to dampen the whetstone; the knife used to decapitate the
victim had to be broken and immediately discarded. If Patroclus' burial is
anything to go by, Nikos Stampolidis may find more human victims this summer
when he uncovers the rest of the pyre.
'Perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised to discover that some of Homer's
descriptions of the Trojan war were really drawn from contemporary Greek
life.'

   The most dangerous women in the ancient world
spent a fortune on perfume, and the vanity of at least one Biblical
king can be measured by the size of his bathtub.
   The lavishness of the ancients' royal boudoir and bath will be
on display starting Nov. 14 in an Israel Museum exhibition of a
1,000-piece collection of toiletries from ancient Israel.
   Blown-glass eyeliner kits, jewel-studded makeup palettes,
polished bronze mirrors, gold hairpins, faience cosmetic boxes.
   Among the collection is an ivory cosmetic spoon that once held
the eyeshadow of Queen Jezebel, the 9th century B.C. ruler who gave
makeup a bad name. There is also the only surviving juglet of
balsam, the favorite scent of the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra.
   ``Cosmetics in antiquity appealed at first to both men and
women. Over the centuries, cosmetics became more used by women,''
said Michal Dayagi-Mendes, curator of Biblical archaeology and
organizer of the exhibit.
   She said cosmetics were used as a means to color the faces of
gods to make them appear less cold and remote. Soon, priestly
attendants adopted the colorings and ultimately so did ordinary
people.
   In the hot, dry climate of the Middle East, cosmetics also
served a medicinal purpose.
   ``Wearing makeup repelled the little flies that caused
inflamation of the eyes. Also, eyeshadow took the place of
sunglasses, reducing the glare,'' she said.
   Like their modern counterparts, ancients squandered vast sums on
pampering themselves, indulging in cosmetic fads that sometimes
were silly and harmful.
   Ancient Egyptians used a reddish ochre makeup over the entire
face. Romans lightened their faces with a powder made from
crocodile excrement. Greek women used a finely ground lead to turn
their faces white and spent hours in the sun to bleach their hair.
   ``The Greeks were aware that the lead caused great damage, but
beauty was above everything else,'' Dayagi-Mendes said.
   Roman women went to great extremes to braid and curl their hair
and many wore wigs.
   But the greasy look was in, mainly because oil was used to
combat lice. The pests and more than 80 lice eggs were found, for
example, on a 2,000-year-old wooden comb recovered recently from
the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea.
   Nero's wife, Pompaea, was especially extravagant.
   ``Every day she took a bath in asses' milk. When she was finally
banished from Rome, she was allowed to take 50 asses with her just
to make sure she could have her daily milk bath,'' said
Dayagi-Mendes.
   Her bath did not survive, but that of Herod the Great was
retrieved a few years ago from his ruined Kypros winter palace near
Jericho. The 1{-ton, six-foot-long alabaster bathtub is a monument
to the grandiose style of one of the ancient world's great builders
and architect of the Second Jewish Temple.
   ``The man obviously had good taste and enjoyed all the
luxuries,'' she said, pointing to the regal tray where oils and
lotions once rested on the side of the tub.
   The costliest luxury in the ancient world, however, was perfume,
and ancient Israelites made the most famous variety, balsam, from a
now-extinct tree that once grew on the edges of the Dead Sea.
   To please Cleopatra, the Roman general Anthony acquired a whole
orchard of the precious balsam trees near Jericho so she would
always have a supply of her favorite fragrance, which cost twice as
much as silver.
   Calling it ``serpent's poison,'' sages of the Jewish Talmud
recount that the daughters of Jerusalem put balsam in their shoes
and, on seeing attractive young men, clicked their heels to release
the fragrance as a lure.
   Today, the only surviving balsam is a 1{-ounce flask covered in
palm matting that has lost all its allure. Only a musty, oily scent
remains in the padded box where it is kept.
   ``It must have been sweet, heavy and oily. It was their taste,
but you can't say more,'' said Dayagi-Mendes.
   To give museum goers a whiff of the past, Dayagi-Mendes has
enlisted the help of experts in Holland and Israel to recreate a
fragrance similar to the ones in Biblical times.
   ``I used all the plants mentioned in the Bible in connection
with perfumes and scented ointments,'' she said, adding that
ingredients included cinnamon, myrrh and frankincense.
   The result is Avishag, a perfume named after a consort of King
David. A two-ounce bottle is being marketed at the exhibition for
$50.
   ``We thought it would be intriguing to smell something of
antiquity, and this way you can take something home to remember
besides a brochure,'' she said.

   Talk about New World Order. In 27 B.C., Augustus, having
defeated Antony and Cleopatra and pacified much of the known
world, was busily consolidating the new Roman emperorship.
   This new Rome needed an arts policy to match its grand
self-image. Augustus, therefore, set up a virtual Imperial
Endowment for the Arts under the suave Etruscan magnate
Maecenas. It was Maecenas' luck to hire some of history's
greatest poets -- Virgil and Horace -- as enthusiastic
propagandists for the First Citizen. Virgil had already
celebrated Augustus as a restorer of peace and fertility to
the Italian countryside in "The Georgics." Now he had to
write the epic of Rome. "Epic" meant, since the Romans were
earnest followers of the Greeks, a long saga with gods and
battles. Just like Homer. He wrote "The Aeneid," a wonderful
new translation of which is recently out (Penguin Classics,
288 pages $6.95).

   This new Rome needed an arts policy to match its grand
self-image. Augustus, therefore, set up a virtual Imperial
Endowment for the Arts under the suave Etruscan magnate
Maecenas. It was Maecenas' luck to hire some of history's
greatest poets as enthusiastic propagandists for the First
Citizen -- Virgil and Horace. Virgil had already celebrated
Augustus as a restorer of peace and fertility to the Italian
countryside in "The Georgics." Now he had to write the epic
of Rome. "Epic" meant, since the Romans were earnest
followers of the Greeks, a long saga with gods and battles.
Just like Homer. He wrote "The Aeneid," a wonderful new
translation of which is recently out (Penguin Classics,
$5.95).
   Substantially complete, save for a few loose ends left
behind at Virgil's death in 19 B.C., "The Aeneid" is the
story of the Trojan Prince Aeneas escaping the Greek sack of
his town and bringing a Trojan remnant to Italy as the
nucleus of the future Rome. This was a new job for an epic --
to tell a high-minded national foundation myth in archaic
drag. Homer's heroes had not been concerned with any sweep of
imperial history: Odysseus, for example, had enough problems
getting back to his small island of Ithaca.
   But what turns out to give electricity and life and anger
and tension to "The Aeneid" is not dull, worthy Aeneas'
imperial crusade, but the victims he crushes under those
implacably rolling chariot wheels. In the poem's second half,
Aeneas embroils sundry unoffending indigenous Italians in a
messy war to make room for him and his band. But it is in the
poem's first half that he accomplishes his most notorious
mischief -- the destruction of Dido.
   Driven from her homeland in Phoenicia by a cruel
brother-in-law, the adventurous and creative Dido had led an
elite of her people to the barren North African shore and was
in the process of founding the bustling utopian city of
Carthage when, deflected by Venus (Aeneas' mother), she
rescued the shipwrecked Trojans and fell in love with their
chieftain.
   Soon she was forgetting about the blueprints for the
Senate House and concentrating on reading entrails instead:
"But priests, as we know, are ignorant. What use are prayers
and shrines to a passionate woman? The flame was eating the
soft marrow of her bones, and the wound lived under her
breast. Dido was on fire with love and wandered all over the
city in her misery and madness like a wounded deer . . ."
This romantic internalizing is a new note in Latin epic;
Virgil had been impressed by such Greek heroines of erotic
tragedy as Medea and Phaedra.
   Dido's reward for preferring private passion to public
glory was to see her lover sail away. But not before she gave
him a piece of her mind: "Look for your kingdom over the
waves . . . I shall follow you not in the flesh but in the
black fires of death . . . You will receive the punishment
you deserve and the news of it will reach me deep among the
dead." The mood music swells for the queen's last evening:
"It was night and weary living things were peacefully taking
their rest upon the earth . . . But not Dido . . . Her eyes
and mind would not accept the night."
   The queen rejects any notion of accompanying Aeneas and
regrets not having dealt differently with him at the start
("Could I not have taken him and torn him limb from limb and
scattered the pieces in the sea? . . . or served {Aeneas'
little son's} flesh at his father's table?") She decides on
suicide, leaving vengeance to some future Carthaginian (that
is, to Hannibal). The queen falls on her sword, and "All
warmth went out of Dido's body and her life passed into the
winds."
   David West's new prose translation proves two things about
"The Aeneid." The first we knew: It is the victims' poem.
They -- the Italians and young Trojans like Nisus and
Euryalus, and above all Dido -- steal the story from the
rigid Roman robots backed by head god Jupiter. Flesh beats
marble. Secondly, and surprisingly, prose can work superbly
to capture the sad, conflicted music of Virgil. Not
rollicking, whale-of-a-story prose, but sweet prose, clear
and clean and dancing like a mountain stream, as here.
   To gauge the nature and extent of Mr. West's triumph,
compare his version of Dido and the entrails with the 1956
Penguin prose of Jackson Knight: "But how pitifully weak is
the prescience of seers] There lay no help for her
infatuation in temples or in prayers." Compare it, too, with
the rapturously received 1983 verse translation of Robert
Fitzgerald: "Alas, what darkened minds have soothsayers]/
What good are shrines and vows to maddened lovers?" And here
is Mr. Fitzgerald's version of Dido haranguing Aeneas: "You
will pay for this,/Unconscionable] I shall hear] The news
will reach me/Even among the lowest of the dead." And here is
Fitzgerald on Dido dead: "Her body's warmth fell into
dissolution,/And out into the winds her life withdrew."
   Prescience? Infatuation? Soothsayers? Unconscionable?
Dissolution? Dry polysyllables settle on those translations
like chalk dust. It's language like theirs that has kept
potential readers from "the classics." Preferring simplicity
to archaic locutions, Mr. West remains closer to the Latin
sense and quietly achieves many an iambic beat more naturally
than Mr. Fitzgerald. He opens the window and the winds bring
life into Virgil's body.

   Money never made up for Christina Onassis'
rootless childhood or the loss of the father she idolized. It could
not ease the pain after three members of her family died within two
years, or save any of her four marriages.
   ``The sudden death of Christina Onassis closes a circle that has
all the makings of a Greek tragedy,'' the daily newspaper
Eleftherotypia said in an obituary. It spoke of the ``tragic fate''
of the Onassis family, which it described as ``a dynasty of death.''
   Christina was 37 when she died on Saturday during a visit to
friends in Buenos Aires. Friends and relatives said she was happy.
Newspapers suggested she had a romantic interest in the brother of
her hostess.
   An autopsy report gave the cause of death as acute pulmonary
edema, accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Family members discounted
the possibility of suicide.
   ``A happy person could never commit suicide and Christina was
content and very happy,'' said Mary Onassis, an aunt. ``Christina
was in the best part of her life.''
   Mario Falak, president of the Alvear Palace Hotel in Buenos
Aires, said: ``She reserved a suite through Dec. 4. She had so much
baggage our employees had to make two trips to the airport.''
   Ioannis Georgakis, vice-president of the Alexander Onassis Public
Benefit foundation, dismissed suicide reports that arose when
medicine bottles were found on Christina's bedside table.
   ``She had no health problems and it just seems her heart was too
tired to overcome the attack,'' he said.
   Greek newspapers quoted friends as saying the bottles probably
contained diet pills. Christina experienced wild swings in weight
throughout her life, often caused by alternating crash diets and
food binges.
   She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City and spent her
childhood shuttling from there to London, Paris, Monaco, Switzerland
and Greece.
   The three members of her immediate family died in only two years.
Christina's brother Alexander was killed in a plane crash in January
1973, her mother Athena died of a heart attack in October 1974 and
her father Aristotle died of bronchial pneumonia in March 1975.
   ``She could never escape the consequences of a rootless
upbringing,'' according to a ``Aristotle Onassis,'' a 1977 biography
of the Greek tycoon. ``Never an eager student, she learned dancing
under Margot Fonteyn and was educated at a series of expensive
finishing schools. ... She emerged a good linguist but with no sense
of place.''
   Its authors, five investigative reporters on the staff of London
Sunday Times, described Christina's relationship with her father as
``complex and self-contradictory.''
   Onassis women ``had to be satisfactory vehicles for
self-promotion and adoring females; and they had to simultaneously
accept his engulfing protectiveness and withstand his massive ego,''
the biographers wrote.
   Christina was 25 when her father died, and the event had an
enormous emotional impact. News reports said she spent the last two
weeks by his bedside and had to be sedated for more than two days
after his death.
   The biographers quote her as remarking that she found
relationships with men difficult ``because, how can I fall in love
when I have a father like mine?''
   Her love life was as turbulent as her father's.
   She married Joseph Bolker, a Los Angeles real estate broker, in
1971 and they were divorced nine months later. The second marriage,
to Greek shipping heir Alexandros Andreadis, lasted only until 1976.
   Husband number three, Soviet shipping executive Sergei Kauzov,
came on the scene in 1978 and departed two years later.
   Last was Theirry Roussel, a French pharmaceutical heir, in 1984.
Divorce proceedings followed eight months later. They have a
daughter, Athena, now 3.
   Aristotle Onassis married Athena Livanos, daughter of a wealthy
Greek shipowner, in 1946 and she bore him two children, Alexander in
1948 and Christina.
   They separated in 1960 after his highly publicized affair with
opera star Maria Callas.
   He married Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy in 1968 and Athena later
became the wife of his business rival, shipowner Stavros Niarchos,
who was married to Athena's sister, Eugenia, until her death in 1970.
   Reports at the time indicated Christina and her father's new wife
did not get along, and the relationship worsened after Aristotle
Onassis died.
   In April 1975, Christina ordered the personal belongings of
Jacqueline Onassis removed from Skorpios, the Ionian Sea island the
family had owned since 1963.
   ``The hate that developed between Christina and Jackie Onassis
determined her future,'' the newspaper Eleftherotypia said in its
obituary.
   Christina plunged into her father's business.
   ``For two years she sat behind a desk learning every phase'' of
it, Apostolos Zambelas, an aide, said in a 1983 interview.
   He said her business training had begun soon after Alexander was
killed.
   ``Alexander was being groomed as the natural heir, something
Christina sort of resented,'' Zambelas said. ``Eventually she got
more than she bargained for.''
   Her brother's death was a turning point in Christina's life.
   Eleftherotypia said in its obituary: ``They shared the same
distress over Jackie _ the widow, as she called her _ who
monopolized their father's attention.''
   Ta Nea, another Athens paper, said: ``Alexander's death left her
inconsolable. It was the moment she understood that her apathy was
over and that she would have to run the fortune.''
   Georgakis, the Onassis Foundation executive, said a board of
trustess will manage the fortune until Athena becomes of age.

<TEXT>
   A gunman shot and slightly wounded Premier
Turgut Ozal in the right hand as the leader addressed delegates at
his party's convention. At least 20 others were injured.
   The gunman was hit in the arm by return fire from Ozal's
bodyguards and then arrested. Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said
16 other people were wounded by gunfire and four were trampled in
the panic after the attack.
   Ozal's doctor, Cengiz Aslan, told reporters a bullet entered
through Ozal's right thumb and exited from the palm. The wound
required three stitches and the premier was in good condition, he
said.
   State television showed a picture of the gunmen at a hospital
and asked anyone who knew him to come forward and identify him to
police.
   The wounded include Labor Minister Imren Aykut, who suffered
scratches on her face, and one Motherland Party member of
Parliament, Beduk said. Two of the wounded required surgery but
were in satisfactory condition, he said.
   It was not immediately clear if the gunfire that hit some of the
wounded came from police or the gunman.
   A police official at the scene, who requested anonymity, said
the first bullet fired by the gunman hit the microphone in front of
Ozal and the second one hit his right thumb.
   Ozal took cover immediately behind the lectern when he heard the
shots, Anatolia said. Delegates and others inside the Ataturk
convention hall also took cover, it said.
   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at
him twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told the
agency.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli said the captured gunman gave
two different names to police and was insisting he acted alone. He
said the gunman first said his name was Hayati Ipek, then changed
this to Kartal, which means eagle in Turkish.
   Despite his injury, Ozal returned to the floor to continue his
speech.
   ``No one can take away the life given by God except God
himself,'' Ozal said.
   The delegates gave him a long standing ovation after this
statement.
   The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, but their
identities were not released.
   Later today, the delegates were expected to re-elect Ozal as
party chairman. There were no other candidates running against him.
   Ozal returned Wednesday from a historic three-day vist to
Greece, the first Turkish premier to visit its traditionally
hostile neighbor in 36 years.
   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emerged
from his talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but both
leaders said they wanted to continue their dialogue.
   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, including
the Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus.
   Cyprus has been divided into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot sectors since Turkey invaded in 1974 after an
Athens-inspired coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   In March 1987, Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean seabed.
   On Thursday, a court sentenced a Greek chemist to four months in
jail for throwing a tomato at Ozal's car on the last day of his
visit to Greece. The chemist said he was angry about Ozal's visit.
   In today's speech to the delegates, Ozal emphasized the
importance of political stability, saying the last decade, marred
by terrorism and an economic crisis, was a lost decade for Turkey.
   Ozal defended his record and recent economic austerity measures.
He said he was not interested in short-term designs and was looking
ahead to the year 2000.
   He was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The 61-year-old premier conceded that Turkey suffers from 75
percent inflation but pledged to halve the inflation rate within a
year.

<HEAD>Scholar Who Helped Unravel Dead Sea Scrolls Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. John Allegro, renowned for his work in
deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls but ridiculed for his theories
that Western religions were based on the worship of mushrooms, has
died. He was 65.
   Allegro died at his home on Feb. 17, his birthday, according to
death notices and obituaries published Monday. No cause of death
was given. He is to be cremated Tuesday.
   Allegro was a brilliant student of Semitic languages at
Manchester University and went on to study Hebrew dialects at
Oxford University.
   In 1953, he was named to an international team formed to
decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in caves at
Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea six years earlier.
   The scrolls, which spanned from about 100 B.C. to 70 A.D.,
included the oldest known manuscripts of books from the Old
Testament. Allegro's gift for deciphering minute texts was crucial.
His book, ``The Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was published in 1956 and
became a bestseller.
   Allegro's subsequent notoriety caused derision in the scientific
community but developed a cult following in the early 1970s.
Allegro, in his 1970 book ``The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,''
contended that Judaism and Christianity were in fact products of an
ancient sex-and-mushroom cult.
   He theorized that Jesus's last words on the cross were not a
lament to God but ``a paean of praise to the god of the mushroom.''
   Although trained for the Methodist ministry, he became a fervent
anti-Christian devoted to debunking the story of Jesus.
   Allegro also published a 1966 book, ``Search in the Desert,''
about an unsuccessful search for lost scrolls in the Judean Desert.
   He is survived by a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>New Rendering of Widely Used Bible Version Now Ready</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An interfaith team of Scripture experts led by a gentle-mannered
Princeton scholar has worked for 15 years producing what's likely
to become the most widely used Bible in American churches.
   The New Revised Standard Version, put out by six publishers in
various editions, is being distributed in May to bookstores. It has
been authorized and commended by most of the nation's major
denominations.
   ``It offers greater accuracy, clarity and naturalness of
expression,'' said the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger, chairman of the
30-member translation committee that turned out the new rendition.
   Drawing on older, more exact manuscripts and changes in meanings
of current English, the work is a fine-tuning of the Revised
Standard Version, completed in 1952, and the most broadly endorsed
version in the years since.
   Metzger, 76, a Presbyterian and courtly, zestful Scripture
scholar of Princeton Theological Seminary, applied this rule in the
new rendering of the ancient texts: ``As literal as possible, as
free as necessary.''
   That demanded that the content adhere to what the original
Hebrew and Greek manuscripts actually say, while phrasing it in
understandable and graceful English.
   ``We never tampered with meanings,'' Metzger said in an
interview. But many archaic usages and sometimes ambiguous or
obscure passages are clarified in the revised translation.
   For example, Zechariah 3:3, previously rendered as ``Now Joshua
was standing before the angel, clothed in filthy garments,''
becomes: ``Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood
before the angel.''
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also holds the copyright on the predecessor RSV,
endorsed by most major Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches.
   Despite the contemporary proliferation of Bible translations,
Metzger said the RSV has been the mostly widely used ``modern
speech translation.'' In its 38 years, it has sold more than 45
million copies.
   Revising of it was done by a translation committee of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars.
   Biblical scholars these days ``approach each other in terms of
scholarshilp,'' not denomination, Metzger said. ``There's a
homogeneity in biblical scholarship the likes of which we had not
seen before.
   ``The differences are in theology, not in biblical studies.
Irrespective of denominational affiliations, matters of theological
interpretation fall into the background. So far as the book goes,
we are essentially one.''
   Most teams producing Bible translations are paid for their work,
but the NRSV group labored at their task since 1974 without pay or
share in royalties. It's ``a contribution'' to the churches,
Metzger said.
   Formal publication date and church celebrations of it were
scheduled in September, but a May 1 start was authorized for
distribution to stores.
   While some feminists pressed for more sexually inclusive
language in the new translation, Metzger's criteria required
adherence to the texts. However, many terms previously rendered as
male were originally inclusive.
   He said that masculine pronouns or the words ``man'' or ``men''
often were used previously in passages in which the original text
allows for more generic usage such as ``one'' or ``people.''
   For example, Matthew 6:30 previously was rendered ``O men of
little faith,'' but now is rendered, ``you of little faith.''
Metzger said the word for man wasn't present in the original.
   Similarly, John 12:32 previously was rendered, ``And I when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.'' The latter
phrase now becomes, ``...draw all people to myself.''
   However, pronouns referring to God and Jesus remain masculine.
``We were not authorized to change them,'' Metzger said, adding
that there was no ``tampering with the gender of deity.
   ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the Son of God.''
   However, uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God are
changed to ``you.'' ``In the Hebrew and Greek texts the same form
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to God and
people,'' Metzger said.
   He calls the new translation both ``the newest and oldest
version'' since the translators used ancient texts only recently
discovered, such as the Dead Sea scrolls providing much older
manuscripts of the Old Testament.
   Some previously rendered passages that sometimes drew snickers
in church readings were changed to correct possible
misunderstandings.
   For instance, Psalm 50:9, that previously read, ``I will accept
no bull from your house,'' becomes, ``I will not accept a bull from
your house.'
   Also, Paul's letter in Second Corinthians ll:25 previously read,
``Once I was stoned.'' It now reads, ``Once I received a stoning.''
   Publishers distributing the NRSV are Cambridge University Press,
Thomas Nelson Publishers, Inc., Holman Bible Publishers, Oxford
University Press, World Bible Publishers, Inc., and Zondervan
Corporation.
   In addition, the American Bible Society has been authorized to
offer the NRSV as part of its program, and Collins Ltd., is
publishing an edition in Great Britain.

FT  06 OCT 94 / Arts: Less classical than sitcom: the RSC's 'Ion' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the classical Greeks, 'comedy' simply meant any play which ended more or
less harmoniously - without any high-born corpses or divine condemnations to
speak of. Actual humour didn't come into it. To stage such drama in the
present day is to walk a perilous line between the nature of the original
material and current expectations of the genre.
The two first-ever professional English-language productions of Euripides'
play opened this month. In a fortnight, the Actors Touring Company stages
Kenneth McLeish's translation in Cardiff prior to a national tour, but first
out of the traps is the director-translator partnership of Nicholas Wright
and David Lan for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Euripides' world view was far from clear cut: to him, morality shifted with
changing circumstances and the gods had their own agenda, to which men and
women were as flies to wanton boys.
One cannot help thinking that Wright and Lan's version of Ion would
perversely appeal to the old boy, founded as it is on the notion that
momentous events - a liaison between the god Apollo and a mortal woman,
leading to the foundation of virtually the entire Greek race - can be
recounted in the trite vocabulary of suburban sitcom.
Jude Law is cleverly cast as the temple servant of Apollo whose reunion with
his mother forms the narrative core of the play. This energetic young man is
not the stuff of legend: one minute he may be musing profoundly, 'if the
gods lie, how can we ever know the truth?', but the next - as a supplicant
to Apollo's oracle has just been misinformed that Ion is his son - he is
sending off over-enthusiastic and apparently suspect attentions with, 'you
wouldn't believe how often I have to put up with this . . . especially from
foreigners'.
As Ion gropes towards the truth of his parentage like a less-fraught
Oedipus, Law conveys the confusion and extremity of emotion without lapsing
into classical angst. He is supported in this tonal no-man's-land by Peter
Guinness as his stepfather Xuthus, an affable cove but not what you would
call blessed with diplomacy.
The women on stage are more unambiguously earnest, but sometimes seem a
little too far gone. When Creusa (Diana Hardcastle) plots the murder of Ion
before discovering that he is her own child, Wright and Lan fail to
integrate the scene's cut-price Medea-isms with the overall dramatic curve
of the play. Also awkward is the presentation of speeches by the
seven-strong chorus of Creusa's maidservants; after a promising beginning as
a kind of Women's Institute tour party, they fall into a habit of what can
best be described as synchronised writhing. Greek choruses are always a
devil to stage in modern productions; suffice it to say that this particular
option is less than triumphant.
However, the dominant note of the production remains its determined
anti-nobility. The gods and their doings are held up not to ridicule but to
chuckles of banal recognition, and Euripides' lines are rendered in a style
not unlike a kind of ancient Athenian Galton &amp; Simpson.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Diggers locate secrets of Xerxes' lost canal: Tales from the
earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
XERXES was the king of ancient Persia who took the long road to Greece in
480 BC to punish the Greeks for supporting rebels and, when he got there,
lost the battles of Salamis and Plataea. Rather more recently, there have
been full houses for a superlative production of Handel's opera Xerxes at
the London Coliseum.
Played poignantly as an arrogant and capricious despot, we find him
infatuated with a tree as the curtain goes up. Then he has the mad idea of
linking Asia and Europe by a bridge over the Hellespont (Dardanelles), but a
storm puts paid to this icon of folie de grandeur. Nor does he get the girl
he fancies. It is an old story of futile pride. But a state-of-the-art
archaeological project in Greece this past autumn shows it is not just a
story. Xerxes really was a man who did things on the grand scale. Sub-soil
radar has found the great canal he dug across Mt Athos to bring his navy
down safely to southern Greece.
Long buried and forgotten, Dr BJ Isserlin and an Anglo-Greek team of
scientists have located it again with the radar, which looks into the ground
from a sledge. It emits radio waves, like conventional radar, and measures
those that bounce back when they hit an interruption - a hard task, as all
there is to detect underground is the change between the fill and the sides
of Xerxes's canal.
The lack of buried structures stretched the new technique to its limits. But
it found the line in 3-D beneath 7-8 metres of hill slide, and has plotted
it for 2,200 metres without the expense of digging. Its length is exactly
what the Greek historian Herodotus gives: 12 stades (or furlongs).
Handel's picture follows Herodotus, who paints Xerxes as a wayward tyrant
with whom brave little Greece battled (and beat) despite overwhelming odds.
But even Greeks thought his monuments in Persia staggering. If you go to
Iran, do not miss the palaces of Xerxes and his father, Darius, at
Persepolis. Huge columned halls stand on a great podium. The sculptures show
28 subject nations from the Ionians (the Greeks on the Aegean coast of
Turkey) in the West to the Indians in the East carrying tribute in
procession to the king.
When Darius died in 486 BC, Xerxes inherited Persepolis - and problems in
the empire. The Ionians had revolted in 499 and Athens supported them.
Darius went to punish them but lost the battle of Marathon in 490. He had to
be avenged.
Preparations for Xerxes Greek campaign of 480 were stupendous. The army was
so vast that it could drink a river dry, Herodotus says, and Xerxes numbered
it by corralling 10,000 men into a tight pen, releasing them, and then
marching the rest into the pen in turn. That gave a total of 1.7m troops, an
exaggeration probably by nine or 10 times. Even so, it was a huge number.
The Hellespont is a mile wide and flows fast as the Black Sea joins the
Aegean. Although nothing survives, and Byron did not bump into any bits when
he swam across, the bridge was a superb idea. But Xerxes could not control
the weather (Handel gives full vent to the storm) and the first bridge
broke. He was so angry that he ordered his men to give the Hellespont 300
strokes of the lash, saying: 'O bitter water, our master lays this
punishment on you as you have wronged him though he has never done you
wrong.' The engineers were executed. The new ones tied two lines of ships
together, stretched cables between them, and laid a road on top. Xerxes sat
on a marble throne to watch the army cross. It took two days.
The Athos peninsula was the next obstacle. Earlier, the Persians had lost
ships sailing round it. So, Xerxes ordered the canal through its narrow
isthmus and put men to dig it under the lash, in the style of the river Kwai
railway. The Greeks thought the scheme odd, as they were used to
island-hopping across the Aegean. But the Persians liked to keep their land
and sea armies in touch in alien territories, for security and flexibility.
Although Herodotus described this marvel of ancient engineering in detail,
there was no archaeological exploration until Isserlin came. 'Up to now, the
search has been better than my wildest dreams,' he says, certain that there
is a big ditch underneath and not a haulage-way for ships as at ancient
Corinth. Eventually, he hopes to dig trenches to see how it was constructed,
but with the accumulated debris and soft ground there is a risk the sides
may cave in. He might, however, be able to solve his final problem: who were
the surveyors? Greeks coerced to work for the king? If he finds that the
canal's dimensions fit Greek measuring systems, the likely answer is 'yes'.
After Athos, Xerxes marched on down Greece, forced his way at Thermpoylae
(where 300 brave Spartans resisted to the last man) and destroyed the
temples on the Athens Acropolis and in the country around, while the Greeks
prepared to hold the isthmus of Corinth. But he lost his navy at Salamis,
and the army lost at Plataea the following year. Greece triumphed. In 464,
Xerxes was murdered in a palace intrigue.
If Herodotus came back today, he would be delighted that his account of the
canal stands up so well to modern science - and that Handel saw Xerxes the
same way he did.

   Former Sen. J. William Fulbright, a team of
philologists and a Soviet museum are among this year's recipients of
the Onassis awards, worth $100,000 each, it was announced today.
   American physicist Amory B. Lovins and British doctor Dame Cicely
Saunders also will receive awards, the Alexander S. Onassis Public
Benefit Foudation said.
   The prizes honor international contributions in scholarship,
human rights and the environment.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou will present the awards April 20 at a
ceremony in Athens.
   Fulbright, 84, of Arkansas, will receive the Athinai prize for
``his major contribution to education by establishing this century's
largest international study fellowship program of academic and
cultural exchanges,'' said the foundation's president, Professor
Yannis Georgakis.
   Leningrad's State Hermitage Museum, cited for its archaeological
excavations along the Black Sea coast, will receive the Olympia
prize for its contribution to culture.
   Dame Cicely, who in 1961 founded the London-based St.
Christopher's hospice for the terminally ill, will split the
Aristotelis prize for Man and Society with the Hellenic Spanish
Dictionary.
   ``We are honoring this dictionary for its important contribution
to the study and understanding of ancient Greek,'' said Georgakis.
   The Onassis prize for Man and His Environment goes to Lovins, 41,
for ``his notable contribution to the protection of the natural
environment by working towards alternative solutions to contemporary
energy problems,'' Georgakis said.
   In 1982 Lovins established the Colorado Rocky Mountain Institute,
which explores links between energy, water, agriculture and economic
development.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of Greek
shipping magnate Aristotle S. Onassis in honor of his son, who died
in a plane crash in 1973.

   Former U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright and
American physicist Amory B. Lovins were among those honored
Thursday with the annual Onassis prizes.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou gave out the awards, totaling
$400,000, at a ceremony in a packed chamber of the former
Parliament building.
   The Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation presents the
prizes to honor international contributions in scholarship, human
rights and the environment.
   The main award, the Athinai prize, went to Fulbright, 84, for
establishing this century's largest international fellowship
program of academic and cultural exchanges.
   ``In the words of your tutor at Oxford, you are `responsible for
the largest and most signifcant movement of scholars across the
face of the earth since the fall of Constantinople in 1453,''' John
Brademas, president of New York University told the Arkansas
Democrat as ministers, diplomats and local dignitaries looked on.
   Fulbright said he hoped the exchange progam he founded more than
40 years ago could play a role in ``enhancing mutual
understanding'' between countries.
   ``Through the international exchange program, I hope the young
people of the world will learn from one another ... if the outlook
for peace is as good as I think and pray it is, then these young
people will have the sort of world and future they are intended to
have,'' Fulbright said.
   Lovins, who in 1982 founded the Colorado Rocky Mountain
Institute that explores energy, water, agricultural security and
economic development, received the $100,000 Delphi Prize for Man
and His Environment.
   ``As Delphi is the navel of the ancient world, so energy is in a
sense the navel of modern society ... rediscovering our solar
rootstock, and grafting modern efficiency technologies onto it,
offers good news for all people and for the Earth,'' said Lovins,
41.
   Soviet professor Boris Piotrovsky, director of the
Leningrad-based Hermitage Museum, picked up the $100,000 Olympia
Prize for Man and Culture.
   The museum was honored for its discovery of several ancient
Greek cities along the Black Sea coast in its more than 150 years
of investigating the area.
   ``This award strengthens the bonds and cooperation that exist
between Soviet and Greek scientists involved in the history of the
ancient world,'' Piotrovsky said.
   The Aristotelis Prize for Man and Society went to both the
Hellenic Spanish Dictionary and Dame Cicely Saunders, who
established the London-based St. Christopher's Hospice for the
terminally ill in 1961.
   The Spanish Hellenic Dictionary was honored for its contribution
to the study and understanding of ancient Greek. Spanish professor
Francisco Rodriguez Adrados accepted the award.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of the
late Greek shipping magnate Aristotle S. Onassis in memory of his
only son, who was killed in a plane crash in 1973.
   Until November 1988, the philanthropic organization was headed
by Onassis' daughter, Christina. Ms. Onassis, 37, died Nov. 19 of
an apparent heart attack in Argentina.

   Greek shipping heiress Christina Onassis,
who died Saturday of a heart attack in Argentina, was a global
jet-setter worth an estimated $1 billion.
   The only daughter of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis,
Miss Onassis inherited his fortune _ and control of his two major
shipping companies, Springfield Shipping of New York City and
Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo, France _ after her father's death
in 1975.
   Miss Onassis, 37, led a stormy life that often captured newspaper
headlines. She was married four times and had one daughter, Athena,
named after her late mother and her father's first wife.
   Miss Onassis suffered a heart attack and died Saturday while
visiting a country club on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
where she was visiting a longtime friend, officials were quoted as
saying.
   Onassis' only other child, Alexander, died in a plane crash
earlier in 1975 before his father's death, leaving Christina as the
only heir to the family fortune, estimated at around $1 billion.
   Miss Onassis reportedly didn't get along with her step-mother,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who married her father in 1968. Mrs.
Kennedy Onassis' first husband, President John F. Kennedy, was
assassinated in 1963.
   After Onassis died in 1975, his daughter and other members of the
Onassis family reportedly offered Mrs. Kennedy Onassis a
multi-million dollar settlement to give up her rights to the Greek
magnate's estate, news reports at the time indicated.
   Ms. Onassis was stricken with a heart attack Saturday at 11 a.m.
(10 a.m. EST) at the Tortuguitas Country Club, about 30 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires, Dr. Hernan Bunge, a director of the
Clinica del Sol Hospital in the Argentine capital, was quoted as
saying.
   Miss Onassis arrived in Argentina approximately two weeks ago to
visit Marina Dodero, a long-time friend.
   She reportedly was stricken as she prepared to go swimming in a
pool at the country club home of Mrs. Dodero and her husband,
Alberto.
   Miss Onassis was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires.
   Miss Onassis also lived in Paris and St. Moritz, Switzerland. She
also owned the Greek island of Skorpios in the Ionean Sea, which she
inherited from her father. She also one time was toying with the
idea of buying the island of Corisco, located in the Atlantic Ocean
off the coast of central Africa, news reports indicated.
   She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City, and was first
married in 1971 to Los Angeles real estate broker Joseph Bolker. The
marriage ended in divorce nine months later.
   She later married Alexander Andreadis, the heir to another Greek
shipping fortune, but that marriage also ended in divorce in 1976.
   In 1978, she married a third time, in Moscow to Sergei Kauzov, a
Soviet shipping executive, but it lasted less than two years.
   In March 1984, Ms. Onassis married French businessman Thierry
Roussel in a civil service in the fashionable 7th district of Paris,
followed by a religious ceremony at a Greek Orthodox church.
   She told a French magazine at the time that she fell in love with
Roussel when she was 21 and they vacationed together on Skorpios,
the family island.
   Roussel's grandfather was the founder of a leading French
pharamaceutical company, Roussel-Uclaf, but it was sold by the
family more than 20 years ago.
   The couple had a daughter, Athena, in 1985 and she was baptized
in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on the private island of Skorpios. The
girl was immersed in a silver font specially made for the ceremony
and christened by Greek ship owner George Livanos, said news reports
at the time. The couple filed for divorce in about eight months
later.

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
Befogged Over the Aegean</HL>
<DD> 03/31/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> EUROP </IN>
<TEXT>
   Greece and Turkey have cooled their latest crisis over the Aegean Sea, but it's important to understand what transpired. 
Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou threatened to close NATO military bases in Greece to score a few points in an ancient feud and distract his fellow Greeks from his own economic and political mismanagement. 

   The Aegean is a permanent crisis rooted in history. 
After the Ottoman Empire collapsed after World War I, Kemal Ataturk founded Turkey as a modern secular state, along the way defeating Greek armies that had invaded to take some revenge for 400 years of Turkish rule. 
Ataturk helped forge a Solomonic settlement: The mainland will be Turkish, the islands will be Greek. 
After 1923, some 1.5 million Christians left Turkey for Greece and its islands, and some 800,000 Moslems left the islands for Turkey. 
This dramatic exchange of populations helped prevent the kind of tensions that remain in Cyprus, which was exempt from the 1923 settlement because of British rule. 

   The solution, though, leaves a geographical legacy: Some of the Greek islands are in sight of the Turkish coast. 
If each of the islands is granted a 12-mile territorial limit, the Aegean could be closed to Turkish shipping. 
Istanbul and the Bosporus would be landlocked. 
Naturally, Turkey considers the Aegean a vital interest. 
It refused, for example, to sign the Law of the Sea Treaty, which includes a loony continental-shelf theory that would give 97.5% of the shelf to Greece. 

   We somehow doubt that it was pure chance that this feud heated up just now. 
Mr. Papandreou kicked matters off by proposing to buy out a Canadian-led consortium that's been pumping oil off the Greek island of Thassos. 
In the process, it developed that the consortium planned to drill outside the six-mile limit, and Athens made loud noises about kicking over a 10-year-old understanding to preserve the status quo on developing the Aegean sea bed pending a demarcation agreement. 
Surely the prime minister understood that Turkey could not ignore this. 

   When the Turks reacted by cranking up the same old unarmed Sismik 1 exploration vessel that was involved in the original dispute in 1974, Mr. Papandreou put the Greek military on full alert, vowing to "teach the Turks a very hard lesson if they don't back down." 
He not only threatened American bases in Greece, but capped it all by having his foreign minister brief Warsaw Pact, not NATO, ambassadors and fly to Sofia to inform Bulgaria's Turkophobic president, Todor Zhivkov. 

   The media and politicians took the bait. 
A highly reputable international journal headlined: "Turkey Heats Up Dispute With Greece on Aegean Oil." 
British TV trapped Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, convalescing from heart surgery, and demanded to know if he was "willing to risk war" just to sail Sismik 1. 
Turkey, with the second-largest armed forces in NATO, has little to fear from much smaller Greece. 
Yet it was Mr. Ozal who defused the situation by offering to keep Sismik 1 in Turkish territorial waters as long as the Greeks refrained from drilling. 
Marking the end of the crisis, Greece's pro-government, pro-Moscow paper Ethnos ran the Orwellian headline: "Turks With Tails Between Legs." 

   So what was Mr. Papandreou up to? 
It's not hard to guess. 
The former Berkeley professor is pumping up anti-Turkish passions in the influential Greek emigrant community and with the left. 
After big losses for his party in municipal elections, he needs a distraction from the run-down Greek economy and his latest outrage, a plan to confiscate $1.2 billion worth of land from the Greek Orthodox Church. 
The "Turkish threat" is also handy just while the U.S. is deliberating the level of security assistance to Turkey and as Turkey is formally beginning its quest for full European Community membership. 

   This comes at a time, too, of increasing American respect for Mr. Ozal's Turkey, a nation he has transformed from a regulated, inward-looking economy into a free-market, free-trade nation, eager to live up to its security commitments. 
Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger have both been active in pressing the case for more aid to Turkey, which the Pentagon has labeled the "most important" NATO need for improvement. 
Congress, which has earmarked foreign aid for Israel and Egypt, has balked on Turkish aid because of pressure from the Greek lobby. 
It insists on the notorious 7-to-10 ratio, requiring $7 of aid to Greece for every $10 given to Turkey. 

   At some point Western opinion needs to cut through the Aegean fog and recognize that knee-jerk sniping at Turkey undercuts Western interests. 
Even more devoutly to be desired is that at some point the Greek electorate will outgrow these games, and stop letting anti-Turkish and antiU.S. rhetoric be used as an excuse for domestic misgovernment. 
Then perhaps Turks and Greeks can recognize that they share many interests in the Aegean and beyond.

<TEXT>
   Prehistoric American civilizations were not
built by transplanted Egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts,
says archaeologist Wilburn ``Sonny'' Cockrell of Florida State
University.
   The origin of the mound builders of North America and the
pyramid and city dwellers of Central and South America is explored
on ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' on public television
Wednesday night.
   ``A number of people, particularly in this century, have come to
an almost racist view of the American Indians,'' said Cockrell.
``They look at the high civilizations these ancient people built,
at their complex cultures and monumental achievements, and refuse
to accept that they were American aboriginals.
   ``Popular writers from the 18th century on looked at the mounds,
at the Anasazi pueblos in New Mexico, at the ruins of cities in
Central and South America and said they must have been built by
some vanished race. Later writers came up with the notion of
Egyptians and ancient astronauts.''
   Cockrell says the early Americans crossed a land bridge that
connected Asia and western North America in the Ice Age.
   ``Due to the mile-thick continental glaciers, the oceans were
300 feet lower, allowing these first immigrants to enter the New
World,'' Cockrell said in a telephone interview from Warm Mineral
Springs, Fla., where he is director for FSU's archaeological
research project.
   ``There were several waves of immigrants, and this show depicts
what scientists know about these people and their descendants. We
survey them over a wide geographic range and over a long temporal
range and look into questions as to why particular cultural
manifestations arose and why they disappeared.''
   The one-hour documentary is part of ``The Infinite Voyage''
series and will appear later on some commercial stations. The show
is a joint venture of PBS and the National Academy of Sciences and
was produced by WQED-TV in Pittsburgh.
   Cockrell is serving as spokesman for the show, although he
appears on the broadcast only in sequences about his project,
recovering the 12,000-year-old remains and artifacts of
Paleo-Indians from a sink hole.
   ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' will be followed in
subsequent weeks by reruns of four shows from last season.
   ``The celestial observations of the native Americans,
specifically Central Americans, were more sophisticated and had
greater accuracy than those of Western civilization,'' he said.
``Their understanding of astronomical events and the
interrelationship of celestial movements extends back at least one
millennium before the birth of Christ and probably earlier.
   ``They had the concept of the zero before Westerners. The
Post-Classic Mayans had libraries full of books called codices
which extensively documented Mayan culture. These libraries were
destroyed by the Spanish, who assumed that since these Indians
weren't Christian their ability to read and write was in conflict
with the Spanish concept of God.''
   The documentary ranges from the now-submerged land bridge
between Siberia and Alaska to the jungle-covered pyramids in
Central America. The trek of the first immigrants from Asia is
re-created by a group of Native Americans.
   The program then moves ahead to Warm Mineral Springs, where
Cockrell heads the archaeologists and paleontologists recovering
remains of the Paleo-Indians. Inland from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
another FSU group led by Dr. Glen Doran is shown excavating a
7,000-year-old cemetery from the Archaic period.
   ``The recovery of the skeleton of a 16-year-old male who
suffered from spina bifida indicates that the people were
compassionate and economically stable enough to care for a helpless
member of their group throughout his life,'' he said.
   The show then goes to Chaco Canyon, N.M., where National Park
Service archaeologists and their colleagues are looking into the
complex civilization of the vanished Anasazi culture.
   ``Archaeologists are careful to use the term culture,'' said
Cockrell. ``People don't vanish, but cultures vanish. People live
on but adopt or become participants in other cultures. It's rare
that an entire population vanishes, such as the concept of Atlantis
falling into the sea.
   ``The civilization of Atlantis did not vanish into the sea. The
myth refers to the dissolution of the culture of the Minoan Crete,
probably by the eruption of a volcano. The people remained to
become the inhabitants of the Greek islands and classical Greece.''
   Cockrell said non-profit educational institutions are encouraged
to videotape the show. The Digital Equipment Corp. has distributed
25,000 teaching guides to schools.

Bulgaria Planned"] 
  [Text] The construction of a Bulgarian-Greek oil pipeline 
from Burgas to the Aegean port of Alexandroupolis, an idea 
launched last month during the talks in Moscow between Greek 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, will neutralize Turkey's oil ambitions in the region. 
In addition, such a project will resolve the problem of 
transporting the Russian oil to Western Europe, the I 
KATHIMERINI Greek daily writes. 
  The oil pipeline, which will pass through southern Bulgaria, 
is also viewed as an opportunity to stop the expansionist 
strivings of Turkey in the region, in which 1.5 million Muslims 
live, and strengthen security in Thrace, I KATHIMERINI writes. 
  Athens views the idea of constructing a Greek-Bulgarian oil 
pipeline from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea as a counterpoint 
to the Turkish strategic plans aimed at establishing eventual 
control over the export of Russian oil. According to Athens, 
Turkey also aims at establishing control over the oil of the 
former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea. 
  By constructing the Greek-Bulgarian oil pipeline Russia 
would 
be able to free itself from its dependence on Turkey and 
simultaneously, the strategic positions of Greece and Bulgaria 
will be strengthened.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Days With NATO..." -- punctuation as published] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ministers, diplomats, and military officials, 
who are able to decide on peace or war, met in Istanbul 
yesterday. The foreign ministers of 16 NATO countries met in 
Ciragan Palace and held bilateral talks. Meanwhile, the 
ministers of 20 countries that signed the "NATO Program on 
Partnership for Peace" were transported from Ataturk Airport to 
the Ciragan Palace. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was rather tense when he met 
his Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias. The Turkish and Greek 
foreign ministers agreed in principle the last time they met 
that "the sides should refrain from making provocative 
statements to the press and try to create a favorable atmosphere 
to inspire confidence." 
  The continuing clamor in the Greek press and the aggressive 
statements made by the Greek politicians placed the Greek 
foreign minister in a difficult position until recently. 
However, it was Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's turn to find 
himself in a difficult position this time. One of the Turkish 
newspapers quoted Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on its first page 
a few days ago as saying: "I will order troops to land on the 
Aegean islands within 24 hours of an initiative by Greece to 
extend its territorial waters in the Aegean Sea to 12 miles." 
  That was not a new development. Ankara's stand on that 
matter was established many years before Tansu Ciller was 
elected to serve as Turkey's prime minister. Greece was well 
aware of Turkey's approach. However, had Ciller made another 
mistake without any reason, particularly when preparations were 
being made for the NATO summit in Istanbul and the meeting of 
the Turkish and Greek foreign ministers? No, Ciller made that 
statement some time ago on the condition that it should not be 
published. [passage omitted] 
  Of course, the Greek foreign minister was informed of 
Ciller's warning. Consequently, that state of affairs had a 
bearing on his talks with his Turkish counterpart. 
  Greece has 3,049 large and small islands in the Aegean Sea. 
The military status of those islands has been established by 
international agreements. The most important among them is the 
Lausanne Agreement and that which was signed after World War II 
for the "demilitarization of the Dodecanese Islands." A move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles will convert 
the Aegean Sea into a "Greek lake." Turkey disclosed in 1974 
that any attempt by Greece to extend its territorial waters 
would be regarded as a cause for war. Nevertheless, considering 
the Caracas Accord on the International Marine Law in 1982, the 
Greek officials have continued to reiterate their wish to extend 
their territorial waters. Greece, which has discovered oil 
close to Thasos in the northern part of the Aegean Sea, brings 
up the matter every summer and creates tension by arguing that 
it has the right to extend its territorial waters. In fact, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias informed Turkish and Greek 
correspondents yesterday that he had nothing to add to what 
Greece has said on the matter in the past. 
  However, a move by the Turkish newspapers and Turkish 
Government officials to act in a more responsible way would be 
very useful. Several high-ranking officials make statements to 
the correspondents on matters about which they have little or no 
information at all. That state of affairs has created unexpected 
problems in Turkey's foreign policy. Their statements are taken 
seriously by Russia, Greece, and other countries from time to 
time. However, our newspapers are only concerned with the 
number of papers they sell. So, they exaggerate developments and 
disclose statements that should not be made public. 
  The following proverb is in order at this point: "The 
suffering of the nightingale is due to its tongue."

<HL> Wall Street and the Age-Old Tragic Flaw
---
By John K. Clemons</HL>
<DD> 03/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)
SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN>
<TEXT>
   Second-guessing Wall Street's insider-trading scandal has become a growth industry. 
Politicians claim the whole thing could have been prevented by tougher regulations. 
Economists blame the system. 
"What do you expect," they ask, "when arbitragers' returns routinely reach 35% to 50%? 
Pussycats?" 

   Psychologists, too, are having a field day. 
They contend that the insatiable thirst for profit, the lavish life styles and the manipulation of the market are all products of (you guessed it) lousy childhoods. 

   Come on. 

   Things are simpler than that. 
It's plain arrogance that has given Wall Street its biggest jolt in decades. 
The symptoms are easy to detect precisely because they are so inherently a part of human nature -- the "we-are-so-powerful-we-can-do-anything" syndrome combined with the naive belief that once on a roll, always on a roll. 
It's an old story. 

   And it was told well by Sophocles, the fifth-century B.C. Greek playwright whose tragic characters illustrate the damage done by usurping authority, abusing power and lacking respect for others. 
Most important, they demonstrate that arrogance is downright bad business. 
Just change the names and places, and today's Levines, Boeskys and Siegels become the tragic protagonists in his stories. 

   Ajax, for example, is "top gun" among the Greeks in the Trojan War. 
In battle, he is likened to a lion, and enemy soldiers are understandably awed. 
Sophocles revealed Ajax's tragic flaw when Ajax is denied a promotion. 
The affront so rankles him that he seeks revenge by murdering the Greek leaders. 
But the gods intervene and turn him on the Greeks' livestock. 
After coming to his senses the next day, he is so overcome with shame that he kills himself. 

   Ajax's crime is not that he slaughtered a few goats and sheep or attempted revenge on his unappreciative bosses. 
His real offense is arrogance. 
Early in the play the youthful Ajax, leaving home to join the Greek army, is offered some parting advice by his father: "My son, seek victory in arms, but seek it always with the help of heaven." 
Ajax blusters, "Father, with the help of gods even a weak man might win, but I, even without their aid, trust to bring glory within my grasp." 
Youthful boasting? 
Perhaps. 
But when, as an adult, Ajax brags even to the gods that he is omnipotent, it is unpardonable. 

   To the ancient Greeks, there was nothing unusual about this. 
The idea that the gods would slap down any mortal who became too powerful, rich or ambitious was part of their culture. 
"The gods are accustomed to throw down whatever rises too high," said the Greek historian Herodotus. 
Words to Wall Street's wise. 

   Shakespeare's "Macbeth" is another story of arrogance, ambition and evil. 
As Thane of Glamis, Macbeth is the model young nobleman: brave and courageous, his king's most glorious general. 
But arrogance is to get the better of him: 

   I have no spur
   To prick the sides of my intent, but only 

   Vaulting ambition, which o'er leaps itself
   And falls on th' other -- . 

   When the king visits Macbeth's castle, Macbeth sneaks into his bedchamber and stabs him. 
Macbeth is crowned king, but he is consumed by guilt. 
Experiencing gradual disintegration, he utters the lines that signal the futility of his existence: 

   Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, 

   That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
   And then is heard no more. 
It is a tale 

   Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
   Signifying nothing. 

   Macbeth is finally beheaded by an avenging general. 

   Ajax and Macbeth dramatize clearly what's happening on Wall Street: unbridled arrogance and ambition leading to inevitable falls. 
Like Ivan Boesky's. 
His career began to self-destruct not when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of insider trading, but when, in 1985, he arrogantly told a crowd of adoring business students: "Greed is all right, by the way. 
I want you to know that. 
I think greed is healthy. 
You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." 
His is the all-too-common tale of a supersuccessful individual so contemptuous of others that he loses all sense of propriety. 
By the time he notices, it is too late. 

   Mr. Boesky -- whose prep-school education presumably included an introduction to Greek and Shakespearean tragedies -- may have been less surprised than others by his own downfall. 
Perhaps he remembered the line from Shakespeare's "Henry VIII": "Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition, by that sin fell the angels." 
And he knew that arrogance had infected him. 
Asked about his obsessive money making, he once said: "It's a sickness I have, in the face of which I am helpless." 
He had a premonition of the end. 
"I can't predict my demise," he told an interviewer, "but I suspect it will occur abruptly." 

   That's a tragic story. 
But the oldest in the world.

  [Text] Tirana, May 27 (ATA) -- [passage indistinct] as an 
independent country, whether to the liking of Greece or not, is 
determined to work intensively to develop friendship and 
cooperation relying on the principle of reciprocity with all the 
countries of the region, Europe and the world which share the 
same values. Albania is convinced that this is in its own 
interest, as well as in the interest of the Balkans and of 
Greece itself. But, one should say that other analysts think 
that making a global evaluation of the Greek policy in the 
region, the relations with Albania are only a segment of the 
policy of the Greek phobia towards neighbors or better it is the 
neighbour-phobia which dominates the Greek politics today. For 
this very reason, its neighbours in the region which expected by 
the Presidency of the European Union, that as states are 
directly bordered with the European Union to be assisted by 
Greece in order to be closer to this union and its 
opportunities, received the opposite of the assistance. 
  Thus, Greece established embargo against The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], while on the other way it blocked 
the EU assistance for Albania's salaries' fund. Wherefore 
Greece chose embargoes, blockades, grudges, and damnation to 
"contribute" to the stability of Balkans for the first six 
months of the 1994. Italy, NATO, and EU member, too, could not 
escape from the Greek anathema. It was the same way with 
Turkey, NATO member. Only Serbia has profited by the Greek 
Presidency in the region and may be the heavens and the seas 
which surround Greece until the Gods of Greece get angry with 
them.

<HL> Does 'Iliad' Lose A Little in Recital By an Accountant? --- Mr. Powelson Can Reel It Off In Greek, From Memory, But His Audiences Yawn </HL>
<AUTHOR> Lee Berton (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
      The wrath do thou sing, O goddess, of
   Peleus' son, Achilles . . . 

   So begins Homer's 15,693-line "Iliad." 
It would take all day, from rosy-fingered dawn to dark-browed night, to recite the entire epic of the siege of Troy -- just the thing, perhaps, to stave off boredom on a New York-Beijing flight or a Saturday night in the drunk tank. 

   If your muse isn't up to it, no matter. 
The bard of Les-Loges-en-Josas, France, Stephen Powelson, stands ready, able and more than merely willing to pour the first 14,300 lines into your ear, from memory -- and in classical Greek. 
Soon, he hopes, he will have committed the final 1,393 lines to memory. 

   Mr. Powelson, a 70-year-old accountant, lives in the Paris suburb of Les-Loges-en-Josas, near Versailles. 
He has returned to the U.S. at least 40 times in the past 10 years to do the "Iliad" thing, usually for not more than an hour or two, at schools and colleges. 
At these exhibitions of mnemonic prowess, a resident classicist randomly picks a line from the epic, and Mr. Powelson takes it from there. 

   Awesome. 
Says Mr. Powelson: "Everyone I meet can hardly wait to see if I can meet all these challenges." 

   But don't roll over, Homer, not just yet. 
As you might have put it, not all men reckon as sweeter than honey the words that escape the barrier of the many-languaged Mr. Powelson's teeth. 
To put it more bluntly, some people, including several classicists, say Mr. Powelson comes off as a crashing bore, ruining the poetry of the "Iliad" by reciting it in a relentless, mind-numbing, mile-a-minute monotone. 

   Gordon Kirkwood, a retired classics professor at Cornell University, describes a Powelson performance as "an amazing tour de force." 
But, he says, "It's something to admire from a distance rather than hear." 
Mr. Kirkwood, an authority on Greek life some 3,000 years ago, says that "the original rhapsodists who recited the 'Iliad' did it with a lot of emotion. 
Some might even weep or cry, and it was a very lively experience as contrasted with what Mr. Powelson does." 

   Alice Bennink, whose husband was a 1938 classmate of Mr. Powelson's at Harvard College, heard Mr. Powelson's recitation at a class reunion last June. 
"He's learned it by rote, so he rattles on very quickly and almost without any verbal or facial expression," Mrs. Bennink says. 
"I can't believe that the original bards of Greece narrated it like that." 

   Yet Mr. Powelson manages to keep the invitations coming. 
Z. Philip Ambrose, chairman of the classics department at the University of Vermont, says that "Steve Powelson is very singleminded, and he's a great promoter of himself." 
Mr. Powelson recited about an hour's worth of the "Iliad" from memory at the university in early 1987 before an audience of about 100. 

   "I'd heard about Powelson from another classicist at the University of Maryland, and then Powelson began to besiege me with letters asking for an invitation," Mr. Ambrose says. 
"Before he did the recitation, I thought I was going to be knocked out. 
But frankly, I found myself nodding at one of the greatest works of literature." 

   At dinner, Mr. Ambrose says, Mr. Powelson couldn't stop reciting the "Iliad." 
"It's an obsession with him," he says. 
"No matter what topic we brought up -- when I told him someone I know had broken a leg -- he would somehow relate it to the 'Iliad' and then begin his recitation all over again. 
I could hardly wait to get away." 

   Mr. Powelson says he isn't an "Iliad"-obsessed bore. 
"I participate in chess tournaments, play tennis and squash, and my favorite sport is water skiing," he says. 
"Why, I can even ski on one foot backwards." 
He does admit to running through the tale of the siege of Troy in fast-forward mode, "because that's the way I have to learn it. 
It's so long and filled with almost unending lists of proper names in some sections." 

   The "Iliad" has 24 books, totaling 600 pages. 
One section in Book II lists the names of 498 Greek ships and warriors in close order. 
Book XVIII contains 33 complex names of sea nymphs. 
When Mr. Powelson recites these names rapid-fire, he sounds like the late Danny Kaye reeling off the tongue-twisting names of 49 Russian composers in only 39 seconds in his novelty song "Tchaikovsky" in the 1941 Weill-Gershwin musical, "Lady in the Dark." 

   Various devices help Mr. Powelson retrieve long strings of names from his memory. 
"Three of the sea nymphs, for example, each has a name that involves water," he says. 
The syllable "cym" in Cymothoe means wave in classical Greek. 
"Actae" in Actaea means beach, and "limne" in Limnoreia means lake. 
Thinking of "a man with a fork of chrome who's an enemy" cues his recall of other names, Phorcys, Chromius and Enmemus. 

   Mr. Powelson began his bardship in 1977, when he was 60. 
Unemployed, with no job in sight, he decided to renew his interest in the classics and memorize the "Iliad" "as a mind exercise to keep me busy and from worrying about getting a job. 
For that sort of thing, my memory is good," he says. 

   At the age of 10, he says, he memorized in one week an entire year's homework in Sunday-school Bible studies. 
In prep school, he memorized the first 100 lines of the "Iliad," took three Greek courses in his senior year and won a national prize for his Greek. 
At Harvard, he studied Greek drama for only one semester and then had "nothing to do with Greek," he says, for 39 years. 

   Mr. Powelson eventually got the job he still holds, managing an office for an Arab businessman in Paris. 
Not long after, friends suggested that he go public with his feat of memory. 
"It sounded like a good idea," Mr. Powelson recalls. 
So he began soliciting appearances at colleges, prep schools and literary clubs in the U.S. and Europe. 
He has performed at the Universities of Arkansas, Colorado and Massachusetts and at Tulane University, among other places. 

   His wife of 47 years, Esther, says that Mr. Powelson is constantly mastering new lines. 
"When we go to lunch and we're waiting for the check or on a station platform waiting for a train, he pulls out his copy of the 'Iliad,'" she says. 
"Sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and leaves the bedroom to look up a word in classical Greek." 

   But, she says, "while my husband's memory is phenomenal, it is very selective. 
I still have to find his glasses and keys for him. 
He just doesn't remember where he puts them."

<TEXT>
   Merchant sailors who bobbed in 30-foot
seas after Hurricane Bertha splintered their cargo ship stepped
ashore with praise for their Soviet rescuers and acceptance of the
ocean's fury.
   Rolando Arellano, an apprentice officer from Manila,
Philippines, said Friday he would resume his oceangoing life and
vowed not to give in to fear. ``No _ this is life at sea,''
Arellano said.
   Twenty-one survivors of the wrecked freighter Corazon were
brought ashore by a Soviet fishing support ship that plucked them
from churning seas in the Atlantic about 400 miles east of New York.
   Six crew members, including most of the ship's officers, died in
the wreck Tuesday.
   ``What made the whole operation complicated was the wind and the
height of the waves, as well as the rainstorms, very little
visibility,'' said Capt. Vladimir Pushnoy, skipper of the Soviet
ship M-V Leonid Leonidov, speaking through an interpreter at a news
conference.
   One man spent about 10 hours in the water before he was hauled
to safety, Pushnoy said.
   The survivors were mostly Greek or Filipino sailors aboard the
593-foot freighter hauling tons of cement from Greece to New York.
   ``We are very lucky,'' said ship's cook Pantelis Potiris, of
Athens, Greece. ``It was very bad, very rough.''
   Arellano said he spent about five hours floating in the water
after his life raft capsized.
   ``I hope only to stay alive,'' Arellano said. ``I always pray to
God. We are thinking of our family and to save ourselves.''
   Many survivors had only life jackets for flotation, and the
yellow vests were hard to see amid the foam and spray of the rough
water, Pushnoy said.
   After the Corazon sent a distress signal Tuesday afternoon, the
U.S. and Canadian coast guards provided information to help the
Leonid Leonidov and several other ships find the survivors.
   Two other ships in the area got close to Corazon crew members
but couldn't get them aboard.
   Pushnoy said his ship was able to pull off the rescue because
his 46-member crew is used to working on the open sea and tying up
with other vessels under adverse conditions.
   Survivors from the Corazon hugged their rescuers after the rusty
Soviet ship pulled into port.
   ``The Russians are good,'' said one survivor, giving a thumbs-up
sign.

   The body of Greek shipping heiress
Christina Onassis arrived in Greece today from Argentina for burial
on her family's privately-owned island in the Ionian Sea.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died in Buenos Aires on Saturday of an apparent
heart attack, but the cause of death is still under investigation.
   Her body was flown to Athens on a chartered Olympic Airways
aircraft from Geneva after it arrived on a regular Swissair flight
from Buenos Aires.
   Olympic was founded in 1957 by her father, shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis, who then sold it to the Greek state in 1975.
   Accompanying the body were a group of relatives and Ms. Onassis'
fourth ex-husband, French multimillionaire Thierry Roussel.
   A memorial service will be held for Ms. Onassis on Friday in the
Greek Orthodox church of Aghia Fotini in the Athens suburb of Nea
Smyrni.
   Ms Onassis' body will be flown to northwest Greece early Saturday
and then put aboard a launch for the short trip to the island of
Skorpios, where she will be buried next to her father and her
brother, Alexander.
   Ms. Onassis inherited a fortune estimated at $500 million when
her father died in 1975. The remainder of his $1 billion fortune was
given to the philanthropic Public Benefit Foundation.

   An escaped convict shot and wounded
Premier Turgut Ozal on Saturday, police said, moments after Ozal
urged his country to reject violence. Twenty-one people, including
the gunman, were injured when police opened fire and the crowd
stampeded.
   Ozal, 61, was shot in the right hand and slightly wounded as he
gave the opening speech at the convention of his governing
Motherland Party.
   ``We have a more civilized atmosphere now. People of different
views can now talk to each other instead of fighting or drawing
their guns,'' Ozal said before the first shot struck the
microphone. A second bullet hit Ozal.
   Police fired at the assailant and hit him in the arm.
   Scores of people ran screaming as shots rang out. Sixteen
suffered bullet wounds, and four were bruised in the stampede.
   Prosecutor Cemal Ozer, who interviewed the gunman in a hospital,
identified him as Kartal Demirag, 32, and said he escaped from the
Mugla prison in western Turkey six months ago.
   Ankara governor Saffet Arikan Beduk said Demirag had just begun
serving a 10-year sentence for attempted murder when he fled the
low-security prison.
   Earlier, The Associated Press erroneously quoted Ozer as saying
Demirag was serving time for murder.
   Authorities had not established a motive for the attack, Ozer
said.
   Turkish news agencies reported responsibility claims from the
outlawed Kurdish Labor Party and another group called The
Revolutionary Officers Organization.
   None of the claims could be confirmed independently.
   The Kurdish Labor Party is fighting for an independent Marxist
state in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey. About one-fifth
of Turkey's 52 million people are ethnic Kurds.
   The assassination attempt occurred three days after Ozal
returned from a historic visit to Greece, Turkey's longtime enemy.
   Police said Demirag, a schoolteacher, stayed in a hotel near the
convention hall under the name of Hayati Ipek on Friday night.
Beduk said police were investigating Demirag's possible political
affiliations.
   Police took into custody about 50 people, many of whom helped
decorate the convention hall, to determine whether any smuggled
Demirag's weapon into the building, Turkish news agencies reported.
   Police and witnesses said Demirag was standing a few yards from
the lectern in a group of news photographers when he fired. Beduk
said Demirag's gun jammed after he shot twice at Ozal.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli, a physician, quickly wrapped
a white cloth around Ozal's wound.
   As blood seeped through the bandage, Ozal returned to the
lectern and declared, ``No one can take away the life given by God
except God himself!''
   The crowd jumped to its feet and applauded.
   Ozal ducked behind the lectern when he heard the shots, the
Anatolia news agency said.
   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at
him twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told the
agency.
   Ozal's doctor, Cengis Aslan, told reporters a bullet entered
Ozal's hand through the right thumb and exited from the palm.
   The premier received three stitches and returned to the
convention hall three hours after the 12:15 p.m. attack. Later,
delegates re-elected Ozal chairman of the party. There were no
other candidates.
   Ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The Motherland Party was founded six months before elections in
November 1983 that restored civilian rule in Turkey.
   In general elections seven months ago, Ozal's party received 290
of the seats in the 450-seat legislature.
   But in recent months, Ozal's popularity waned because of
inflation, which is running at 75 percent. Recent public opinion
polls have showed support for him at 25 percent, down from the 36
percent of votes he received in the elections.
   In his speech Saturday, Ozal defended austerity measures put in
place to battle inflation. He pledged to cut inflation in half
within a year.
   The attack on Ozal came minutes after he stressed the importance
of political stability. He said that the last 10 years _ in which
political terrorism claimed 5,000 lives and prompted military
intervention in 1980 _ were a lost decade for Turkey.
   Beduk said that of the 16 bystanders wounded by gunfire, two
required surgery but were in satisfactory condition. Police didn't
say if they were hit by police gunfire.
   Ozal returned to Turkey on Wednesday from a three-day visit to
Greece, the first by a Turkish premier in 36 years.
   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emerged
from the talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but both
leaders said they were resolved to continue the dialogue.
   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, including
the Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus. In March 1987, Greece and
Turkey came to the brink of war over oil-drilling rights in the
Aegean seabed.
   One of the first messages of regret about Saturday's attack came
from Papandreou. In a telegram, the Greek leader said, ``I hope you
will continue your government's creative work and the no-war course
we initiated in our countries' bilateral relations with new energy
and health.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who is to pay a state visit
to Turkey next month, expressed ``deep shock'' at the attempt on
Ozal's life.
   ``Your calmness and fortitude in continuing your speech to the
Motherland Party congress was admirable,'' Gandhi said in a
statement issued in New Delhi.

FT  16 AUG 94 / Whiff of Greek sewage at the yacht club: Pressure is growing
on Greece to smarten up its act on waste disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An onshore breeze carries a whiff of sewage to wrinkle the noses of
shipowners lounging at the yacht club on the Greek island of Andros.
Andros town, the capital, boasts a main street paved with marble and a
renowned modern art museum, but it lacks a waste treatment plant. Some
Andriot mansions have cesspits, but an estimated 80 per cent of the town's
waste pours straight into the Aegean Sea.
This does not amount to much in winter, when the population shrinks to
around 2,000. But summer is a different matter, with more than 15,000
visitors and expatriate Andriots packing the beaches at weekends.
'The outlets aren't close to places where people swim. But a municipality on
a wealthy island ought to have a sewage treatment plant,' says Mr Leonidas
Voulgaris, the mayor.
It was only after Andros was included in a European Union environmental
programme last year that plans for a sewage treatment plant were approved by
the government. The town council had already paid Dr100m (Pounds 274,000) to
lay a network of pipes. The EU will cover the Dr200m cost of building the
plant.
However, the project is now delayed by a 'not-in-our-backyard' protest by a
village close to the proposed site for the plant.
'It won't be an eyesore, and the outfall pipe goes 200m out to sea to dump
the waste 30 metres deep. But they're still raising objections,' says Mr
Voulgaris.
Andros's sewage disposal problems are typical both of islands and large
Greek cities. It has taken more than 10 years to build a sewage treatment
plant for Athens on the deserted islet of Psyttaleia in the Saronic Gulf,
together with an undersea pipeline to carry waste from the city. It is due
to start operating this autumn.
About 700,000 tons of industrial and household waste are dumped untreated
into the Saronic every year.
Another 20,000 tons yearly of oily slops from ships also end up there,
according to figures published by Anakiklosi, a Greek ecological group
acting as a consultant for the environment ministry.
'For three to five kilometres each side of the main outfall, the sea can't
sustain life and the seabed is covered with a thick layer of sludge
containing heavy metals,' says Mr Philip Kerkitsos, an environmental
scientist at the University of the Aegean. 'After the treatment facility
starts up, it will take 10-15 years for the Saronic to recover.'
For a country that relies on sun-and-sea tourism for much of its foreign
exchange income, Greece has been slow to develop an awareness of
environmental cost. Tourism earnings are projected at Dollars 6bn this year,
equal to the total forecast value of Greek exports.
However, attitudes are starting to change. The tourism ministry has launched
a campaign to check up on whether large hotels have switched on the waste
treatment plants they are required by law to install. Several hotels on
Corfu, which attracts more than 700,000 tourists yearly, have been fined for
pumping raw sewage into the sea.
A sizeable percentage of Greece's Ecu2.6bn (Pounds 2.04bn) share of the EU's
new Cohesion Fund is being set aside to build waste disposal plants. By the
end of the 1990s every town with more than 20,000 residents, together with
islands that attract tourists in large numbers, should have a sewage
treatment facility.
Yet even if foreign tourists have abandoned the Saronic, bypassing Athens to
fly direct to the islands, Greeks have few qualms about swimming in it.
About 1.5m Athenians - more than one-third of the city's residents - go to
local beaches every Sunday in July and August, according to an environment
ministry study.
The ministry is criticised by environmental groups for not carrying out
regular water quality tests on beaches near Athens and publicising the
results. On the other hand, ecologists appear to agree that away from
harbours, swimming in the Saronic is not generally hazardous to health.
Keeping the beaches free of litter is this summer's priority. Greece's only
manufacturer of beach-cleaning equipment is working round the clock under a
Dr150m environment ministry project to sweep 135km of beaches around Athens
and on nearby islands at least twice a week.
The company, Ram Europe, undertakes to pick up what ordinary rubbish
collectors leave behind, including cigarette stubs, peach stones and canned
drink stoppers. Mr Theodoros Redzos, general manager, says he worked out a
set of ecological criteria with the environment ministry so that 'plants
aren't disturbed, sand is not removed and the machines leave the shape of
the shoreline intact.'

AL MARTINEZ: A CITY IN SEARCH OF A PIT

<TEXT>
<P>
I have been searching for a consistent moral standard in L.A. by asking people 
how they feel about pornography. Two were for it, three against it and one said 
she wouldn't talk dirty with a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two for it, one was a television producer and the other an autistic 
savant who could name dirty movies back to the time Hedy Lamar appeared nude in 
the film "Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
The reason I went out searching for some kind of moral level was a ruling last 
week by Judge David Kenyon that there is no obvious community standard in L.A. 
regarding moral filth. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he threw out a case against a distributor of adult videos. How can 
you judge a film to be pornographic, he asked, when everyone has a different 
idea of what pornography is? 
</P>
<P>
Size has a lot to do with it. In Argonia, Kan., for instance, with its 
population of 591, it would be easy to set a standard by declaring that 
anything your mother wouldn't approve of is dirty, and those who don't agree 
with that get out. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, with its 13 million drifting souls, some of whose mothers 
are topless dancers, taste varies to such a degree that what is slime to some 
is chicken soup to others. 
</P>
<P>
One of those I spoke with in pursuit of a definition was the Rev. Jess Moody, 
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Van Nuys and God's best friend in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A wily Texan who has parlayed down-home charm and an Oxford education into 
leadership of 10,000 parishioners, Jess once claimed to have discussed with God 
the possibility of moving his church from Van Nuys to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
God said go for it, but the neighbors raised such hell that God changed his 
mind and said maybe you shouldn't go for it. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has talked to God, however, is worth listening to, so I asked Jess 
how he felt about moral filth. Asking a pastor how he feels about smut is like 
asking a cat how he feels about being chased by a dog. While the dog might 
consider it fun, it's not going to please the cat.

Jess came at me quoting the Bible, the Supreme Court, three teachers, a writer 
and his daddy to support his argument that Judge Kenyon should have set the 
community standard himself rather than leaving it up to the people.

"The man is a free-floating relativist," Moody declared with just enough fire 
and brimstone in his voice to indicate he was not fooling around. "He ought to 
be a ticket-taker at Dodger Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
I was about to ask what a relativist was, but you don't goad a preacher on the 
pulpit. Anyhow, he was beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what you get when you let people decide the law?" he demanded. "You 
get Jesus crucified and Plato forced to take Hemlock." 
</P>
<P>
He defined Californians as not being discriminating when it comes to 
pornography. Too many of us like it. 
</P>
<P>
"He who digs a pit will fall into it," Jess said quoting from the Book of 
Proverbs. Then he added cheerfully, "That ought to hold you for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to say anything to upset the ACLU and, God knows, I'd rather die 
than appear unhip, but there does seem to be a lot of hot sex going on and it 
isn't very subtle. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, for instance, a movie, to indicate human fornication, would 
portray a man and a woman in decent swimming attire kissing on a beach and then 
pan away to sea gulls when the breathing got heavy. 
</P>
<P>
Violins played while the sea gulls soared and sometime there was brass section 
fortissimo at the proper moment, but that was generally that. 
</P>
<P>
Now the camera dollies in for the kind of tight shots that would make a gunnery 
sergeant blush and follows the couple scene after scene as they repeat the 
performance on a roller coaster, a kitchen table, halfway up the steps of the 
Jefferson Memorial and in the middle of the Piazza San Pietro. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the R-rated stuff. Take the same scenes, add horses, whips, 
handcuffs and a guillotine and you've got what the porn kings are peddling on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kenyon and Jess Moody are both a little bit right. I agree that Mom may 
not be capable of setting a single moral standard for L.A., but it does seem to 
me we ought to be panning away to the sea gulls at least once in awhile.

  [Text] Ankara, Dec.11 (AA) -- Turkey is following the oil 
exploration activities of Greece in the open seas of Aegean 
island Thasos, very closely. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said today that waters 4-5 km west 
to the Thasos island are not among the disputed regions between 
the two countries. 
  The Greek Government had announced that it might carry out 
further drilling activities in the Aegean if the current 
explorations yield a positive result. 
  Turkey is closely following these activities so that they 
are 
not expanded to the disputed areas determined in the Bern 
Agreement of 1976 on the two countries' continental shelf. 
  Under the Bern Agreement both countries had ended their 
explorations in disputed waters of the Aegean. 
  Athens had filed a complaint before the International Court 
of Justice in the Hague and the U.N. Security Council against 
Turkey which began exploring oil in the Aegean, after Greece. 
  As Greece sought the approval of these bodies to declare the 
Aegean as a Greek sea, the International Court of Justice had, 
in 1976, called on for a Turkish-Greek dialogue to resolve the 
matter. 
  Turkish and Greek officials which came together in November 
1976 had taken conciliating steps in resolving the continental 
shelf matter. 
  The continental shelf issue was aggravated by the new PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government of Greece in 1981 
and Premier Andreas Papandreou has ended the talks.

<F P=106> [By Ayhan Songar from the "Chat" column: "Friendly </F>
Greece...."] 
  [Text] Yesterday, I discussed Greek claims over the Aegean 
continental shelf. Let us expand the issue now and move south. 
The Greeks are eyeing Cyprus with a hearty appetite and are 
waiting for the day they will get the entire island. The reason 
is that Cyprus is about 80 km away from our southern coast, 
while it is much further away from Greece. Now, if the Greeks 
get the entire island -- and that is what lies behind the plans 
for a so-called federation -- they will consider it a continent 
and thus lay claim to its continental shelf and territorial 
waters. As a result, Turkish ships will not be allowed in the 
sea traffic from the Canakkale Strait to Iskenderun Bay. This 
is the equivalent of strangling someone. 
  The Greeks would not be satisfied if we agreed to a 
federation in Cyprus, if we granted state status to the Fener 
Patriarchate, if we installed church bells in the St. Sophie 
Museum, and if we even gave them Istanbul and Izmir. Little by 
little, they are tightening the circle around us. On one side, 
they are establishing a close friendship with Syria and Egypt 
and trying to form another hostile front against us from the 
south; on the other hand, they are supporting the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] and trying to get their hands on our 
southeastern borders. Furthermore, they are trying to establish 
a partnership with the Slavic states such as the Russian 
Federation, Bulgaria, and the new Yugoslavia. These states have 
their eyes on us and have demands of their own from us. 
Therefore, they are more than willing to become partners in such 
a hostile front against us. This would leave Turkey totally 
surrounded by a ring of fire, and we would not be able to live 
on our land. 
  Please do not think that this is the script of an adventure 
film or an imaginary fear. It is just another one of the 
developments we have been repeatedly faced with throughout our 
history and from which we managed to extricate ourselves each 
time with God's help. It is not a new development. 
  I always say: Sooner or later, we will find ourselves in a 
confrontation with the Greeks. In fact, Greek foreign policy is 
based on enmity against Turkey and on war between Turkey and 
Greece. They are not afraid to repeat that incessantly. For 
now, they are coping with the issue through Cold War methods and 
diplomacy, because of the imbalance of power between us and 
because they have not yet solved their other foreign policy 
problems. For example, even if they share certain common 
aspects with Greece today, the Bulgarians have always had 
certain demands from that country. Let us not forget the 
incidents at the end of World War II. There is also the case of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
It is still a hot issue. The Greeks are afraid that if they 
ask FYROM "to unite against the common enemy," then FYROM will 
say: "Let us reach agreement on our own problem as well." 
  The imbalance of power between Turkey and Greece is obvious. 
Our population is 10 times greater than that of Greece. Greece 
cannot handle our ground forces. Furthermore, I do not think 
that Greece's big brothers in the West would do much more than 
say to it: "Good for you"; neither do I think they would run 
the risk of a new world war that would start in the Balkans. 
  Besides, from the legal point of view, we would be the right 
side in any Turkish-Greek confrontation. There are several 
logical reasons for that. It would be something like a 
"defensive war." 
  I hope my dear readers will not think that I am a warmonger. 
I am a peaceful person. When you are pushed against a wall, 
however, and people are trying to strangle you, there is nothing 
else you can do. 
  If that happens, how would the fact that both countries are 
NATO members affect the situation? Let us discuss this tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Lale Sariibrahimoglu report: "Problem of 12-Mile </F>
Territorial Waters in the Aegean Sea"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The disagreement between Turkey and Greece 
on Athens' intention to extend Greek territorial waters in the 
Aegean Sea to 12 miles has escalated as the time approaches for 
the Maritime Law Agreement to come into effect on 16 November. 
Greek Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said 
yesterday that Greece's approach to the matter has not changed. 
He also stressed that "extending the Greek territorial waters 
to 12 miles is a matter that concerns Greece's sovereign rights." 
  In a statement to CUMHURIYET, Greek diplomatic sources in 
Ankara have reiterated that extending Greek territorial waters 
to 12 miles is a matter of Greek sovereign rights. However, 
they also said: "Greece does not intend to extend its 
territorial waters to 12 miles." 
  Replying to a question about a press report yesterday, 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman has said that a move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles would be 
unacceptable. Meanwhile, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official informed CUMHURIYET that Turkey would regard a move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles in 
contravention of international agreements as an act of war. 
  Turkey has reservations about various provisions of the 
Maritime Law Agreement, particularly Article 3. The agreement 
was signed in 1982 and has so far been ratified by 60 countries. 
According to that article, the signatory countries are 
authorized to extend their territorial waters up to 12 miles.

  [Text] Greece is risking a war with Turkey by preparing to 
extend its territorial waters to 12 miles on 16 November. In 
accordance with a secret military plan Athens has drawn up, that 
country has already deployed 60 percent of its military forces 
against Turkey. 
  Greece's plan was finalized after aging Andreas Papandreou, 
who is known for his harsh statements against Turkey, came to 
power. Consequently, the Greek Armed Forces have completely 
changed their defense strategy. The Greek Government decided 
that Greece is confronted with a threat not from the former 
Soviet Union in the north, but from Turkey on the eastern side 
of the Aegean Sea. As such, many of the military units in 
northern Greece have been transferred to Western Thrace. The 
Greek defense line was also reestablished beginning on the 
western side of the Maritsa River and extending to the Greek 
islands in the Aegean Sea, which are very close to Turkey. Two 
infantry divisions on Bulgaria's border and two armored brigades 
and an infantry brigade have taken up positions along Turkey's 
border. 
  Furthermore, support units have been organized for the 
border 
between Turkey and Greece. Thessaloniki has been selected as 
their headquarters. According to the information we have 
received, they are made up of one infantry brigade, one armored 
brigade, one commando regiment, and one paratroop regiment. The 
units that will move into action in the Aegean Sea in the event 
of a war have been reinforced with a naval infantry brigade, a 
commando regiment, and a paratroop regiment. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Andreas Papandrou and his son, 
Yeoryios Papandreou, have been secretly working on a plan in the 
diplomatic field to involve the European Union in a possible war 
between Turkey and Greece. 
<H5>  Ataman: "No Concession on 12 Miles" </H5>
  One of YENI GUNAYDIN's correspondents has asked Turkish 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman to comment on a report 
we published a few days ago on Greece's warmongering 
initiatives. He said: "It seems that Greece has finalized its 
plan to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles." 
<H5>  Kilercioglu: "Greece is Making an Effort" </H5>
  Ahmet Dokulmez, one of the Prosperity Party members on the 
National Assembly Foreign Relations Committee, has warned that 
an effort is being made to place Turkey in a difficult position 
in international forums. Calling for measures to counter that 
eventuality, he said: "We are economically weak and in need of 
funds. Nevertheless, we have to adopt a hardline policy because 
that is the approach the Western countries understand." 
  Former Minister of State Orhan Kilercioglu reacted as 
follows: "That would be regarded as a cause for war. I do not 
believe that the Greeks will do anything so crazy. 
Nevertheless, preparations have to be made; we have to be 
prepared. Greece is making an effort in that direction."

Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For more than five months -- from the day of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last
Aug. 2 to mid-January this year -- prayers for peace in the Middle East went
up everySunday in most of the world's churches. Talk about saturation,
pinpoint praying. This was it.;    And yet war came.;    Under the
circumstances it would be understandable if people lost their faith in prayer,
if not in God. No doubt some did. But a headline in USA Today three days after
the war began said, "War gives religions a big boost.";    For one Catholic
worshiper in Chicago, war meant only a shift of emphasis in his prayers.
"Before the war I was praying for peace," he said. "Now I am praying for a
decisive victory.";    Why do people go on praying even after events show that
their prayers "didn't work"?;    "It's possible God knows something we don't
know," said one woman, unaware of the humor if not the mild blasphemy of her
remark. "There may be some reason why he didn't answer our prayers.";    Some
people have an easier time coping with suffering if they believe there is a
reason for it. What could be more comforting than to know that God has his own
good reasons for this war, though they may be hidden from us now? "Farther
along we'll know all about it," we are told in the song. "Farther along we'll
understand why.";    If that is your belief, unanswered prayer is not a
problem. Then there are those who believe in a God who is all-loving but not
all-powerful. They pray not to a God whose hand directs the course of human
affairs but to a God whose everlasting arms enfold all his creatures as a
loving parent comforts a dear child in all circumstances of life.;    These
people too go on praying through the worst of times.;    There are other
questions a war raises.;    How can we keep our sanity and our humanity in a
seemingly insane, inhuman world?;    "If we permit every threatening anxiety
and menacing tension in this war to invade our inner life,we shall ultimately
break down," says one clergyman. "We must deliberately limit our mental and
emotional load.";    Our round-the-clock concentration on the war news -- what
a psychiatrist calls "our CNN mania" -- can be our undoing as we go home from
work each evening to "watch the war.";    In the words of one sociologist,
"There is a dreadful fascination about war. It provides excitement and
vicarious danger to lives that are otherwise boring and humdrum until it
becomes 'showtime' for our latest technological military inventions.";    As
we become absorbed in the number of enemy planes shot down and enemy
installations destroyed, we are in danger of losing our feeling for the
sacredness of all life that makes us human.;    Edwin McNeill Poteat wrote a
moving poem in World War II about a widow whose son had enlisted in the Navy.;
   One evening as she stepped outside to get the evening paper from the porch,
her eye fell across the headline: "Round One in Fight in Coral Sea is Ours."; 
  At the same moment she saw a Western Union messenger coming up the walk. She
opened the envelope he handed her and read the message: "I have the duty to
report your son missing in action in the Coral Sea.";    Poteat wrote:;    She
did not weep but thanked the boy and then / Fumbled a moment with the News
again. / She did not see the line that mocked her plight / And said, "Our
losses relatively light."  </TEXT>

NORTHEAST SOVIET REGION TO GET ITS FIRST CHURCH

<P>
MAGADAN, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has never been a church in the entire Magadan region of the Soviet Far 
East, an area three times as big as California and with a population of 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
But now, a Russian Orthodox church is being built in the center of Magadan, a 
seaport on the Sea of Okhotsk that serves as the capital of the most 
Northeastern region of Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The church will stand next to a 60-foot-high memorial to the victims of 
Stalin's infamous prison camps. The memorial is scheduled to be completed by 
sculptor Ernst Neizvestny within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1930s the huge Magadan region remained virtually uninhabited except 
for nomadic reindeer herders and natives living in scattered villages along the 
coast of the Chukchi, East Siberian and Bering seas. 
</P>
<P>
Then Stalin started shipping hundreds of thousands of prisoners to the area. 
More than 100 camps of the Gulag system were erected and support communities 
were built around them. Everything in the region evolved around the prison 
camps from the 1930s through the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were an atheist nation there never was a reason to build churches 
here. It was the policy of our government to discourage belief in a god," 
explained Vyazheslav Kobets, the region's governor. "Of course, 
pre-revolutionary Russian Orthodox churches still stand in many places in the 
Soviet Union. But they were never here." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a great deal of curiosity about religion everywhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors are besieged by Soviet citizens, some of whom have been 
lifelong atheists, for any information they can get on their views of God. It 
is part of ane emerging phenomenon of people searching for something to believe 
in now that they have lost faith and confidence in the Communist Party and 
their government. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 members of a medical expedition to the Magadan region, sponsored by the 
University of Alaska's Institute of Circumpolar Health Studies, said Soviet 
doctors repeatedly asked them this summer if they believe in God and if they 
attend church. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the medical group included MDs, dentists, psychiatrists, hospital 
administrators, dental hygienists and physicians' assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"In one meeting when the subject of God was brought up, we asked the Soviet 
doctors what they believed in," said Anchorage psychiatrist Bill Richards, 49. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were brought up in the Communist system to be atheist and 
always taught not to believe in God, but to believe in the state rather than 
spiritual forces." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wandal Winn, 44, an Anchorage psychiatrist observed: "There is tremendous 
hunger in this country for ethics, morals and values to replace something they 
feel we have that they're missing. The Soviet people are in a vacuum, looking 
around for meaning in life. I have been asked by Soviet doctors if I had a 
Bible I could give them." 
</P>
<P>
Winn said he believes the Soviet Union "is fertile soil for fundamentalistic 
Christianity. I would not be surprised to see it coming on very strong."

<HEAD>Premier Ozal To Pay Historic Visit To Greece</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal will become the first
Turkish prime minister in 36 years to go to Greece when he flies
there Monday on a historic visit to improve ties between the
archrivals.
   His trip was viewed as unlikely to produce any breakthough in
major disputes dividing the two Aegean countries, but as one
high-level Turkish official remarked, ``The visit in itself is a
major achievement.''
   The last Turkish prime minister to go to Greece was Adnan
Menderes, later executed after a military coup. He paid a visit in
1952.
   For Ozal, 61, the trip is the realization of a goal declared
years ago. He said after coming to power in 1983 that he was
extending an olive branch to Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou and
was willing to meet him ``anywhere, any time.''
   He suggested that Turks and Greeks put off trying to solve major
conflicts and first establish a dialogue aimed at building
confidence, with cooperation in areas such as tourism.
   Ozal was the architect of Turkey's 1980 economic recovery
program, but was considered a novice in diplomacy at the start of
his term.
   The road to Athens opened when Papandreou, having rejected any
negotiations for seven years, pulled a surprise switch and agreed
to meet Ozal in Davos, Switzerland. At the meeting last January,
the two accepted a formula for improving relations founded
basically on Ozal's initial offer.
   The two NATO allies came to the brink of war in March 1987 over
oil exploration rights in the Aegean Sea, an event generally
believed to have given an impetus to dialogue.
   In Davos, Ozal and Papandreou declared their intention to avoid
war and decided to set up two committees, one political and the
other economic and technical, to start a process of negotiations.
   Since then the committees have each met once and Turkish Foreign
Minister Mesut Yilmaz has visited Athens, setting the stage for
Ozal's visit.
   In a memorandum the two sides pledged to reduce tensions in the
Aegean, cooperate in fighting terrorism and drug smuggling, and
refrain from provocative statements.
   Mayors of Athens and Istanbul exchanged visits. Greek Culture
Minister Melina Mercouri visited Turkey on a goodwill mission.
   Greek university presidents were invited and feted in Turkey,
and Turkish business people went to Athens to inquire about joint
ventures.
   Yet, the most intractable of their disputes _ over the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus _ still overshadows these modest
gains.
   Turkey boycotted a European Economic Community meeting in April
to protest the mention of the Cyprus problem in the opening
statement, a mention insisted upon by Greece, a full member of the
EEC.
   One key reason Ozal is out to improve ties with Greece is his
known desire to make Turkey a full member of the trading bloc by
the turn of the century.
   Many Turks still express apprehension about the Athens visit,
arguing that Ozal will come under pressure to make concessions on
Cyprus.
   Cyprus is divided into southern Greek and northern Turkish
sectors, where Turkish Cypriots declared independence in 1983. The
split came after Turkey invaded in 1974, prompted by an
Athens-backed coup on Cyprus.
   An estimated 20,000 Turkish troops guard the boundary dividing
Greek and Turkish Cyprus.
   Greek policy demands that these troops depart prior to a Cyprus
settlement. Turks say troop removal can only follow a settlement
which will protect equal political rights of Turkish Cypriots, one
fifth of Cyprus' total population of 750,000.
   In a recent interview with Turkish daily Milliyet, Ozal
declared, ``Not a single man can be withdrawn as long as there is
pressure on us.''
   He said he and Papandreou agreed to keep the Cyprus problem out
of the process of reconciliation, but conceded the issue will most
likely be raised ``privately'' in their talks.
   The other major problem, conflicting claims on the Aegean Sea,
is more complicated, but Turks hope that as a problem just between
themselves it can be more easily solved given time and good will.
   The Aegean sea is dotted by 3,000 Greek islands, many just a few
miles off Turkey. Turkey objects to militarization of the islands,
saying that is against international treaties.

Turkey could 'whip Greece' if the two Nato allies fight over rights in the
Aegean Sea, the Turkish foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, said on Turkish
television on Monday night. 'We don't want a reckoning. We know who will win
if there is one. We can whip Greece,' Mr Soysal said. He added that Turkey
was making military preparations but did not elaborate. 'If you want peace
you must be prepared for war,' he said quoting a Turkish saying. Greece
maintains it has a right to double its territorial waters to 12 nautical
miles but has no plans to do so. Turkey has said Greece's enforcement of a
12-mile limit would be reason for war. Many Greek islands are close to the
Turkish mainland and extension of Greek waters would effectively deny
Turkish boats access to the sea. The two countries backed down from the
brink of war over mineral rights in the Aegean Sea in 1987.
US assistant secretary of state John Shattuck yesterday voiced his 'greatly
heightened concern about the growing cycle of violence' in Turkey. During a
visit, he condemned the 'terror' of the Kurdish insurgency in the south-east
of the country but called on Turkey to seek a political, rather than
military, solution to the conflict.

<HEAD>Fight Goes on Over Turtle Devices for Shimp Nets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal requirement that shrimp fishermen
use devices aimed at helping preserve endangered sea turtles has
bitterly divided environmentalists and shrimpers who claim it will
ruin their industry.
   ``If this law isn't changed, it will mean that the entire
shrimping industry is out of business,'' Tee John Mialjevich,
president of Concerned Shrimpers, said Saturday.
   ``It's not that we don't want to save turtles, it's that we want
to feed our families,'' he said.
   Concerned Shrimpers, which Mialjevich said represents 2,000
shrimpers from North Carolina to Texas, was formed to fight the
turtle excluder devices, commonly called TEDs.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr held a rare telephone hearing
Friday afternoon after Louisiana Attorney General William Guste
asked for a temporary restraining order blocking the requirement.
Carr said he would rule Monday.
   Already, shrimp fishermen have won a 60-day reprieve from hefty
fines that were to go into effect Monday for boats that aren't
equipped with the TEDs, to free endangered sea turtles entangled in
their trawls.
   Last week, under congressional pressure not to strictly enforce
the special net requirements, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
said he was ordering the Coast Guard to issue only warnings through
June 30 _ instead of fines of up to $10,000 _ to violators along
the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.
   Environmentalists maintain that the TEDs will help save the
endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle from extinction, and
Mosbacher's decision drew criticism from a federal biologist.
   ``The shrimpers think that the sky's going to open up and God
will save them again,'' said Jack Woody, national sea turtle
coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``In this case,
God is the secretary of commerce. I'm totally frustrated at this
point.''
   Shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11,000 turtle
deaths estimated by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration each year.
   ``In 21 years of shrimping I've caught six Kemp's ridley sea
turtles and they all went right back into the water alive,''
Mialjevich said.
   ``I don't know of but about a dozen shrimpers that have TEDs,''
Ted Shepard, director of the 400 member Louisiana Shrimpers
Association, said Saturday. ``I don't think most of them will tow
them. They're having a hard enough time making a living now.''
   TEDs fit into the mouth of shrimp trawls and have trap doors
that let turtles escape.
   Fishermen maintain the devices are dangerous to pull and clog
easily, are expensive and reduce their harvests. The contention is
disputed by researchers who say fishermen who learn to use devices
correctly show no signs of loss. The ones based off Louisiana also
argue that the endangered turtles are not found in the waters where
they fish.
   ``This is an unbelievable horror story. There's just no way this
should be placed on the Gulf fishermen,'' Shepard said. ``You don't
get the Kemp's turtles in the areas we shrimp in. They're in the
Atlantic and off the coast of Florida.''
   Shrimpers have proposed alternatives, Mialjevich said, including
a $25 fee on shrimping licenses each year dedicated to hatching and
growing the turtles.
   The two-month delay in enforcement approved by Mosbacher comes
at the beginning of the sea turtle nesting season when thousands of
the seagoing creatures come ashore to dig their nests on sandy
beaches across the Southeast.
   Previous studies have shown that more than 11,000 sea turtles
drown in shrimp nets each year in the United States, incuding about
3,000 in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We don't need to wait for another study to find out if they're
endangered,'' Woody said. ``They can call me and I'll tell them for
free. I've been putting little turtles in the ocean for 12 years
and watching them disappear.''

<HEAD>Historic Turkish Wreck Located Off Greek Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath
the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden
Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822.
   The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the
island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical
accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter
Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
   The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set
afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for
Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
   Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked
other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek
struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece won
independence in 1830.
   The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture,
``The Massacre of Chios,'' based on the raids.
   ``It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book
we used to read in school about the War of Independence,''
Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.
   Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an
underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started
querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed
obstacles.
   He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said.
   ``When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy
seabed and dozens of objects _ Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls,
a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church,'' he
said.
   ``The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios. I think
there may be gold and silver items as well,'' he said. ``I also saw
what I recognized as human bones,'' he added.
   He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet
in length.
   According to historians, more than 1,000 people _ including 400
Greek captives _ were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his
attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822.
   The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing
a boat stuffed with explosives. Its pointed bow was rammed into the
mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit.
   The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed in the blast
that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped.
   ``This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from
this particular period of history,'' said George
Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine
archaeology.
   Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site
will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology
rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, ``This is
a ship that must be explored.''
   Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American
and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international
project.
   American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at
Texas A &amp; M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers,
have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast.
   Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying
historic wrecks scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out
excavations.

   On a clear day in Crete, the myth of
Daedalus and the reality of Kanellos Kanellopoulos drew uncannily
close.
   Daedulus was a mythical Greek hero who built wings from wax and
feathers and flew across the Aegean Sea. His son, Icarus, tried to
soar to the sun and fell into the sea.
   Kanellopoulos is a real Greek hero, a champion bicyclist who
likes to draw pictures of birds. On April 23, flying a fragile
airplane powered by pedals pushed by his powerful legs, he
duplicated Daedalus' feat.
   He flew farther than anyone else in a human-powered plane. But,
like Icarus, he has his sights on a goal he considers much loftier
than flying from one place to another.
   Two days after his feat, the tall, laconic Greek was training
for the Olympics in Seoul.
   ``It's true (the flight) was something different, but what I've
really wanted all along is to win a place for the Olympics,'' he
said.
   ``I was just lucky ... lucky to have my turn as pilot that day,
and lucky to accomplish the flight.''
   Kanellopoulos, a Greek cycling champion for 14 years and a
specialist in endurance events, has a reputation for coolness that
showed at the end of the 74-mile flight from Crete to Santorini.
   When the plane _ the Daedalus 88 _ crashed in the sea just 10
yards offshore, he stayed calm.
   ``I knew the job was done, so I unhooked my pedal clips and just
walked through the wreckage to the beach,'' he said.
   The 72-pound aircraft, built of hi-tech fiber compounds and
ultra-thin plastic sheeting, collapsed on impact.
   Kanellopoulos' flight took just three hours, 54 minutes at an
average speed of 18{ mph. It broke the record of 37.2 miles for
human-powered flight, set in January 1987 by Glenn Tremml, who
powered a Daedalus 88 prototype around Edward Air Force Base in
California. It also broke Bryan Allen's 1979 straight-line record
of 22{ miles across the English Channel.
   ``Kanellos is a really good athlete. By the end of the flight he
had his heart rate way down and he could have gone almost double
the distance,'' said Steve K. Bussolari, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology expert on human aerospace factors who headed flight
operations for the project.
   Kanellopoulos, who turned 31 two days after the flight, joined a
group of four American athlete-pilots in the United States last
year on the final six-month training period for the MIT project.
   ``He was exactly the right kind of athlete, a long-duration
cyclist who could produce a lot of power for his weight, and I
judged he had the temperament for a project that took patience,''
Bussolari said.
   For Kanellopoulos, human-powered flying was a challenge that
could be combined with his Olympic preparations.
   ``Learning to fly wasn't hard. And the training program wasn't
so different from what I was planning to do in Greece,'' he said.
   The other pilots described Kanellopoulos as a dedicated athlete
who quickly learned to handle the delicate Daedalus prototypes,
despite his 6-foot-2, 158-pound frame.
   ``Kanellos speaks good English and he learned real fast. He's
the biggest and strongest of us, and he sometimes had to ease off
the power so he didn't break the plane,'' said Tremml, 27, from New
Haven, Conn., one of the plane's pilots.
   ``Kanellos likes to play the cool tough guy, but I could see how
his knees were trembling when he was sitting in the plane waiting
to take off,'' Tremml added.
   In Athens, Kanellopoulos, a high-school physical education
teacher who works for the government sports secretariat, lives in a
small apartment at the Athens Olympic Stadium village.
   The Daedalus flight is unlikely to add to his renown.
   His gold medals at two successive Mediterranean Games were a
rare achievement for this small nation, which doesn't have the
resources to produce world-class sportsmen, despite its ancient
athletic tradition.
   Like many modern Greeks, Kanellopoulos takes the ancient glories
for granted.
   ``I first learned the Daedalus legend as a kid at school, but
then we're born with ancient ruins and mythology and we live with
them all the time, so they don't give us such strong feelings, ''
he said.

   BANIYAS, Israeli-annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ U.S. and Israeli
archaeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its heyday
was the ancient world's equivalent of New York.
   Founded in about A.D. 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the
Great, ancient Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years
``into a huge city,'' archaeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the
Israel Antiquities Department recently said.
   ``We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000
people, which for those days means it was a New York,'' Tzarferis
said.
   Traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center,
he said.
   Herod Philip chose the site near the source waters of the Jordan
River and next to a cave where pagans worshiped Pan, the goat-like
god of the shepherds. The cave is part of a national park that today
is a favorite site for picnics.
   He named his city in honor of Emperor Augustus Caesar, but it
became known as Caesarea Philipi to distinguish it from the port of
Caesarea constructed by his father on the Mediterranean Sea.
   American teams working at the site this year have partially
uncovered a dozen 30-foot-high arches that formed one side of what
appears to be a long shopping mall, said John Wilson, an archaeology
professor from Pepperdine College in Southern California.
   The arches now are the bottom layer of a wedding cake of history.
Wilson said Crusader conquerers 1,000 years later built a citadel on
top. In the 13th or 14th century Mameluke raiders from Egypt added a
palace.
   ``On top of it all was a Syrian village,'' Wilson said. Baniyas
was part of Syria until the Golan Heights region was taken by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981.
   Diggers have uncovered a public gate dating to the 1st century
and a 2nd or 3rd century house with mosaic floors, one of which is
largely intact.
   Wilson said ``we are encouraged there may be considerable
sections of ancient Baniyas that are preserved.'' But he estimated
it would take up to 10 years with as many as 100 people working each
digging season to expose a substantial part of the city.
   Historians and archeologists had many clues to the city's
location, Wilson said.
   ``The Pan cave with niches and inscriptions appears exactly on
coins of the 2nd and early 3rd century that say they are from
Baniyas,'' Wilson said. ``There are other coins with pictures of
buildings, which we feel are as accurate, and that's what we're
looking for.''
   The area is referred to as ``Paneon'' by the Jewish historian
Josephus, who says Herod the Great built a white stone temple to
Roman Emperor Augustus there.
   For years, it was strategically important because it controlled
the road from Damascus to the sea, Wilson said. It lost its
importance after Ottoman Turks took control, he said.
   In addition to Pepperdine, the other American colleges that sent
students to work at Baniyas this year were Averett College of
Danville, Va., and Hardin-Simmons University and Abilene Christian
College, both of Abilene, Texas.

<TEXT>  By John Barth; Little, Brown, 753 pp., $22.95; WHEN John Barth first emerged
on the literary scene in the 1960s with his bizarre writing style, the
response was electric. Large doses of sex, symbolism and wordplay-as-foreplay;
throwing verb tenses and first-to-third-person transitions to the winds;
dragging myths out of mothballs and tossing them into the lives of decent,
law-abiding (and Babbitt-boring) middle-Americans -- what was this balding,
stuffy-looking English prof doing to modern fiction?;    He was doing the same
thing (in such books as "Giles Goat-Boy," "The Floating Opera" and the
National Book Award-winning "Chimera"), with lots more fun, that Robert
Graves, John Fowles and Peter Shaffer were doing: He was stalking "mythos,"
dragging it back to the eastern seaboard, and unleashing it at the faculty
club amid the unsuspecting intelligentsia, so we could all laugh at how close
they really were (despite their pompous pretensions) to the true
mytho-ritualistic heart of darkness.;     This toying about with our own
primal roots, both literally and figuratively, is again Barth's theme in "The
Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor." Back to the umbilical labyrinth where
myths hang out (the book actually begins in the womb, where our hero is
chatting with his also-unborn twin sister, Bijou), we progress through many
"voyages" (relationships) of Simon William Behler, a once-popular "new
journalist" whose vogue has come and gone.;    After going down for the third
time in the Indian Ocean, Behler (pen-name: "Baylor" -- "I'm a natural-born
bailer! Get it?") surfaces in medieval times, 1,500 miles away in the Persian
Gulf. Fished out by pirates, he is dropped off at the house of the legendary
sailor Sindbad on the very eve when his host is entertaining a group of
venture capitalists lured there to finance his own next, and last, voyage.
While seducing Sindbad's young, nubile and debatably virginal daughter beneath
the noses of her father and a prospective bridegroom, Behler proposes a
storytelling contest to help secure his passage out of medieval Baghdad and
"back to the future.";    Here's where the problem surfaces. Our two narrators
(the second, Sindbad himself, spending each night in the tub that saved him)
are not the only ones doing a lot of bailing out. If this Sindbad suffered
under the literary constraints of his narrator, Scheherezade, he wouldn't last
until dawn -- much less to tell the tale of voyage six.;    I do not think, as
John Barth seems to, that his own writing style is as passe as we're told
Simon Behler's is. To the contrary; the Behler/Barth "modern" stories of a
young boy coming of age in a small town where he's expected to be "somebody"
are what bails out this book. These wonderful jewel-(bijou)-like flashes into
the life of a writer who wants to be an aviator (until he leaves the ground,)
who is "moored" (anchored) by two sisters named Moore at the beginning and end
of his life, whose spiritual/sexual awakening in Moorish Spain/Morocco leads
to his nearly being drowned by the anchor (moor) deployed by his
ball-and-chain wife . . . nobody does this sort of thing better than Barth.
It's a textbook in technique, for those who want to write great fiction.;   
Which makes us all wonder why he chose, for the counterpoint tales, to depart
from what he knows and does so well. Time magazine says that Barth turns
"daily life into mythology while turning mythology into domestic comedy," just
as "The Iliad" turns funny when it degenerates into a domestic squabble among
the gods. In short, the most ancient form of satire: pulling down the gods.;  
 But Sindbad is not a god, and the "Alf Layla Wa Layla" (1,000 Nights and 1
Night) is not ancient Western myth but medieval Eastern storytelling.
Admittedly it's hard to write a satire on a book that already is a satire; but
this doesn't explain why Barth's retelling of the Sindbad voyages lacks all
the adventure, excitement, color and downright fun of the oft-quoted,
heavily-annotated, 16-volume Sir Richard F. Burton translation of the same.
But then Burton spent so much time in the "souks" he was taken for a native,
while Barth sometimes confuses Moors, Persians and Arabs. (And why are all
those Islamic Iraqis swilling wine as if they'd never heard of Mohammed?) It's
juice, not Zeus, that's needed to get these stories off the ground.;    My
advice: Read the charming, touching, biting modern chapters and skip the rest.
Unless, like me, you like to figure out how a great writer can go from boring
to brilliant, all in the same wrapper. (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Greece Will Take Part in One of Two Fall NATO Exercises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece will boycott autumn NATO maneuvers
in the Aegean Sea but will join another alliance exercise in
Western Europe, the government said Tuesday.
   ``According to the government's firm policy, Greek forces do not
take part in (NATO) exercises in the Aegean,'' said government
spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   He said Greece won't participate in the ``Display Determination
88'' maneuvers in the eastern Mediterranean this fall.
   But Greece will take part in the ``Autumn Forge 88'' exercises
since ``our armed forces do participate from time to time in
bilateral and multilateral technical exercises on a smaller scale
being carried out outside the Aegean,'' Kostopoulos said.
   Since 1981, Greece has refused to participate in NATO exercises
in the Aegean, saying the alliance favors Turkey by excluding the
Greek island of Lemnos from the exercise scenarios.
   Turkey claims that Lemnos should not be militarized, citing the
1923 Lausanne Treaty. Greece maintains the 1936 Montreux Convention
superseded the earlier treaty and allows military installations on
the northern Aegean island.
   Greece and Turkey have a long feud over military control of the
Aegean Sea region.
