   A twin-engine plane with 11 people aboard
disappeared on what was to have been an hourlong tour of the
Hawaiian Islands, and searchers used helicopters and boats to look
for the plane, the Coast Guard said today.
   The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris searched overnight
through the channel separating Hawaii Island and Maui Island for the
Scenic Air Tour Hawaii plane that disappeared Sunday afternoon.
   The Coast Guard was concentrating its search for the plane off
the northeast coast of Hawaii Island, the last confirmed location of
the airplane, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Robert
Bennett.
   Bennett said the Coast Guard received information from Federal
Aviation Administration radar tapes confirming the twin-engine
Beechcraft had left Hilo International Airport on the east side of
Hawaii Island and headed up the island's northeast coast.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA
ground station that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui's Kahului
Airport, said the FAA's George Harvey.
   The plane was to have toured Hawaii Island, including erupting
Kilauea Volcano, before flying on to Maui, said David Tom, a Scenic
Air Tours Hawaii reservationist in Honolulu.
   Tom, who declined to identify the pilot, said the 10 passengers
aboard the plane had set out earlier Sunday from Honolulu on Oahu
Island. He said they were probably tourists.
   Search efforts Sunday included a Coast Guard C-130 search and
rescue plane and a helicopter, two helicopters provided by the Maui
Fire Department and four Scenic Air Tour Hawaii planes, said Bennett.
   Civil Air Patrol planes and a Coast Guard helicopter were to join
the search when it resumed this morning, Bennett said.
   Hawaii police were also asked to check a section of the island
the pilot was known to fly over during tours, Bennett said. Hilo
police Sgt. Prentiss Morino said ground searches Sunday turned up
nothing and police were to resume looking later today.
   Air strips on the neighboring island also were checked in case
the pilot made a landing without informing the FAA, Harvey said.
   No rains were reported on the two islands Sunday, which had party
sunny skies with low scattered clouds and 15 to 20 mph winds, the
National Weather Service office said. Alenuihaha Channel, which the
plane would have had to cross to get to Maui Island, had 5- to
6-foot seas, it said.
   In December 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with
eight people aboard disappeared on flight from Honolulu to Molokai
Island. No trace of the plane or those aboard was found.

   A sightseeing plane that vanished between the
islands of Hawaii and Maui with 11 people aboard may have sent out
an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather prevented rescuers from
searching for it.
   ``There's an emergency signal coming from valley and we think it
could be the plane,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
``But the weather's so bad helicopters can't go in, and otherwise
it's about a 10-hour hike.''
   A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's
signal from the remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is
on the northwest end of the island and within the missing plane's
flight path, Spangler said.
   The valley had no vehicular access, he said, adding that no
decision had been made whether to dispatch searchers to hike in.
   ``We're getting all our information together and seeing if the
weather will let up,'' Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds
persisted in the area Monday.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane disappeared Sunday on what was
to be have been an hour-long flight.
   A Coast Guard cutter, Coast Guard helicopter and seven Civil Air
Patrol planes searched 1,279 square miles of ocean, said Coast Guard
spokesman Scott Hartvigsen. Police on Hawaii and Maui islands also
checked areas where tour aircraft fly, he said.
   Air strips also were checked in case the pilot landed without
informing the Federal Aviation Administration, said FAA spokesman
George Harvey.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft carrying a pilot and 10 tourists had
left Hilo Airport for Kahului Airport and headed up Hawaii Island's
coast under partly sunny skies, disappearing without any indication
of trouble, officials said.
   The plane's last reported position according to FAA radar was
about 10 miles north of Hilo, flying along Hawaii's northeast coast,
Hartvigsen said. Its altitude at that point was not known, Harvey
said.
   Harvey said investigators suspect that if the plane went down it
is in the area of that last radar fix, because it was passing out of
radar coverage and if it had gone further it likely would have been
picked up by another radar station.
   The sky over the area was partly sunny with low scattered clouds,
no rain and 15 to 20 mph wind at the time the plane disappeared, the
National Weather Service said. The plane took off about 1:15 p.m.
and was to have landed at Kahului at 2:30 p.m., officials said.
   Alenuihaha Channel, which the plane would have had to cross to
get to Maui, had 5- to 6-foot seas at the time.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA
ground station that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui, Harvey said.
   The plane was on a six-island tour, said company owner Doris Tom.
The passengers had taken a ground tour of the erupting Kilauea
Volcano before leaving Hilo, she said.
   Most of those aboard are Americans and two are from Australia,
but the names are not being released because not all the families
have been notified, said David Tom, the operations manager for the
tour company.
   In 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.

<HEAD>Rescue Team Recovers Seven Bodies, Find Four Other Victims of Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOKAA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers descended down ropes from a
helicopter to recover the bodies of seven of the 11 people who died
when a sightseeing plane crashed into a steep valley wall.
   County firefighters and national park rangers found the bodies of
the other four passengers, but the recovery was suspended at
nightfall Tuesday. They planned to return to the remote site this
morning.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft slammed into an 1,800-foot high wall
at the back of Waipio Valley on Hawaii Island, shortly after taking
off Sunday from Hilo Airport en route to Kahului on the island of
Maui. There were no survivors.
   The wreckage of the plane was spread over a 300-foot-long,
fire-scarred swath in the thick vegetation. It was found just after
dawn Tuesday by helicopters that tracked the signal from the plane's
emergency locator transmitter.
   Heavy rains and low clouds had prevented aircraft from searching
the area Monday.
   ``Most of it was all disintegrated,'' said Hawaii County Deputy
Fire Chief Edward Bumatay. ``The biggest part they could find was
the engine down in the bottom of the valley.''
   The bodies were taken Tuesday night to Hilo Hospital, where work
was to begin on identification, said Bruce Butts, operations officer
for the county Civil Defense Agency.
   Eight of the 10 passengers were identified late Tuesday as Peter
Spillane and Ann Herbert, both of Sydney, Australia; Jack Merle and
Shirley Merle of Russellville, Ark.; a Ms. Statler of Blue Mound,
Ill.; Sylvie Martel and Nicole Beland of Canada; and Robert Wren,
61, an English professor at the University of Houston.
   Two women whose names were withheld pending the notification of
their families were from Torrance, Calif., and New York City, said
T.C. Campbell, operations manager for Scenic Air Tours Hawaii, the
carrier.
   The plane's pilot, Pascal Meric, 28, of Honolulu, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said Doug Rogers, chief pilot for Scenic
Air Tours.
   The crash was the first in the company's nine-year history.
   A National Transportation Safety Board team was expected to begin
an investigation today into the cause of the crash.
   It was Hawaii's fourth major airline accident in two years.
   In December 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with
eight people aboard disappeared during a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.
   In April 1988, a flight attendant died and dozens were injured
when the front third of the top section of an Aloha Airlines jet's
passenger cabin blew away in flight.
   In February, nine passengers were hurled to their deaths when a
cargo door and a huge chunk of fuselage tore off a United Airlines
jumbo jet some 100 miles south of Honolulu.

   A rescue helicopter searching a remote valley
early today spotted the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that
vanished Sunday with 11 people aboard, authorities said. There were
no signs of survivors.
   Pieces of the twin-engine Beechcraft were strewn over the face of
a cliff on Hawaii Island's northeast coast, three miles from where
aircraft had pinpointed an emergency radio signal on Monday,
authorities said.
   Marines lowered themselves by ropes in an attempt to reach the
crash site, said Coast Guard spokesman David Santos.
   ``Debris is spread out over a 200- to 300-meter area,'' said
Marine spokesman Maj. Kerry Gershaneck. ``There's nothing that our
people see that would identify the wreckage as an aircraft. There is
no sign of survivors.''
   The Scenic Air Tours plane disappeared without indication of
trouble Sunday during what was supposed to be an hour-long flight
from Hawaii Island to Maui Island. The plane had left under partly
sunny skies, carrying a pilot and 10 tourists.
   Heavy rain and strong winds on Monday prevented helicopters from
searching the valley. A Coast Guard helicopter had picked up the
emergency signal from the Waimanu Valley region on the northeast
side of Hawaii Island.
   The valley is about four miles long with several major side
valleys and has a 320-foot-high waterfall. It cuts deep into the
5,480-foot Kohala Mountain and is thick with vegetation.
   The plane's last reported position was 10 miles north of Hilo and
flying at 2,000 feet, according to Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman George Harvey. The plane passed out of radar contact at
that point and would not have re-emerged on radar until it passed
the island's northern tip.
   The names of those aboard, eight Americans and two Australians,
will not be released until all their families have been notified,
said David Tom, the tour company's operations manager.
   The plane's 28-year-old pilot had about 4,000 hours flying
experience and had flown the around-the-island tour about 50 times,
according to Scenic Air Tours chief pilot, Doug Rogers.
   In 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from Honolulu to

   Rescuers worked to recover the last four
bodies Wednesday from a remote Hawaii Island valley where a tour
airplane crashed, killing 11 people.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane slammed into an 1,800-foot high
wall Sunday afternoon at the back of Waipio Valley. There were no
survivors.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft was on a flight from Hilo Airport on
Hawaii Island to Kahului on the island of Maui.
   A three-member National Transportation Safety Board team was to
travel to Hawaii Island to meet with officials in charge of recovery
effort, said Bruce Butts, operations officer for the Hawaii County
Civil Defense Agency.
   Barry Trotter, leader of the NTSB team, said that in addition to
examining the crash site the team would investigate Scenic Air
Tours' crew training procedures and how the company selects its
pilots.
   The plane's pilot, Pascal Meric, 28, of Honolulu, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said Doug Rogers, chief pilot for Scenic
Air Tours. The crash was the first in the company's nine-year
history.
   Rescue workers descended on ropes from a helicopter to recover
seven bodies Tuesday. Those remains were found upslope from the main
portion of wreckage.
   ``The remains of the others, from what I understand, are in and
around the main wreckage itself, and that wreckage is hanging
precariously on the side of a steep valley wall,'' Butts said.
   Butts said Civil Defense officials, firefighters and national
park rangers were trying to minimize the risk to rescue workers
working to recover the remaining bodies.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft struck a sheer valley wall, and its
wreckage cut a 300-foot-long, fire-scarred swath as it slid downhill
through thick vegetation.
   Hawaii County Police Chief Victor Vierra, who visited the crash
site Tuesday, said the impact left a burn mark ``that was the
perfect outline of the aircraft.''
   The seven bodies were taken to Hilo Hospital, where work was to
begin on identification, Butts said.
   Scenic Air Tours on Wednesday released the name of a ninth
passenger: Delphine Clemenz of Torrance, Calif.
   Eight other passengers were identified as Peter Spillane and Ann
Herbert, both of Sydney, Australia; Jack Merle and Shirley Merle of
Russellville, Ark.; Mary Statler of Blue Mound, Ill.; Sylvie Martel
and Nicole Beland of Canada; and Robert Wren, 61, an English
professor at the University of Houston.
   The name of a New York City woman was being withheld pending
notification of relatives, according to company owner Doris Tom.

   Hawaii has the nation's lowest rate of
preventable deaths from chronic diseases and Michigan has the
highest, the federal Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday.
   The CDC found that the 50 states and the District of Columbia
could have prevented at least 26 percent of their deaths from nine
leading chronic diseases in 1986 by reducing such risks as smoking
and cholesterol levels.
   ``The bottom line is there are a lot of these deaths that are
potentially preventable,'' said Steven M. Teutsch, a CDC
epidemiologist who helped research the study.
   ``What we are hoping states do is look at where they fall in
terms of these chronic disease deaths and then examine the specific
problems in their states.''
   The study found that Hawaii had the lowest rate of preventable
deaths, with 26.4 percent of 2,817 deaths that year labeled as
preventable. North Dakota and Utah, both with 33.2 percent, tied
for the second lowest rate. New Mexico, with 37.2 percent, and
Minnesota, with 37.7 percent, rounded out the lowest five.
   Michigan had the highest rate - 53.5 percent - followed by West
Virginia's 53.3 percent, New York's 52.6 percent, Ohio's 52.1
percent and Kentucky's 52 percent.
   The CDC study, published in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that if each state reduced a risk for
its most prevalent disease, the national life expectancy of 73.7
years would increase by four years.
   Teutsch said the study was the first federal effort to track
preventable deaths, which it considered stroke, coronary heart
disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
liver disease and lung, breast, cervical and colorectal cancers in
1986, the latest year data were available.
   Teutsch said the differences in rates of preventable deaths are
``potentially explainable'' by isolating various factors.
   For instance, he said Michigan's high rate may be attributable
to it being a highly industrialized state with high minority
populations where knowledge about risk of disease is low.
   In Hawaii, on the other hand, the diet leans strongly toward
seafood and vegetables, which contributes to lower cholesterol
rates and less heart disease.
   Researchers figured out which state had the lowest mortality
rate of each of the diseases and added those rates to create a
mythical ``utopian state'' with the lowest death rate in all nine
diseases - about 224 per 100,000 population. Then they compared
each state to the ideal.
   Hawaii came the closest to the ``utopian state,'' with 304.7
deaths per 100,000, or 80.34 above the ideal. Thus 26.4 percent of
its deaths were considered preventable.
   Teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for these diseases - such as smoking for lung
cancer and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers
chances of developing the illnesses.
   ``What we've seen is what's been achieved in some state,''
Teutsch said, pointing out that Hawaii has the nation's low heart
disease rate. ``If that's been achieved in some state, it
presumably can be achieved in another state.''
   The study found cigarette smoking contributed to the most deaths
from the nine diseases, 33 percent. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle,
high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   It also found that use of mammography and Pap screening for
breast and cervical cancers could lower deaths from those diseases.

   Hawaii's seafood-rich diet may have helped give
it the nation's lowest rate of preventable deaths from nine major
diseases, while Michigan's industrial lifestyle was blamed in part
for its having the highest.
   The rankings of all 50 states and the District of Columbia came
from a Centers for Disease Control study published Wednesday.
   It looked at deaths from stroke, lung cancer, coronary heart
disease, breast cancer, diabetes, cervical cancer, chronic liver
disease, colorectal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in 1986, the latest year data were available.
   The study found that 26.4 percent of the 2,817 deaths in Hawaii
from those nine diseases could have been prevented - the lowest
rate in the nation. North Dakota and Utah, both with 33.2 percent,
tied for the second lowest rate.
   Michigan had the highest rate - 53.5 percent - followed by West
Virginia at 53.3 percent, New York with 52.6 percent, Ohio at 52.1
percent and Kentucky with 52 percent.
   The differences depended on several variables but could be
explained, at least partially, with a little guesswork, said Steven
M. Teutsch, a CDC epidemiologist who worked on the study published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Michigan's high rate may be because it is highly industrialized
and has large minority populations that might know little about
disease risks, he speculated.
   In Hawaii, people tend to eat more seafood and vegetables; that
contributes to lower cholesterol rates and less heart disease, he
said.
   Researchers arrived at their figures using a model based on
combining the lowest death rates for each disease to create a
``utopian state'' with an overall, combined death rate for the nine
diseases of about 224 per 100,000 people.
   Then they compared each state to the ideal.
   Hawaii came the closest, with 304.7 deaths per 100,000, or 80.34
deaths above the ideal. Thus 26.4 percent of its deaths were
considered preventable.
   The study found smoking contributed to the most deaths from the
nine diseases, 33 percent. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, high
cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   Teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for each disease - such as smoking for lung cancer
and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers chances of
developing the illnesses.

   Authorities ended their search of a remote
Hawaii Island valley after finding the bodies of all but one of the
11 people killed when a sightseeing plane crashed.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane slammed into an 1,800-foot
cliff on June 11, killing all 11 people aboard.
   The bodies of two or three victims were discovered Friday, and
seven sets of remains were found Tuesday.
   Rain and fog in the rugged Waipio Valley forced authorities to
give up the effort, said Bruce Butts, deputy administrator of the
Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.
   ``The weather conditions have turned bad again and we just have
to figure we've gotten all we can,'' he said.

A sightseeing plane that vanished between the islands of Hawaii and Maui with 
11 people aboard may have sent out an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather 
prevented rescuers from searching for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an emergency signal coming from a valley, and we think it could be the 
plane," said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler. "But the weather's so bad 
helicopters can't go in, and otherwise it's about a 10-hour hike." 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's signal from the 
remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is on the northwest end and 
within the flight path of the missing Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane, Spangler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane disappeared Sunday on what was to have been an hourlong flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting all our information together and seeing if the weather will let 
up," Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds persisted in the area Monday.

<HEAD>Maui Boat Missing Nearly 10 Years Found in Marshalls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grave discovered on a small, uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands was believed to contain the remains of one
of five Hawaii fishermen who disappeared nearly 10 years ago,
authorities said.
   The grave and what remained of the men's 17-foot fiberglass
boat, the Sarah Joe, were found on Sibylla Island last month by a
U.S. National Marine Fisheries worker and an archaeologist studying
green turtles and sea birds, Coast Guard Capt. Jim Cushman said
Wednesday.
   Two forensics experts and a 27-member Coast Guard shore group
were sent to the island, located 2,054 nautical miles from Hawaii,
after officials in Honolulu were notified late last month, Cushman
said.
   ``It (the grave) was located some yards above the high water
mark,'' he said. ``It was a cairn of rocks with a crude cross on
top of it.''
   The partial remains, comprising about 60 percent of a skeleton,
including a lower jawbone, were found in the shallow grave, Cushman
said. A skull was not recovered, he said.
   A 2{-day search of the island, measuring about three miles by
less than half a mile, and nearby islands turned up no other human
artifacts, Cushman said.
   The island was described as uninhabitable, with no water or
vegetation, he said.
   The remains were transported last week to the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, where an attempt to make a
positive identification will be made once medical records of the
five men are obtained, said Capt. Paul Bethke. It is possible the
remains might not be associated with the Sarah Joe, he said.
   The Sarah Joe was reported missing Feb. 11, 1979, after it
failed to return from a one-day fishing trip off Hana, Maui.
   A search for the boat was suspended after five days following a
56,000-square-mile search involving aircraft from the Coast Guard,
Navy, Marine Corps, civil air patrol and commercial and private
aircraft.
   Registration numbers on the boat's hull and the boat's
manufacturer's number were used to identify the Sarah Joe, said
Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.

<HEAD>Commuter Plane With 20 Aboard Disappears In Hawaii</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with search continuing, last radar fix on plane,
origin of passengers; CORRECTS style on Aloha IslandAir. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A search continued Sunday for a commuter plane
with 20 people aboard that disappeared Saturday night on a
scheduled 35-minute flight from the island of Maui to the island of
Molokai, officials said.
   The Aloha IslandAir DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach Molokai
Airport after leaving Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. (12:25 a.m. EDT
Sunday), said Don Early, air traffic manager for the Federal
Aviation Administration at the Honolulu Airport.
   There was no distress call from the plane's two-member crew and
no signals have been detected from an emergency locator transmitter
aboard the plane, said Sgt. William Bowker of the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center.
   The last radar fix on the plane was when it was two miles off
the northeast shore of Molokai, officials said.
   Two Coast Guard C130 search planes, two helicopters and two
cutters were dispatched to search the 3,000-square-mile area of the
Pailolo Channel between the two islands, said Chief Petty Officer
Dennis Hubbard, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   By early Sunday, the two helicopters and one C130 had been
recalled from the search area to await first light before rejoining
the search, said Petty Officer First Class Francesca Bozem at the
rescue center.
   Two Civil Air Patrol planes also were to join the search, she
said. Aloha IslandAir planned to send two aircraft to join in the
search at daylight, said Stephanie Ackerman, a spokeswoman for
Aloha IslandAir.
   Kahului is about 100 miles southeast of Honolulu.
   Searchers reported rain in the area was limiting visbility,
Hubbard said. The weather service said there were only scattered
clouds and 18 mph winds during the scheduled time of the flight.
   The plane, owned by a subsidiary of Aloha Airlines, was carrying
18 passengers and a crew of two, Early said. Thirteen passengers
are from Molokai, one is from Maui, two are from Philadelphia and
two are from Houston, said Ackerman. The names of the passenger and
crew were not released.
   About 10 police officers searched the coastlines of Maui,
Molokai and the island of Lanai ``looking for flares or any kind of
distress signal,'' said officer Peter Akuna at the Maui Police
Station in Wailuku.

<TEXT>     They make stops at Kauai, Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. Visitors can
fly in from the mainland and just hop on board.;    The Independence was built
in 1950 and was the first of the sister ships to re-enter the trade after
American ocean cruises had stopped. Bought in 1978 by American Hawaii Cruises,
the ship started sailing Hawaii waters in 1980.;     The Constitution entered
service in 1951 with voyages between New York and Italy, and took Grace Kelly
to her wedding to Prince Rainier in Monaco. In 1982, Princess Grace
rechristened the vessel for American Hawaii Cruises when it joined the
Independence.;    Both ships have undergone $25 million in renovations in the
past 18 months, and both have occupancy rates greater than 100 percent in
summer, since young families book vacations then with children in tow.;   
Along the Honolulu waterfront, the Independence and the Constitution have
become heirs to the long tradition of American shipping. Each week as the
ships depart majestically, a bit of the magic of "Boat Day" is recaptured, and
it is easy to sense the years of tradition that the vessels continue.;    Time
aboard passes leisurely, Hawaii-style. Visitors spend hours lounging in the
sun, walking the decks, exercising in the fitness spas, relaxing in the
refurbished lounges and dining on the succulent Hawaiian fare.;    The
American registry of the sister ships means that they are staffed with all
American crews. "Passengers frequently find neighbors to share the hometown
news with," says Capt. Lawrence W. Kelley, master of the Independence.;   
Reaching all islands;  All the major islands are accessible by American Hawaii
Cruises.;    Oahu, "The Gathering Place," is ringed by protective coral reefs,
its legendary beaches stretching as far as the eye can see. At its heart is
world-famous Waikiki Beach, yet just a few miles beyond are pineapple and
coconut groves and ancient fishing villages.;    Maui may be the only place in
the world where humpback whales cause traffic jams. That is because so many
drivers stop to watch along the Honoapiilani Highway during the November-May
migrating season, when two-thirds of the North Pacific giants, Hawaii's
biggest visitors, stop by.;    Maui is Hawaii's second-largest island, and
also ranks No. 2 in visitors. Lahaina, the old whaling port where humpbacks
sing and cavort for visitors, is still the center of the action, but the
narrow, dusty streets Herman Melville walked are brightly lined with shops,
art galleries, restaurants and night spots.;    Today, the ships anchor
offshore, and visitors are taken by tender to Lahaina. Strolling its streets
and beaches is an easy way to kick back in paradise.;    Haleakala, the mighty
volcano called the House of the Sun, which stretches 10,000 feet out of the
sea, is the not-to-be-missed sight on Maui. Once visitors have seen it at
sunrise, they understand why Mark Twain called it "the sublimest spectacle I
ever witnessed.";    Sunshine on Kauai;  Kauai, the resort of ancient kings
and modern filmmakers, is the third-largest island, and ranks third in
visitors because of its gorgeous beaches, dependable sunshine and wonderful
sunsets. The ancient kings knew how to pick resorts, and visitors are
following in their footsteps to Poipu Beach on its south shore.;    The ships
tie up in Nawiliwili, but it is easy to arrange any ground tour desired. The
port itself is a working harbor, and not a great place to spend a day.;    In
addition to Poipu, many visitors choose the visually dramatic recreational
resort at Princeville. The unsurpassed sight at Puupoa Point, with its post
card perfect vista of Hanalei, was the sight for shooting the Bali Hai scene
in "South Pacific.";    Near the northernmost point of the Big Island of
Hawaii, there is a special place called Waipio Valley. The 2,000-foot gouge in
the earth is one of the great panoramas of the islands, and the two waterfalls
at the head are silver ribbons in the lush greenery.;    Towering above the
little valley is the snow-capped peak of Mauna Kea, home of the world's
greatest concentration of space-age telescopes. This may be the only place on
earth where it is possible to drive in a single day from an orchid-lined road
through a rain forest to a scene of lunar-like desolation high above the
clouds.;    The ships tie up off Kailua-Kona, where visitors can spend the day
or arrange day tours. Hilo is the other Big Island port of call, where
organized tours are a lot better idea than spending the day wandering the old
town.;    Hawaii's not-to-be-missed spectacle is Kilauea, the world's only
"drive-in" volcano, which offers the thrill of frequent, easily accessible
eruptions. The ride around Crater Rim Drive gives visitors the feeling they
can reach out and almost touch the volcano.;    As usual, Twain probably put
it best when he wrote of Hawaii: "No other land could so longingly and
beseechingly haunt me sleeping and waking through half a lifetime, as that one
has done."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (box) ITINERARIES -- Both the Independence
and the Constitution depart every Saturday from Honolulu. The Constitution
offers 3- and 4-day packages as well as week-long cruises; the Independence
has only 7-day cruises. Both ships sail to Maui, Kauai and Kona and Hilo on
the Big Island.; (box) RATES -- The packages offered by the Constitution
include either three or four nights at hotels on the various islands. Prices
for both ships (cruise only) start at $1,095 per person for an inside cabin.
The top end price (outside two-room suite) is $3,695 per person. The company
also has air fare add-ons.; (box) SPECIALS -- A honeymoon/anniversary package
combines a two-day resort stay with a four-day cruise. Rates start at $989 per
person for stays at the Hawaiian Regent in Honolulu and $1,069 per person for
stays at the Hawaii Prince in Honolulu and the Maui Prince. Champagne,
ocean-view rooms are among the amenities.; The cruise line is offering a 50
percent discount off its seven-day inter-island cruises to active and active
reserve military as well as military dependents. The discount applies to the
first two passengers in cabin categories "A through G" for April, May, July
27, Aug. 3, Nov. 9-23 and Dec. 14 sailings. Reservations may be made by
calling American Hawaii's Group Department at (800) 765-5555. Ask for the

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Marie, downgraded from a
hurricane, moved today toward Hawaii. Residents were advised to
prepare for winds of up to 73 mph.
   Hurricane Marie was downgraded late Sunday after its top
sustained winds fell from 85 mph to 70 mph. A storm must have
sustained winds of 74 mph to be classified a hurricane. Marie's
winds still gusted to 85 mph, the National Weather Service said.
   Marie storm was 210 miles southeast of Hilo on Monday night,
heading for Hawaii at 9 mph, forecasters said. If it stays on the
same course, the storm center would pass 130 miles south of South
Point on Hawaii, known as the Big Island, this afternoon,
forecasters said.
   A tropical storm warning, meaning winds of 39 mph to 73 mph were
possible, was posted for Hawaii Island. A tropical storm watch was
posted for Maui County, including the islands of Maui, Molokai and
Lanai. There were no warnings for Oahu Island, where Honolulu is
located.
   Gale-force winds, ranging from 39 to 54 mph, extend 140 miles
from the center, the weather service said.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the east and south
shores of Hawaii Island, prompting the closing of Punaluu Beach
Park with surf on Monday ranging from 8 to 10 feet where it
normally averages 1 to 2 feet, said County Civil Defense
Administrator Harry Kim.
   The southeast section of the island was already experiencing
some strong gusty winds Monday, blowing debris onto some roadways,
Kim said.
   There were no reports of any property damage related to the surf
or wind, he said.

<TEXT>
   High school students on Molokai Island
wept and prayed Monday for classmates and educators who were among
20 people killed in Hawaii's worst commuter airplane crash.
   A National Transportation Safety Board team arrived Monday to
investigate Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712, which slammed into a ridge
near Halawa Valley on the island's eastern end Saturday night en
route from neighboring Maui. There were no survivors.
   Rescuers recovered 20 bodies Sunday from the charred wreckage of
the DH6 Twin Otter.
   The victims included eight members of Molokai High School's
volleyball teams, the coach of the girl's team and the school's
athletic director. Three other island residents also were killed.
   The crash stunned Molokai, a rural island with 6,000 residents.
Many drivers attached green and white streamers to their car radio
antennas Monday. Molokai High's colors are green and white.
   ``It's small enough here so that everybody knows each other,''
said the Rev. Robb Kojima of Kalaiakamanu Hou Congregational
Church. ``It's almost like the feeling when the (space shuttle)
Challenger blew up. In the same sense, we all feel the grief.''
   Students at Molokai High gathered for a morning assembly. State
psychologists and psychiatrists and two sent by Aloha IslandAir
were on hand to help students cope with the tragedy.
   The school will establish a special counseling center as well,
Principal Clifford Horita said.
   State Health Director Dr. John Lewin said a six-member Mental
Health Division crisis team will be available to counsel families
and friends of the victims.
   Fire rescue teams used helicopters to ferry the bodies back to
Kahului Airport on Maui. State crisis team workers were on hand to
assist relatives who were flown to the island.
   The twin-engine plane was 16 years old and had made 28,000
flights, Peter Dudgeon, Aloha IslandAir's vice president and
general manager, said Sunday. It was rebuilt in 1986 and had no
significant maintenance problems, he said.
   The plane left Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. Saturday for a
scheduled 35-minute flight, said Don Early, air traffic manager for
the Federal Aviation Administration at Honolulu Airport.
   The Coast Guard launched a search shortly after 8 p.m. when the
airline reported the plane missing, officials said. The plane was
sighted at 5:45 a.m. Sunday. Wreckage was found over a 300-foot
area.
   There was no distress call from the crew and no signals were
detected from an emergency locator transmitter aboard the plane,
said Sgt. William Bowker of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center.
   The pilot of the plane, Captain Bruce Pollard, 30, had flown for
the airline for two years, Dudgeon said. He and First Officer Phil
Helfrich, 27, were from Oahu Island, which includes Honolulu.
   Aloha IslandAir said the passenger list included Peter and
Elizabeth Wiley of Philadelphia, John Craig and Christina Batura of
Houston, and Hank Gabriel of Maui. The airline earlier identified
Ms. Batura as Christina Craig, which is how she checked in with the
carrier. Her real name was released Monday.
   The Molokai passengers were identified by the airline as girl's
volleyball team coach Odetta Rapanot; athletic director John Ino;
Leilani Ahina, Jared Elia, Lea Dunnam, Colette Kekalia, Natalie
Helm, Nancy Pierce, Nancine Mahiai, Aloma Spencer, Rodrigo Senica,
Jovencio Ruiz and Testa Ku. No ages were given.

   Hurricane Dalilia weakened to a powerful tropical
storm Wednesday and continued on a track that would take it just
south of Hawaii, forecasters said.
   Hawaii Island residents were stocking up on batteries, canned
goods and other emergency supplies as the storm approached from the
southeast.
   Dalilia surprised forecasters Tuesday by turning to the north,
putting it on track to pass 70 miles south of Hawaii Island,
southernmost in the chain, late Wednesday.
   A tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain
were possible _ remained in effect for Hawaii Island.
   At 8 a.m. HST Wednesday, the hurricane was about 230 miles
southeast of Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving west-northwest at about
13 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 70 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 85 mph.
   Clarence Lee, head of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, said
Dalilia was expected to weaken but remain a tropical storm for a few
days.
   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the United States, many
residents were buying emergency supplies.
   ``They've been buying lots of batteries and canned goods _
candles and lamps too,'' said Janice Javar, a cashier at Naalehu
Food Center. ``Almost everyone mentions the hurricane.''
   Naalehu, with about 5,000 residents, is the closest community to
Hawaii Island's south tip.
   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed for the second day as surf
surged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.
   Civil Defense officials closed several seldom-used roads along
Hawaii Island's south shore.
   ``The purpose is to keep campers out so when the storm hits we
don't have to go in and rescue them,'' said Neil Gyotoku, a
spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, he said.
   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads,
Hilo police said no injuries or damage were reported as of late
Tuesday.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over of Kauai with wind up to
117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.

   Tropical Storm Marie headed farther south of the
Hawaiian Islands than previously expected Tuesday, but forecasters
cautioned residents to prepare for effects of the storm.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the eastern and
southern shores of Hawaii Island, prompting the closing of Punaluu
Beach Park. Surf there ranged from 8 to 10 feet, up from a normal
average of 1 to 2 feet, Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator
Harry Kim said.
   The southeastern section of the island also experienced some
strong, gusty wind that blew debris onto some roads, Kim said.
   There were no reports of any property damage caused by the surf
or wind, he said.
   The storm was expected to pass about 250 miles south of the
South Point area of Hawaii Island.
   On Monday, the National Weather Service predicted the storm
would come within 130 miles of Hawaii Island, the Big Island, but
the storm began veering from a westerly course to the southwest.
   At 2 a.m., the storm was about 235 miles south southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island's east coast, and was moving to the
southwest at 9 mph.
   The storm, downgraded from a hurricane Sunday, had a maximum
sustained wind speed of 65 mph with 85 mph gusts. Gale force wind
extended 125 miles out from the center.
   The storm's intensity was expected to change little until the
same time Wednesday, the weather service said.
   A tropical storm warning remained in effect for Hawaii Island
and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of Maui,
Molokai and Lanai. No storm warnings were issued for Kauai and Oahu
islands; Honolulu is located on Oahu.
   A tropical storm warning means wind blowing at a sustained speed
of 39 mph to 73 mph is possible within 24 hours or less. A watch
means there is a threat of tropical storm conditions within 36
hours.

   Hurricane Dalilia surprised forecasters and
turned north, putting it on course to pass close to Hawaii late
today and prompting authorities to warn residents anew to stock up
on emergency items.
   On Tuesday, the storm appeared to be turning away from the
islands, but it shifted to a northwesterly direction and forecasters
said Dalilia could come closer than they initially expected.
   Forecasters said Dalilia's new track would bring its center to
within 70 miles of Hawaii Island's south coast late today.
   The Central Pacific Hurricane Center expected to upgrade a
tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were
possible _ to a hurricane warning for Hawaii Island, southernmost in
the Hawaiian chain.
   At 2 a.m. today, the hurricane was about 310 miles southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving west-northwest at about 13 mph, the
National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained wind speed was
75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74
mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   National Weather Service forecaster Dick Sasaki said Dalilia's
hurricane-force winds extend to 25 miles from its center.
   ``The storm's center would have to pass very close or right over
any of the islands to bring any hurricane-force winds,'' Sasaki said.
   ``Right now our main concern is high surf,'' said Neil Gyotoku, a
spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense. ``High tide is this
afternoon and they're expecting bigger surf to hit about then.''
   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, Gyotoku said.
   Hawaii residents were urged to stock up on batteries, canned
goods and other emergency supplies.
   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed Tuesday when surf surged to
more than 15 feet on the southeast coast of Hawaii Island.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said Bruce Butts, a spokesman for Hawaii
County Civil Defense.
   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads
in some spots, Hilo police said there were no reports of injury or
damage as of late Tuesday.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over of Kauai with wind up to
117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.

Mature travelers who enjoy combining travel with education will appreciate the 
program offered by ElderFolk, a fast-growing program founded in 1984 by the 
Oregon-based Folkways Institute. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk is designed for adults age 55 and older, and is described as a 
"school without walls" because, unlike many study programs for seniors that 
take place on college campuses in the United States and abroad, ElderFolk 
provides on-site lectures, discussions and individual exploration in the 
countries visited. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are designed to be economical while still providing participants the 
opportunity to explore other cultures by direct contact with local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk programs vary in length and do not require any specific education 
level or previous knowledge of the areas visited. There are no textbooks, 
homework or study preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The Folkways Institute has scheduled more than 15 tours for the remainder of 
1990 and through 1991, with other destinations to be added. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the types of tours and subject matter includes: "Discover the 
Agean" (Greece and Turkey), emphasizing the region's influence on the modern 
world, May 3-24, 1991, $2,160; "Back Country Hawaii," devoted to an ecological, 
cultural and geological overview of the Big Island of Hawaii, Jan. 11-20, 1991, 
$1,260, and "Myanmar (Burma), Rangoon to Inle Lake," focusing on the natural 
and cultural wonders of the Republic of Myanmar, Feb. 6-22, 1991, $2,325. 
</P>
<P>
The free ElderFolk catalogue contains details of the philosophy and background 
of the Folkways Institute and a brief description of all of the tours scheduled 
for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
For the listing of tours or a copy of the catalogue, write Folkways Institute, 
14600 S.E. Aldridge Road, Portland, Ore. 97236-6518, or call (800) 225-4666. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers make up a high percentage of passengers on freighters, 
according to a spokesman for the Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn. 
Flexibility is the key to freighter travel since the vessels' schedules are 
dictated by the cargo on board and any that might be picked up along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Newer freighters are being constructed with the express intent of carrying 
passengers, too, and cabins are increasingly more spacious and better 
decorated. One new freighter, Ivaran Lines' Americana, can book 88 passengers, 
although most freighters offering service from the United States carry a 
maximum of 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn. has published a free booklet entitled, 
"35 Most Commonly Asked Questions About Freighter Travel." It tells about 
length of trips, shipboard activities, possible destinations, food service, 
language problems on foreign carriers, accommodations, health requirements, 
fares and discounts, booking procedures and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of the booklet, write to the Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel 
Assn., P.O. Box 218, Flushing, N.Y. 11358, or call (800) 872-8584 during normal 
business hours. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers who are considering a trip to the Hawaiian Islands this year 
can benefit from what are called "Prime Time Perks" -- fringe benefits offered 
by Island Holidays Tours to persons over age 60. Bonus features may include 
tours, special amenities or upgrades at certain properties. 
</P>
<P>
Island Holidays is a large tour operator that specializes in Hawaii and offers 
cruises, tours and resort hotel rooms and condominium rentals throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
For travelers who wish simply to book room reservations in Hawaii, Island 
Holidays has arrangements with 35 hotels in Waikiki, as well as with resorts 
and condominiums on Maui, Kauai and the Big Island. The company is able to 
supplement room rentals with discounted air transportation, airport transfers, 
day-tours and car rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Also offered are so-called "supersavers" that include one or more islands. For 
example, the Super Saver Waikiki/Oahu provides round-trip air transportation 
from Los Angeles, airport transfers, flower lei greeting, seven nights' hotel 
and a welcome breakfast for $512 per person, based on two persons in a room, 
effective Jan. 1 to March 31. From April 1 to Dec. 14, deduct $40 per person. 
</P>
<P>
A three-island trip includes Oahu, Kauai and Maui for nine days and provides 
round-trip air from the West Coast, lei greeting, three-day car rental on both 
Maui and Kaui and inter-island transportation. Cost for this package begins at 
$814 per person, double occupancy, and will vary according to the type of hotel 
or condo desired and the season selected for travel.

<LEADPARA>  THE first Polynesian settlers reached the Hawaiian Islands by sea about 500
B.C. and British explorer Capt. James Cook sailed there in the 18th century,
so it seemed odd to me on my first visit to Hawaii 15 years ago that I
couldn't travel from island to island by sea. Not only the Polynesians and
Captain Cook had done it, but Yankee whalers and missionaries in the 19th
century. But in the 20th century, I couldn't.;    Instead, I hopped on and off
planes for a 30-minute flight from Honolulu to Kauai, about 100 miles away,
and to Maui, another 100-mile, half-hour flight. When I was in Honolulu, there
was Molokai in the distance just 26 miles away. From Molokai to Maui, the
channel is only nine miles wide. But by sea there was no getting there from
here.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But 10 years ago, two former transatlantic passenger ships, the
Constitution and the Independence were refurbished to cruise the Hawaiian
Islands. And last spring I joined 790 other passengers in Honolulu for a
weeklong American-Hawaii Line cruise of these waters that the Polynesians, the
explorers, the whalers and the missionaries had sailed.;    Skies lowered and
rain fell almost constantly as the Constitution made her way from Honolulu to
Maui, Maui to Hawaii and Hawaii to Kauai. To go ashore in Kona on the Big
Island of Hawaii I wore a bathing suit. There was no point in getting other
clothes that wet. And I opted for a submarine fish-seeing tour figuring that,
under water, I would be in the right company. It didn't really matter, though,
as the 46-passenger mini Atlantis submarine took us down 150 feet to a coral
reef in the harbor where schools of zebra-striped fish and surgeon fish and
blue-striped snappers swarmed around a diver feeding them stale bread and
lettuce.;    Of course the American-Hawaii Cruise Line cannot be blamed for
the weather, but the season to avoid in Hawaii -- the inviting warmth of the
climate notwithstanding -- is the December to February rainy season. Even
then, the rain comes in quick, heavy showers and is gone again just as
quickly.;     In Kona, after my submarine outing, I spent an hour indoors at
Hulihee Palace, a summer palace for some of Hawaii's last royalty. (An
advantage of Hawaii, in any weather, is its large number of well maintained
historic houses, palaces and museums -- many operated by Hawaii's equivalent
of the DAR, the Daughters of Hawaii, descendants of missionaries interested in
preserving old Hawaii's heritage.) The palace was rich in Hawaiian antiques
and royal memorabilia (including a 180-pound exercise ball that 18th-century
King Kamehameha the Great is said to have used and a hatbox made from a
hollowed-out coconut tree trunk.);    In Hilo, on the other side of the
island, I saw the early-morning Monday through Saturday Suisan Fish Auction
where hotel buyers poked with their umbrellas at the fish they wanted -- red
snapper, blue marlin, yellowfin tuna and wahoo. The taxi driver who had picked
me up at the ship also had provided a brief tour of other waterfront sights --
the Japanese Garden with miniature pagodas and stone bridges and lanterns and
bamboo.;    A land excursion from the ship took passengers to Rainbow Falls
where mist from the 125-foot falls and sun commingle to make the rainbows;
ferns grow as tall as trees; elephant ear leaves are carried as umbrellas;
philodendron and trumpet flowers grow.;    Another possible excursion was to
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park where Kilauea Volcano lava is oozing like black
tar toward the ocean and one can walk out on the lava flow, feel the heat
beneath it; see the destruction it has wrought.;    Sailing from Hilo to Kona
we watched the burning lava -- like a stream of lights -- descend the mountain
side and splash -- with a further explosion of lights -- into the black sea.; 
  On Kauai, the Garden Island where "South Pacific" was filmed,
fellow-passengers and I rented a car to drive through little tin-roofed
villages, past taro fields to the beauty spots of its North Shore where the
blue seas thunder in on white sand and rock and ironwood trees grow tall. Had
the weather been better, another option would have been a view from a Zodiac
raft of this northern Na Pali coast, or from a helicopter.;    I spent the
afternoon of my Kauai visit wandering the over-manicured, over-fancified
grounds of the Westin Kauai at Kauai Lagoons resort, whose mammoth high-rise
bulk I had seen looming alongshore as the Constitution pulled into Nawiliwili
Harbor.;    On a post-cruise excursion on the Big Island, I spent time on the
still grander similar resort, the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa where the waterfalls
and lagoons and canals are artificial. Trams take one from the registration
desk to one's accommodation (or it is possible, instead, to travel on a
canopied boat along one of the canals). Guests can swim in a pool with
dolphins.;    On Maui, the land excursions included a bus trip through green
hills and effulgent valleys where plumeria and orange African tulips bloom to
the Iao Needle, a rock spearing 1,200 feet from the valley floor.
Unfortunately, again, rain impeded seeing it with clarity.;    Land excursions
from the Independence or the Constitution are an expensive add-on to a
Hawaiian Islands cruise (they range from $15 to $125).;    As for shipboard
time, there are hula, lei-making and ukulele lessons to take take free of
charge; nightly cabaret entertainment; good, if not exceptional meals
pleasantly served in pretty dining saloons. Cabins are well decorated and well
tended.;    And I was right. It feels better, somehow, to be sailing through
an island chain rather than flying through it.;    (check) IF YOU GO --
American-Hawaii cruises leave Honolulu on Saturdays year round with double
cabin prices for a seven-day cruise starting at $895 per person for an inside
or $1,095 for an outside cabin, plus port and cruise taxes of about $50.
Alternatives include a three- or four-day cruise combined with three or four
days at a resort. Information: (800) 765-7000.  </TEXT>

   Magdalena Barut didn't need the money, but she
was bored; tired of ``just chasing the chickens around the yard''
of the Maui home she has lived in since 1954.
   So, on a whim, the 67-year-old Barut applied for a job at
McDonald's, figuring she would be rejected because of her age.
   But not only has McDonald's hired Barut and other senior
citizens like her, the nationwide hamburger chain also lets them
pick their own shifts, gives them 20 hours of training for just one
task _ Barut learned to make french fries _ and in some cases
drives them to and from work.
   ``I don't know I was worried about getting turned down,'' said
Barut, who has been promoted to running a cash register. ``I guess
we just didn't figure how desperate they are for workers around
here.''
   McDonalds _ which traditionally hires high school students for
part-time, minimum-wage jobs _ is only one of the many companies
facing a labor crunch in Hawaii.
   Businesses on the islands of Oahu, Kauai and Maui and Hawaii,
especially those dependent on the ever-burgeoning tourist industry,
are scrambling for workers as the state's unemployment rate falls
to record lows and soon-to-open luxury resorts compete for the
existing work force.
   The state department of Labor and Industrial Relations reported
a statewide unemployment rate of just 3.3 percent for February, the
most recent data available.
   ``Basically, everybody's got a job who wants one,'' according to
a spokeswoman from the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, who said the state's
reputation could suffer if hotels, restaurants and other
tourist-related businesses could not hire enough people to serve
their guests.
   ``The aloha spirit is one of the prime attractions of Hawaii,''
said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. ``If that begins
to change because there are not enough people to fill all the jobs,
we could have a serious problem.''
   A report by the labor department's Tourism and Training Council
projected an average of 6,400 workers would be needed each year to
meet job openings forecast for Hawaii, Kauai and Maui counties
through 1995. But the study found that after this year, only about
1,600 people _ or one-fourth the demand _ would enter the job
market each year until then.
   Those dim projections helped convince McDonalds to turn to
senior citizens to fill its employee gaps. Other companies have
taken more drastic measures.
   The Westin Maui Hotel in Kaanapali, in a joint venture with the
state, helps ferry workers from the nearby island of Molokai, where
a declining pineapple industry led to a 5.8 percent unemployment
rate in February. Other businesses followed suit.
   ``Maui had a low unemployment rate and Molokai had a high one,
so we decided to work together,'' said Lindsey Geyer, the director
of human resources at the Westin Maui.
   Although many are basking in the glow of the state's ``full
employment,'' others say the prevalence of tourist-related jobs _
which account for about one third of the employment in the state _
means many residents earn less than they would in other industries.
Since Hawaii's cost of living is about 26 percent higher than the
national average, many people struggle to make ends meet.
   ``The islands may be paradise, but there also very expensive,''
said Geyer. Educators in the state are also concerned; they say
that because of the proliferation of jobs, young people who would
otherwise go to college are lured away to the work world.
   And economists say that full employment could trigger higher
inflation, because when businesses compete for employees _ offering
more pay and better fringe benefits _ the cost is ultimately passed
on to the consumer.
   Then, of course, there are the tourists.
   1987 was a record year for tourism in the state, with about 5.7
million people visiting the islands, 3.3 percent more than the year
before, according to the visitors bureau.
   ``Today's traveler and tomorrow's traveler want more service,
and that's labor intensive,'' said Dorothy Bremner, employment
analyst for the labor department's Tourism and Training Council.
   An obvious cure _ enticing more people to work and live here _
could be painful.
   ``Bringing people in presents plenty of other problems, and our
infrastruture is already overloaded,'' Bremner said. ``You'll find
very few people interested in making it any more crowded here.''
   A better solution, she says, is to upgrade the skills of the
people who already live here, and make jobs in the tourist industry
career opportunities rather than just average-wage occupations.

<MEMO>  Hawaii Special: Fire &amp; Water  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     You can watch active volcanoes ooze orange fire. Or experience the
mysterious way that black and lifeless lava deserts lie right next to lush
rain forests filled with thundering waterfalls. You can marvel at mountains
capped with snow -- then drive half an hour to sweltering, secluded beaches
made of black, red and even green sand. The ocean's crashing waves can tease
your senses as, just yards away, you soak quietly in natural pools of clear,
still and soothing water.;   Wide open spaces; The Big Island is often
overlooked by tourists -- but we found it amazing in its sheer volume of
natural wonders.;   They do not call it the Big Island just to distinguish it
from the state name itself. It's big -- all the other islands would fit on it
together with no problem. But it is open -- fewer than 100,000 people are
scattered through its 4,000 square miles -- and it is manageable. We drove 350
miles around its circumference in one very long but immensely satisfying day.;
  That is how we discovered that Hawaii, the island, holds a little of just
about everything that Hawaii, the state, has to offer. Actually, everything
the planet has to offer. Of Earth's 37 climate zones, 31 can be found on this
island.;   In Hawaii Volcanoes National Park you can view huge, lunar-like
volcanic craters (not to mention active Kilauea), and then moments later be
hiking in surprisingly lush rain forests.;   Only the hardiest hikers can
reach Mauna Loa, at 13,677 feet the island's second-highest mountain. But
anyone can drive up Hawaii's tallest peak, Mauna Kea, in the midst of a forest
reserve north of the national park. The world's largest observatory -- holding
10 huge telescopes -- takes advantage of the unspoiled atmosphere atop its
13,796 feet. The height also brings snow in the winter months; expert skiers
can make an expensive four-wheel-drive haul up to find untouched powder.;  
The road less traveled; The real appeal of the Hawaiian islands lies in the
sum total of dozens of small delights, the ones that can only be savored by
taking those detours down spur roads that look appealing and hiking up some
muddy trail just to see where it might lead.;   We learned this valuable
lesson in our earlier stop on Maui. You are likely to have heard of some of
its main attractions -- like the "road to Hana," a three-hour drive from the
resort towns over some of the twistiest, windiest coastal two-lanes imaginable
to an isolated little village on Maui's windward side. It is inevitable that
you go, but you must think of it as a journey on the Hana Highway, not a road
to a place.;   Take the time to stop and savor its many nooks and crannies --
dozens of waterfalls, some creating ponds suitable for swimming; family fruit
stands offering reasonably priced refreshments and homemade souvenirs;
roadside mini-trails through bamboo forests and wild gardens of blazing exotic
flowers; quaint missionary churches from the 19th century. We stumbled on a
grove of "rainbow" eucalyptus trees whose trunks were streaked with an amazing
array of bright pastel colors -- lavender, pink, chartreuse and orange.;  
Despite conventional wisdom, you do not absolutely have to backtrack from
Hana, either, although it is true that Maui's paved roads run out pretty
quickly around the far side. We forged ahead a few miles to the much-touted
Seven Sacred Pools, which we learned were not considered sacred and are
considerably more than seven, stepping down from a stunning waterfall to the
ocean in quick succession down a rock gorge. It is almost a religious
experience, however, to take a dip in them, especially the final one, which is
protected from the raging ocean only by a short wall of stones.;   When we got
back to the continental United States with two dozen rolls of landscape
pictures and stories of all those remote wonders of nature that we had managed
to discover, our friends said in amazement that it sounded like we had seen it
all.;   Gee, we thought -- we felt as though we had barely scratched the
surface.  </TEXT>

   A commuter plane with 20 people aboard
disappeared Saturday night on a scheduled 20-minute flight from the
island of Maui to the island of Molokai, officials reported.
   The Aloha Islandair DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach Molokai
Airport after taking off from Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m., said
Don Early, air traffic manager for the Federal Aviation
Administration at the Honolulu Airport.
   The Coast Guard launched a search for the plane after
determining it had not landed at any other airport, said Sgt.
William Bowker of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: A TRIP TO HAWAII WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Switch on your VCR and join us on a journey to Hawaii that could take days in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
On this armchair trip we'll eavesdrop on the major islands and sneak a glimpse 
of developing attractions on Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
So roll the tape. 
</P>
<P>
"HAWAII" (Rand McNally VideoTrips, Best Films and Video Corp., 55 minutes, 
1986). This is a noble effort to show the highlights of the four major islands 
of Hawaii -- Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii, plus a brief 
overview of Molokai -- in less than an hour. Some attractions are given just a 
brief glance, but the good film quality and narration sprinkled with humor, 
legend and history make it a pleasant hour for the armchair traveler and a 
helpful tool for the first-time visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Oahu, the most-visited island, is shown first with familiar scenes of crowded, 
high-rise Honolulu and Waikiki Beach, "where boy meets girl, grandmas meet the 
hula and middle-aged men suffer through days of holding their stomachs in." 
Other sights include Diamond Head, Iolani Palace (the only royal palace in the 
United States), Bishop Museum, Punchbowl Cemetery, Sea Life Park and the U.S.S. 
Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A drive across the island takes viewers to visit the Polynesian Cultural 
Center, the North Shore surfing beaches and Waimea Falls Park. Throughout, 
there are the requisite scenes of shoppers and souvenirs, luaus, hula dancing 
and night life. Information is given on many golf courses and their 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
Kauai, the Garden Isle, with more than 400 inches of rain a year on its peaks, 
is the most verdant of the islands. The video visits three major resort areas 
-- Poipu/Lihue, Wailua/Kapaa and Princeville/Hanalei -- and takes a helicopter 
ride through "the Grand Canyon of the Pacific," magnificent Waimea Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include a boat ride on the Wailua River to the Fern Grotto, a 
stop at Kokee State Park, Kilauae Lighthouse and aerial views of the isolated 
beaches along the majestic Na Pali Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Maui offers still another face of Hawaii. Most of the action is in the historic 
whaling town of Lahaina. Low-rise shops, restaurants and discos line the main 
street. Other sights include the Pioneer Inn, built in 1901; the old whaling 
ship, Carthaginian II, with its small museum, and the Whaler's Marketplace. The 
Lahaina &amp; Pacific Railroad, a restored relic of the sugar-cane era, is 
shown carrying passengers six miles to the high-rise hotels at Kaanapali. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers visit beautiful gardens and accompany bike riders down the side of the 
dormant volcano, Mt. Haleakala. They also drive past the Iao Needle and visit 
the town of Hana and the nearby Seven Sacred Pools. Lahaina also is where 
viewers take off for a brief visit to Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Island of Hawaii combines a bit of everything found on the other 
islands, plus a few extras of its own: active volcanoes, mountains with snow 
for skiing and Porter Ranch, the largest privately owned cattle ranch in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights include a visit to orchid gardens, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, 
black-sand beaches and a marlin fishing trip. Across the island at Kailua-Kona 
there are stops at the King Kamehameha Royal Compound and a drive along the 
Kona Coast to the Capt. James Cook Monument. 
</P>
<P>
The final segment of the video is a roundup of travel information on 
transportation, weather and accommodations. The film shows a selection of 
hotels, with descriptions of their special features. These are not paid 
commercials. Though of little concern to the armchair traveler, trip planners 
should be reminded that these hotel selections were made in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Best Films and Video Corp., P.O. Box 1179, Gillette, 
Wyo. 82716, toll-free (800) 248-7477. Price: $19.99. 
</P>
<P>
"HAWAII" (Fodor's Video Travel Guide, 1988, 75 minutes). Fodor's video format 
follows the style of its travel guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
The first of three segments (about one-third of the video) is a typical 
travelogue giving the viewer a look at many of the islands' popular tourist 
attractions. Most can be seen in any video on Hawaii, including Rand McNally's 
"Hawaii" (see above). 
</P>
<P>
What makes this video different is that it emphasizes practical information 
provided by authorities in the field. It gives tips on such things as the care 
of valuables, exchange rates, use of credit cards and traveler's checks. 
Another segment helps business people master communications devices such as fax 
machines and telexes. This is followed by facts on weather, clothes, 
inter-island transportation, package tours and photo opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the information provided is general to all Fodor videos and not 
applicable in this case. For example, railroad information provided is 
irrelevant as Hawaii has no railroad system. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with an extensive guide to hotels, from moderate to 
super-deluxe. The list provides hotel location and information on amenities 
such as restaurants, wheelchair access and pools. These are not paid 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Also provided is a helpful pocket guide that indexes items on the videotape. It 
contains maps and a glossary of Hawaiian terms. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Doro's Video Guides, Random House Inc., Order Entry 
Department, 400 Hahn Road, Westminster, Md. 21157. Call toll-free (800) 
733-3000. Price: $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
"DESTINATION MOLOKAI" (Destination Molokai Assn., 15 minutes, 1989). The beauty 
and attractions of the relatively undeveloped Hawaiian island of Molokai are 
given comprehensive, if brief, coverage in this tourist promotion video. For 
travel planners, the narration provides information on transportation to and on 
the island, and maps locate the principal sites. (Note: Air Molokai has 
discontinued service since the video was filmed.) 
</P>
<P>
There are scenes of lush tropical foliage, waterfalls, nearly deserted beaches, 
open plains and aerial views along the 3,330-foot sea cliffs, the world's 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers also are shown a selection of hotels, cottages, inns and condominiums, 
given information on their amenities as well as some of the activities 
available. These include helicopter tours, boat cruises, horseback rides, a 
mule ride down to Father Damien's old leper colony on Kalaupapa Peninsula and a 
hike to Hawaii's tallest waterfall in the lovely Halawa Valley, where trekkers 
cool off in the pool at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights covered are the 13th-Century fish ponds, the royal coconut grove, 
petroglyphs, a macadamia nut farm and Molokai Ranch Wildlife Park. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a quick tour of the main street of Kaunakakai, 
Molokai's largest town. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality is very good and the video is a useful source of information 
for those considering a visit to Molokai, "The Friendly Isle." 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Destination Molokai, 1600 Kapiolani Blvd., Suite 923, 
Honolulu, Hawaii 96814, (800) 367-4753. Price: $9.95.

Barbara Campbell, formerly of Kona Village on the Big Island of Hawaii, has 
taken wing and settled at Kamuela (also on the Big Island), where she operates 
a lodging service called Hawaii's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts. Everything from 
B&amp;Bs to private cottages. Her headquarters are in upcountry Kamuela (10/20 
minutes by car from the ocean, less than an hour from Kailua-Kona and 57 miles 
from Hilo). One of Campbell's hosts is former Los Angeles newspaper reporter 
Dee Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
High on Campbell's list is a converted barn with two bedrooms, a kitchen, 
living room, fireplace, TV, telephone, stereo. (The owners live in a separate 
cottage nearby.) Another rental faces Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, with a view all 
the way to the Pacific. Campbell's own Waimea Gardens cottage features antique 
furnishings and a kitchen where guests prepare their own breakfasts with 
ingredients supplied by Campbell (she lives just next door). 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Campbell's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts, P.O. Box 563, Kamuela, Hawaii 
96743. Call (808) 885-4550. Rates: $60/$120. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;B, Beverly Hills Style: Meanwhile, here's the ultimate B&amp;B, with a 
price tag (hold on to your hat) that ranges from $2,000 to $2,500 per night. 
That's the cost for living the celebrity life in a 4,000-square-foot spread at

Bay Hotel before opening his own restaurant at Kamuela. Merriman's specializes 
in fresh meats from local ranches, fresh fish. Gets raves for his wok-charred 
ahi (local fish), his veal with mango and peppercorn sauce, and his steak kiana 
(filets with shiitake sauce). Merriman, who is credited with introducing the 
idea of regional cuisine in the islands, is the son of Woodene Merriman, the 
former food editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Food/cooking is his lifetime 
love.

<HEAD>`Hot Spot' Forms Hawaii Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the
volcano goddess Pele from one island to another. Without knowing
it, the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific
process that formed the Hawaiian archipelago.
   Legend has it that Pele was being chased from island to island
by her sister and nemesis, Na Maka o Kahai, goddess of the sea. In
reality, the ``chase'' was the formation of the islands, part of a
900-mile string of volcanoes that have been active on the Pacific
plate for 70 million years.
   These volcanic islands were formed after passing over a ``hot
spot'' in the Earth's mantle that remains in a fixed location under
the plate, said Reggie Okamura, who has studied volcanoes at the
U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory for 32 years.
   This hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it,
creating magma. The intense heat forces the magma to rise through
the crust. The new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a
layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips
eventually rise above sea level and become islands, he said. These
are known as shield volcanoes because of their gently sloping
contours.
   ``The process that's happening now pretty much is what happened
earlier to form the other islands,'' Okamura said.
   The Pacific plate is moving northwesterly at a rate of about
four inches a year, Okamura said. Each island _ beginning with
Kauai and Niihau and followed by Oahu, Molokai, Lanai and Maui and
Hawaii _ were active volcanoes at one time.
   A large portion of Hawaii Island, the youngest in the chain,
currently sits over the hot spot. It is the island's location that
presently accounts for the volcanic activity at Kilauea, which has
been in continuous eruption since 1983. About 160 acres of new land
have been created as a result, Okamura said.
   Three of Hawaii Island's five volcanoes have been active in the
last 200 years. The other two, which already have passed over the
hot spot, have been dormant for 3,000 and 6,000 years, respectively.
   Scientists say a new seamount is forming southeast of Hawaii
Island and is about 600 feet below the surface. When it breaks sea
level, thousands of years from now, Loihi will be the newest
Hawaiian island, Okamura said.
   The process that forms Hawaii's volcanoes is different from the
one that forms volcanoes on the continental United States, such as
Mount St. Helens, which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption
in 1980.
   The Cascade range that includes Mount St. Helens was formed by
the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate with the North American
Continental plate. As the Juan de Fuca plate is pushed deeper into
the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized
magma that can be released with explosive force, Okamura said.
   While lava from Hawaii's volcanoes sometimes shoots hundreds of
feet into the air, it's unlikely enough pressure could be built up
to cause such a violent eruption as the one at Mount St. Helens, he
said.
   Magma _ called lava only after it reaches the surface _ moves
through the island's volcanoes via a series of tubes and vents. The
tubes are formed when the crust over a lava flow cools, thickens
and stops moving. The rest of the lava continues to pass under it.
   The tubes and vents are created by a system of dykes and sills.
Most of these are found in fractured areas of the volcano known as
rift zones. Lava also can flow over the volcano's crater, or
caldera, Okamura said.
   There are two kinds of lava _ pahoehoe and a'a _ identical in
chemical composition. Pahoehoe lava is black and smooth and
swift-moving. A'a lava is rougher, more fragmented and
slower-moving. Most lava erupts as pahoehoe, with some changing to
a'a as its temperature and gas content decrease. The lava mainly is
composed of silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium and
other minerals, Okamura said.

   A partial list of the 95 people aboard Aloha
Airlines Flight 243, which was blown apart last Thursday during a
flight from Hilo to Honolulu, was released Tuesday by state
Attorney General Warren Price.
   Aloha had repeatedly refused to release the names of the 89
passengers on board the ill-fated flight, saying it wanted to
protect them from unsolicited legal advice and to protect their
privacy.
   The names of pilot Robert Schornstheimer, co-pilot Mimi Tompkins
and flight attendants Michelle Honda, Jane Sato-Tomita, and
Clarabelle Lansing, who was killed, were released last Thursday.
   Price said he released the list because of media requests. It
includes only the 63 people who were transported to or treated at
Maui Memorial Hospital after the plane, with 20 feet of its upper
fuselage ripped off, made a safe emergency landing at Kahului
Airport on Maui.
   The names of the 14 people from the states other than Hawaii are:

<TEXT>
   A Honolulu-bound jumbo jet with 205 people
aboard developed a fuel leak over the Pacific Ocean, but landed
safely early Monday after being diverted to Hilo, authorities said.
   Pilots shut down the TWA airliner's left wing engine when fuel
began leaking from the wing, said Don Morrison, an airline
spokesman in St. Louis.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak, and
made a precautionary landing in Hilo,'' Morrison said.
   TWA Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles, reported it was low on
fuel and 450 miles out of Honolulu at 11:30 p.m. HST Sunday,
according to Dick Hallen, a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer in Los Angeles.
   The L-1011 was instructed to divert to Hilo International
Airport on Hawaii Island, southernmost and easternmost in the
Hawaiian chain and more than 200 miles from Honolulu, Hallen said.
   The plane landed safely at 12:40 a.m., escorted by two F-15 jet
fighters from the Hawaii Air National Guard and a Coast Guard C-130
search-and-rescue airplane, according to Christopher Kimbrough, a
spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Honolulu.
   Marilyn Kali, a state Transportation Department spokeswoman,
said fire-crash rescue workers could see fuel leaking after the
plane landed. The landing, however, was described as routine.
   Morrison said the cause of the leak was under investigtion.
   The plane carried 190 passengers and 15 crew members. The
passengers were brought to Honolulu aboard a chartered plane,
Morrison said.

   A hint that a missing couple from Wheaton College
are still alive has come from an unlikely source _ a vacation book
on Hawaii checked out of a suburban Chicago library and found in
Minnesota.
   The book was returned to the Wheaton Public Library from a St.
Paul, Minn., post office where it was found. It had been checked
out with Scott Swanson's library card, police said Wednesday.
   Swanson, 23, and Carolyn MacLean, 21, have not been seen since
April 2. Their luxury car was found in a downtown Chicago alley
with most of their belongings undisturbed and the keys still in the
ignition.
   Police initially suspected the couple had met with foul play.
But some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance _
they were married secretly about a week earlier _ led to
speculation they may have eloped.
   Commander Ettore DiVito, who is heading the investigation, said
the book, ``Hidden Hawaii: The Adventurer's Guide'' was checked out
of the Wheaton library on March 29 and was found Saturday in St.
Paul.
   Although DiVito decline to chacterize the find as a
``breakthrough'' in the investigation, when he was asked whether
police believed the couple may have been in St. Paul and headed for
Hawaii, he replied: `It's a possibility. We're checking out both
possibilities.
   ``We're sending flyers to St. Paul, to the missing persons
division of their police department and we're making contact with
the appropriate authorities in Hawaii,'' DiVito said.
   Acquaintances have told police the two were saving money for a
trip before their disappearance, that Ms. MacLean had recently
purchased $600 worth of clothes and some excerpts found in her
diary were about trips to exotic locales.
   The couple was to have arrived at the Swanson family home in
Elgin the night of April 2 after visiting Ms. MacLean's grandmother
in Flint, Mich.

fronting a beach recently declared America's finest, another at a honeymoon
hotel on the island of Hawaii and two nights at Honolulu's Sheraton Waikiki,
where the suite Clymer occupied usually goes for $525.;    Thanks to lobbyist
Denis J. Dwyer and cooperative Hawaiian politicians, no day's lodging costs on

show.;    On Maui, they and lobbyist Dwyer checked into the Kapalua Bay Hotel,
where Clymer and Butler each paid $95 a night for $290 rooms, travel records
indicate. According to local officials, Clymer and his party had only one
90-minute meeting on Maui, arranged by Dwyer on a state holiday.;    Clymer's
party had no meetings on the island of Hawaii, even though Clymer's official
itinerary showed one.;    One person listed as attending, Honolulu
Transportation Director Joseph Magaldi, reached by a reporter on the day the
meeting was to have occurred, knew nothing of it.;    With the taxpayers
picking up their air fares, their meals and their discounted lodging, the
excursion appears to have cost Walker $22.96 in out-of-pocket expenses, Butler
$24.50 and Clymer $20, according to their expense reports.  </TEXT>

   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed Tuesday in
anticipation of heavy surf from Hurricane Dalilia, and residents
were urged to stock up on emergency supplies, although the storm
appeared to turn away.
   At 2 p.m. HST Tuesday, the hurricane was 450 miles southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving slightly north of a westerly course
at 12 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   The weather service said it was too early to tell whether the
slight shift north portended a significant change in course or
whether it meant Dalilia had a ``wobbling eye,'' a fairly common
phenomenon among hurricanes.
   If the hurricane took a more northwesterly course, it would pass
closer to the southern coasts of the islands, the service said in a
statement.
   Earlier in the day, data provided by the crew of an Air Force
hurricane-hunting airplane indicated the hurricane's center was
slightly farther south than it was Monday, said Clarence Lee, head
of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here.
   If it continued on the track determined by the airplane, Dalilia
would pass 250 miles south of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the
Hawaiian chain, Wednesday morning, Lee said.
   Dalilia's rapid westerly movement had slowed by nearly half from
20 mph during a 24-hour period, he added.
   ``Dalilia's current location and apparent movement is a favorable
sign for Hawaii,'' Lee said. ``If the trend continues, the hurricane
may pass far south of the island chain and the only effect ... would
be an increase in surf along the southern coasts of the islands.''
   A tropical storm watch remained in effect for Hawaii Island,
meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were possible if Dalilia
moved farther north than expected.
   Hawaii Island residents were urged to stock up on batteries,
canned goods and other emergency supplies in case the storm veered
northward.
   A high surf advisory was issued for beaches along the south shore
of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the Hawaiian chain, in
anticipation of waves as high as 15 feet.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said Bruce Butts, a spokesman for Hawaii
County Civil Defense. ``The tides are pretty high. That will make
surf especially dangerous.''

<HEAD>Fore! Hawaii Leaders Seek Huge Fees From Golf Course Developers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese demand for golf, Hawaii's sunny climate
and a limited supply of land for housing have political leaders
here asking for up to $100 million as par for the course.
   The idea to charge golf course developers ``community impact
fees'' to pay for rental housing has drawn support of Gov. John
Waihee and Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi.
   Supporters call it a way to force developers - who stand to make
huge profits exploiting Hawaii's limited land - to give something
back to the community. Critics say it's a tempting but legally
questionable scheme to tax developers under the guise of state and
county land-use regulations.
   With about 50 golf courses being proposed statewide by various
developers - many of them Japanese - proceeds to the local
government under the plan could climb well into the billions of
dollars. Some developers are ready to pay.
   Jurigi Co. of Japan agreed to pay Honolulu $111 million for a
just-completed $40 million municipal golf course near Pearl Harbor
and $200 million more in community impact fees for permission to
build two more courses on Oahu, where Honolulu is located.
   The City Council rejected the proposal, but its chairman, Arnold
Morgado, agrees with the concept.
   In September, Morgado, the governor and the mayor said golf
courses take up land that could be used for housing, and ``require
large tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which have
scenic, recreational or cultural significance to the community.''
Fasi said the fees would be subject to negotiation.
   Hawaii's leaders are trying to cash in on high-priced
memberships in Hawaii golf courses being peddled in Japan.
   For instance, Shinwa Golf Corp., owner of the Wailea Resort on
the island of Maui, has offered Japanese citizens 1,000 memberships
at $115,000 each in a new Wailea golf course.
   University of Hawaii Professor David Callies, an expert on
land-use law, said impact fees have been found unconstitutional
when they exceed a development's actual effect on such things as
roads, sewers and the environment.
   ``Impact fees are not revenue-raising tools and golf courses are
appropriate open space uses in the right places,'' Callies said.
   ``It is difficult to see how a golf course generates $100
million in infrastructure costs, which is the sole legal basis for
charging such a fee,'' he said.
   Dan Davidson, executive director of the Land Use Research
Foundation, a research and trade organization for landowners and
developers, said impact fees are tempting from a fiscal standpoint.
   ``It is, however, a tax and the city has no authority to impose
this sort of tax in the guise of a land-use regulation,'' he said.
   Harold Masumoto, director of the state's planning office, said
Hawaii could avoid the potential problem of linking golf course
fees to actual impacts by entering into development agreements.
   That way it would not be an impact fee, but a mutual agreement
by the developer to make a contribution to a rental housing fund,
he said.
   In 1988, the state Land Use Commission decided that major
developers had to make 60 percent of their homes ``affordable'' for
low- and middle-income families.
   In August, the same group for the first time imposed the
governor's new policy of requiring hotel and resort developers to
create one non-tourism job for every hotel room they build, or pay
the state $25,000 per room.
   Wali Osman, director of research for the real estate firm Monroe
&amp; Friedlander Inc., said the trend is a result of the state's
frustration in handling housing problems and diversifying the
economy through traditional means. He said exactions from
developers won't solve the housing problems.
   The state is going ahead anyway.
   Last month, the Board of Land and Natural Resources proposed
that Minami Group USA pay $15 million in impact fees in exchange
for extending a permit to complete a $100 million golf course on
land zoned for conservation use. The extension was needed because
rain had delayed construction.
   An attorney for Minami told the board he doubted the legality of
the new proposed assessments, but said his client wanted to be ``a
responsible neighbor'' and was willing to work with the state and
local groups.

A Coast Guard plane Monday continued to patrol the South Pacific in search of a 
San Diego family missing at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Sheri Hughes, together with their sons, Alex, 21, and Ryan, 15, were 
sailing their 39-foot sloop Sea Dreamer on the return leg of a summer-long 
cruise, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Hartvigsen from the Honolulu 
headquarters. The four were last seen July 29, when they left the Palmyra 
island chain 800 miles south of Hawaii, Hartvigsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Dreamer failed to arrive in Hawaii on Aug. 16 as expected, and harbor 
checks in Hawaii and along the California coast turned up no trace of the boat, 
Hartvigsen said. Coast Guard planes searched unsuccessfully off the Southern 
California coast one day last week on the chance that the Hugheses had bypassed 
Hawaii, according to Chief Quartermaster Mark Vavra in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday, Coast Guard planes based in Hawaii have covered more than 
300,000 square miles of the South Pacific in search of the family. The search 
will be suspended Thursday if the boat has not been found by then, Hartvigsen 
said.

   A passenger on the Aloha Airlines jet that blew
open in flight took dramatic photographs of the pilot and co-pilot
assisting passengers after the plane's precarious but safe
emergency landing.
   Robert Nichols, 61, of Kailua, Hawaii, was carrying a camera for
business use Thursday on the flight from Hilo, on Hawaii Island, to
Honolulu. Nichols, an executive of Tropical Rent-A-Car, said he had
inspected and photographed a building under construction in Hilo
that morning.
   Nichols said that when he saw the upper fuselage of the Boeing
737 blow away, he took a piece of paper from a magazine and began
writing.
   ``I didn't know how long I had,'' said Nichols, but he started
keeping a log, pouring out his heart to his wife, Jan, for what he
was sure was the last time.
   Nichols was uninjured, but after the plane's emergency landing
at Kahului Airport, he was held overnight at Maui Memorial Hospital
because he is recovering from a heart attack.
   Nichols said he was director of Pan American World Airways'
training school for flight attendants for 30 years, and had high
praise for the actions of the flight attendants.
   Nichols said he met his wife 40 years ago on his first flight as
a Pan Am steward.

<HEAD>Fuel Line Leak Almost Puts Airliner Into Pacific</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A TWA jumbo jet made an emergency landing after
developing a fuel leak and running low on fuel, and airline
officials said they weren't sure how close it came to a forced
ditching in the Pacific.
   TWA's Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles to Honolulu with 205
people aboard, landed early Monday at Hilo International Airport on
the island of Hawaii, 200 miles southeast of Honolulu, because it
was the closest airport, said TWA spokesman Don Morrison in St.
Louis.
   Asked about a televised news report here that the Lockheed
L-1011 had about four minutes of fuel left when it landed, Morrison
said that had not been determined.
   Passenger Domenic Silvestri said he could hear crewmembers
behind a curtain reviewing ditching procedures.
   The pilot reported at 11:30 p.m. HST Sunday that the jet was low
on fuel and 450 miles out of Honolulu, and was instructed to divert
to Hilo, said Dick Hallen, a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer in Los Angeles.
   Going to Hilo cut about 110 miles off the flight, according to
an FAA calculation.
   Morrison said the plane's left engine was shut down after the
crew realized fuel was leaking from the wing.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak,'' he
said.
   Passengers said they were only told that something was wrong
with the left engine.
   Two F-15 fighters from the Hawaii Air National Guard and a Coast
Guard C-130 search-and-rescue airplane escorted the TWA plane to
Hilo, where it made a routine landing at 12:40 a.m., said
Christopher Kimbrough of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in
Honolulu.
   Fire-crash rescue crews could see fuel leaking from the wing
after it landed, said Marilyn Kali, a state Transportation
Department spokeswoman.
   Morrison said the cause of the leak was under investigation.
   The 190 passengers, including rock singer Bobby Brown, were kept
at the Hilo airport terminal until dawn when they were put on
chartered jets to take them to Honolulu.
   ``It was rough, but I'm glad we got home safely. I'm glad the
Lord brought us here,'' said Brown, who came for a series of
concerts.
   However, he and other passengers complained about their
treatment at Hilo.
   ``It was like being held hostage, you know, by your own people,
by TWA,'' Brown said.
   Other passengers complained they were given no food or drink and
had to contend with dirty restrooms during their wait.

<TEXT>     American Express, in cooperation with Honolulu's Bishop Museum and
Planetarium, has several packages available.;    You can choose condominiums
either in Kona on the Big Island, or on Oahu or Maui with a Big Island
excursion on eclipse day. All packages include eclipse viewing from Waikoloa
Village Stables as well as a post-eclipse champagne breakfast.;    Sample
prices for, respectively, each of two people in a one-bedroom condo or each of
four in a two-bedroom condo: six nights and seven days in Kona, $1,052 and
$788; four nights and five days on Maui, $792 and $731; three nights and four
days on Oahu, $682 and $622.;    Maui and Oahu packages include round-trip
transportation and transfers on eclipse day.;    The Big Island-based Momentum
Travel, reachable at (808) 329-0536 or (800) 346-0276, is offering seven-night
packages at hotels ranging from the Keauhou in Kona for $1,475 a person to the
opulent Mauna Lani Bay Hotel at $2,875 a person. Most of its packages include
a car; all include air fare from the West Coast.; (hbox);    While the eclipse
is being given star billing, it is not the only happening, or reason, for
visiting Hawaii this year.;    The Big Island, which happens to be home to the
southernmost point in the United States -- the town of Naalehu -- will also
celebrate the 200th anniversary of the building of a temple by King
Kamehameha. The celebration on Aug. 17 will be one of Hawaiian traditions.;   
On Oahu, just beyond Honolulu, the Polynesian Cultural Center now offers a
huge IMAX film presentation, "Polynesian Odyssey," which depicts the
settlement and cultures of the Pacific. Also in Honolulu, the Dole Cannery,
the ninth-most-popular visitor attraction, has expanded its pineapple cannery
tour, and Atlantis Submarines, which offers a below-the-seas view of Hawaii,
will have a second sub operating off Waikiki this summer.; (hbox);    Hawaii
expects a decline in tourists from Japan, which has produced the biggest
influx of visitors in the last decade. A poll of 40 Japanese travel agents
showed Hawaii bookings down almost 20 percent for February through April. The
Hawaii Visitors Bureau attributed the expected decline to comments made during
the Persian Gulf war from a Japanese politician, Shokei Arai, who said package
trips by young Japanese were inappropriate at a time when young Americans and
Europeans were on the battle front.; (hbox);    The number of visitors to
Hawaii in January dropped 7.6 percent, the Hawaii Visitors Bureau reported.;  
 A total of 537,040 people came to Hawaii the first month of 1991, a decrease
of 44,000 compared to the same period last year. The decline is blamed on war,
recession and the threat of terrorism.;    The only island to project an
increase was Lanai, where the number of visitors rose 15.2 percent to 4,330
people. The number of visitors to Oahu fell 5.7 percent to 411,210. Maui's
visitor count fell 9.6 percent to 167,900. Figures from the Big Island showed
a 4 percent decline to 100,270. The visitor count for Kauai fell 6.4 percent
to 90,660. Molokai experienced a decline of 5.7 percent to 8,750 visitors.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Politicians, Pentagon Weigh Target Bombing of Island off Maui</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The bombing of Kahoolawe has stopped. The
question is, for how long?
   Use of the pockmarked, 27,000-acre island by the military for
target practice has been suspended for two years. The political
maneuvering over who ultimately will get control of Kahoolawe is
just beginning.
   The dry, mostly barren island 10 miles west of Maui has been
ravaged by 49 years of conventional bombing by U.S. planes and
warships. Some historical sites have been damaged, the landscape
has been scarred and topsoil has been lost to erosion caused by
bombs and grazing goats and sheep. The bombing has also been a
source of deep pain for native Hawaiians who view the island, with
its ancient shrines, as a sacred place.
   The former penal colony and cattle ranch was seized by the Navy
in 1941 after Pearl Harbor. Kahoolawe had been used for target
bombing since 1953, until President Bush signed the 1991 Defense
Appropriations Bill on Nov. 5.
   The bill contained an amendment sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka,
D-Hawaii, that puts a halt to the bombing for two years. The law
also established a commission to help determine the best way to
return the island to the state.
   But the threat of war in the Middle East has military officials
pressing for limited use of the island. Some who worked to halt the
bombing worry that Bush may issue an executive order permitting
military use of the island if war begins with Iraq.
   The Kahoolawe Island Conveyance Commission includes two
appointees from Gov. John Waihee, two Navy appointees and an
appointee from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The commission's
first meeting was scheduled for today.
   The panel can recommend a ban on all military use or allow the
military unlimited or partial access to the island. The three
non-Navy appointees oppose any bombing. The panel's recommendations
are subject to approval by Congress.
   Cmdr. Joel Keefer, a spokesman for the Navy's Pacific Command,
said Kahoolawe is needed to train troops for the long term, not
just for Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Kahoolawe offers us the only place for the kind of training we
need to perform ... aircraft, gunfire support, amphibious
landings,'' Keefer said. ``We have forces in the Pacific and we
need to train them where they are.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, has flip-flopped on the the issue
twice in recent months. He was a longtime advocate of the
military's use of Kahoolawe, then came out in support of Akaka's
bill before the November election and pledged to work for the
return of the island to Hawaii.
   Last week, he said the island is needed to train troops for
Operation Desert Shield.
   Inouye's reversal ``disappointed many of us,'' said Dr. Noa
Emmett Aluli, co-founder of the Protect Kahoolawe Ohana and a
member of the commission. Aluli helped form the Protect Kahoolawe
Ohana in 1975 and has taken part in several ``occupations'' of the
island to prevent target bombing.
   Aluli said the island holds a special spiritual and cultural
significance to native Hawaiians. Ancient Hawaiians were the only
people ever to inhabit the island. There are fishing shrines,
agricultural shrines, major temples and housing sites, which have
landed Kahoolawe on the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``The history of our ancient Hawaiian people is intact on
Kahoolawe,'' Aluli said. ``No way will I allow a resumption of
bombing.''
   Maui Mayor Hannibal Tavares, another commission member, said as
the western part of Maui becomes more populated bombing of
Kahoolawe becomes more dangerous because errant shells can strike
the cities of Lahaina and Kihei.
   Tavares and others say the military has better sites to train
personnel for a desert war, including desert areas near bases in
California, Nevada and Texas.
   It's unclear how much it would cost to restore the island.
   Aluli said the government should find money to ``green'' the
island back to its natural state, whatever the cost.

   A tropical storm watch was posted for the
120,000 residents of Hawaii Island as a ``dangerous'' Hurricane
Fabio and its 125 mph gusts churned toward the Hawaiian Islands
today, forecasters said.
   At 2 a.m. today (8 a.m. EDT) the storm's center was 530 miles
east-southeast of Hilo and 740 miles east-southeast of Honolulu,
with a course and speed that would bring it just south of Hawaii,
the southernmost island in the chain, on Friday.
   If the course and speed remained unchanged, it would be near
Oahu, the most populous island of 850,000 where Honolulu is
located, on Saturday, forecasters said.
   Maximum sustained winds were 105 mph, with tropical force winds
between 39 mph and 73 mph extending 180 miles from the center. The
intensity diminished from early Wednesday when gusts reached 175
mph.
   ``It's a large storm and quite intense,'' said Hans Rosendal, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu.
   ``It likely will come quite close to the islands. It is still a
dangerous storm.''
   A track up the chain's western side would bring the more intense
and dangerous side of the storm over the islands, he said.
   Although the storm had not weakened in six hours, Rosendal said
storms usually diminish in strength as they move away from the
equator and over cooler waters.
   Supermarkets contacted around the state Wednesday said they had
not noticed any big rush to buy items as batteries, candles,
charcoal or canned goods that Civil Defense officials advised
residents to have on hand.
   Observers assigned to spend Wednesday night on Hawaii Island's
east coast to watch for rising surf generated by the approaching
storm reported no problems, said Bruce Butts, operations officer
for the Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
skirted Oahu and ran over Kauai and Niihau in November 1982 with
117 mph winds, causing $234 million damage. There were no deaths
officially attributed to that storm.

   A hurricane with reduced top winds of 100 mph
spun toward Hawaii Sunday, bringing the threat of high waves and
warnings to stay off the beach.
   Hurricane Marie, was centered about 380 miles east-southeast of
Hilo on the island of Hawaii Sunday afternoon, and showed more
signs of weakening, the National Weather Service said.
   Sustained winds near its eye fell to 80 mph, with top gusts
reaching 100 mph. The hurricane was expected to be downgraded to
tropical storm status Sunday night once sustained winds dropped
below 75 mph, forecaster Tim Craig said.
   Gale force winds, which range from 39 mph to 54 mph, extended
150 miles from the center of the hurricane. Waves kicked up by the
storm were expected to reach Hawaii, known as the Big Island, late
Sunday or early Monday, the weather service said.
   All ocean and beach activities along the southern and eastern
coasts of Hawaii should be halted because of the high surf danger,
Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim said.
   Hurricane Marie, moving westward at about 10 mph, would pass
about 70 miles off the southern tip of Hawaii on Monday if it
maintains its course and speed. On Tuesday it would pass about 200
miles south of Oahu, the island where Honolulu is located, the
weather service said.
   To monitor rising surf, residents along the affected coastlines
will maintain a watch and report to Civil Defense officials, Kim
said.
   The last major storm to hit the Hawaiian islands was Hurricane
Iwa, which struck on Nov. 24, 1982 and caused $234 million damage,
primarily to the islands of Oahu and Kauai.

   A mysterious explosion ripped open an
Aloha Airlines jet ``like a convertible'' at 24,000 feet, injuring
60 people and throwing or blowing a flight attendant to her death
before the pilot landed safely.
   ``There was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up
and we were looking at blue sky,'' said passenger Bill Fink of
Honolulu.
   The Boeing 737, with one of its two engines aflame and about 15
to 20 feet of its cabin exposed behind the cockpit and down to the
level of the passenger seats, flew for 25 miles after the blast and
made an emergency landing at Kahului Airport at 2 p.m. Thursday (8
p.m. EDT), airline officials said.
   The cause of the blast on Aloha Flight 243 was unknown Thursday
night, said Kevin Morimatsu, a spokesman for the state Department
of Transportation.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was sending
investigators to the scene and FBI agents were sent from Honolulu
to determine whether the blast was caused by a bomb, said FBI
spokesman Robert Heafner.
   However, sources close to the federal investigation in
Washington said investigators were focusing most heavily on a
possible structural failure that may have been caused by a rapid
decompression and that the force of strong wind at 24,000 feet may
then have ripped away the huge section of fuselage. The sources
spoke on condition they not be identified.
   George Harvey, Federal Aviation Administration area coordinator
for Honolulu, said today he could not confirm whether federal
investigators suspected that a structural failure caused the
fuselage to tear away from the airplane.
   ``It stands to reason that they're checking everything _
structure failure, explosive devices,'' Harvey said. NTSB
investigators will hold their first news conference later today, he
said.
   Another passenger, Alice Godwin of Boulder City, Nev., said she
put on a life jacket and put her head between her knees. ``I sang
all the hymns I knew,'' she said. ``That kept me busy.''
   ``Everybody screamed,'' said Dan Dennin, also of Honolulu.
``However, it was very brief _ the panic. ... The rest of the plane
was intact, and we did not go into any unusual attitudes or
anything like that. I think that people realized the plane was
still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing
whatever they could do to save their lives.''
   Passenger Daniel Westfall, of Novato, Calif., said the plane
``jerked around, up and down.''
   Mark Eberly, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he dropped
to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its
engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing. ``I saw hair
flying in the wind and arms dangling,'' he said.
   Craig Nichols of Pocatello, Idaho, said after the plane came to
a stop on the ground, he saw ``some really mangled people,''
including one with an arm almost severed.
   ``It looked like a normal landing with the whole top of the
plane gone,'' he said.
   ``It looked like a convertible,'' said Joe Ronderos of Los
Angeles.
   ``It was like somebody had peeled off a layer of skin. You could
just see all the passengers sitting there,'' said George Harvey,
area coordinator for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Honolulu.
   Officials at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the primary subsidiary
of Boeing Co., said there were no fuel lines or other potential
sources for an explosion in that part of the plane.
   ``The fuel is in the wing, the engines are in the wing and the
fuel lines are all right there,'' Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said in
Seattle.
   ``To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' Cole
said. ``I think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not
related to any other accidents we have had.''
   Even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore
loose from an engine and ripped into the fuselage, it could not hit
forward from the wing, and the effect would be nothing like what
happened to the Aloha plane, he said.
   The plane was one of nine 737-200s delivered to Aloha in the
late 1970s, said Boeing spokesman David Jimenez. The first 737-200
was put into service in April 1968.
   At a news conference in Honolulu, Maurice Myers, president of
Aloha Airlines, said nothing is stored in the area of the the blast.
   Myers cited the ``extraordinary performance'' of pilot Robert L.
Schornstheimer in bringing the 737-200 in safely. Schornstheimer
has flown for the airline for 12 years.
   ``I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so
smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said passenger
John Lopez, 40, of Hilo.
   ``I've had worse landings in normal aircraft,'' Dennin said.
   Sixty people were taken to Maui Memorial Hospital and 12 were
admitted, two in critical condition and four serious, said Dr.
Charles Mitchell, emergency room director. Injuries included burns,
bruises and cuts, he said.
   The missing flight attendant, identified as Clarabelle B.
Lansing of Honolulu, was probably either ejected by the blast or
blown out of the plane by the wind, said Clifford Hue, another FAA
area manager.
   ``I think the stewardess (Mrs. Lansing) had just picked up the
microphone to start talking'' when the explosion occurred, Fink
said.
   Fink and Dennin said some of the passengers hung on to another
standing flight attendant so she would not be sucked out of the
plane, and they praised the cabin crew for helping calm the
passengers.
   The U.S. Coast Guard mounted a search that included a cutter, a
C-130 search and rescue aircraft and two helicopters, said Coast
Guard spokesman Petty Officer Jeffrey Crawley.
   However, searchers found no trace of Mrs. Lansing, a 37-year
employee of the airline, or the missing section of the plane, he
said.
   The explosion occurred southeast of Maui while the plane was at
an altitude of 24,000 feet, the airline said. It said the 110-mile
flight from Hilo on Hawaii Island to Kahului carried 89 passengers,
five crew members and an air traffic controller from Hilo Airport.

<TEXT>
   Moderate earthquakes struck in Southern California and in
Hawaii, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries
in either temblor.
   The California quake rattled residents along a 100-mile stretch
from Palm Springs to Los Angeles today, officials said.
   The quake, centered about seven miles northwest of San
Bernardino, hit at 1:41 a.m. and measured 4.3 on the Richter scale,
said Hall Daily, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It shook us pretty good,'' said Jay Diamond, a disc jockey for
KFRG-FM. ``The glass on the booth was shaking.''
   In Hawaii, a quake that registered 4.6 on the Richter Scale
shook Hawaii Island's Puna district at 11:13 p.m. Wednesday, said
William Mass, a geophysist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center on
the island of Oahu.
   It didn't cause a tsunami, or tidal wave, Mass said.
   Police checked the area around the epicenter for signs of
damage, but found none, said Officer Randy Arello.
   ``It was strong enough to feel, but not that bad,'' Arello said.
   Quakes ranging in magnitude from 4 to 5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion are considered moderate, and can cause some local
damage, mostly broken houseware, items falling from shelves, broken
windows and cracks in poorly built structures.

   The strongest earthquake to hit Hawaii in
six years shook a sparsely populated area of Hawaii Island already
ravaged by lava, destroying two homes and generating a small tidal
wave.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes
Monday, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   ``Our first priority this morning is to check certain remote
areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes,'' Kim said.
``Early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped.''
   The temblor, caused by the 6{-year-old eruption of Kilauea
Volcano, struck Sunday evening and measured 6.1 on the Richter
scale, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   It was centered west of Kalapana, a small coastal town on the
south flank of the volcano, said Bruce Turner, a geophysicist at the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.
   The quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by
the movement of underground magma, or molten rock, said Bob
Koyanagi, a seismic analyst at the Geological Survey's Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory.
   Reggie Okamura, a spokesman for the observatory, said scientists
had recorded numerous aftershocks. The strongest, measuring 4.0 on
the Richter scale, was recorded Sunday night, he said.
   Kilauea lava has destroyed 68 homes in the Kalapana area since
its latest eruption began Jan. 3, 1983. Four homes were destroyed in
May, and last Thursday a Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitor
center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure.
   Koyanagi said pressure became too great within the world's most
active volcano, causing its south flank to move and triggering the
earthquake.
   The tidal wave, which measured 22.8 inches high at Honuapo, 8.4
inches at Kapoho and 5.6 inches at Hilo, caused no damage, Turner
said.
   Five people were injured by falling debris inside homes, but none
required hospitalization, Kim said. Crews were working to repair
downed power lines.
   It was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since Nov. 15,
1983, when a 6.6 temblor caused several million dollars damage on
Hawaii Island.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

Kaolelo Ulaleo remembers trekking with his grandmother into the rain forest, an 
enchanting place where feathery ferns grew tall enough to dwarf a small boy. 
</P>
<P>
She taught him to pull roots from the moist earth to make tea and pick berries 
for traditional home remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, Wao Kele is the spoon that feeds you," said 41-year-old Ulaleo, who 
has continued to visit the forest throughout his adult life. "You come inside, 
and everywhere is God." 
</P>
<P>
Today, other visitors have come to the forest that Ulaleo treasures, known as 
Wao Kele o Puna, or Rain Belt of Puna, on the island of Hawaii. Their mark is 
less subtle. 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers of True Geothermal Energy Co. have cleared several acres of 
trees and tangled undergrowth in hopes of tapping volcanic steam for a 
25-megawatt power plant. In the process, the industrial newcomers have taken 
center stage in the struggle over the future of the last major tract of lowland 
tropical rain forest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents in Hawaii and on the mainland argue that geothermal development could 
destroy a unique and fragile ecosystem by slicing through it with a web of 
pipes, generators and transmission lines. Hawaii's forests are especially 
prized because most of their plants and animals are found nowhere else in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest danger to any tropical forest is fragmentation," said Dan Taylor, 
chief of resources management at nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. "It can 
only go so far before the whole system collapses." 
</P>
<P>
Formal challenges have quietly and laboriously made their way through the 
courts and government hearing rooms for years. Ironically, geothermal energy is 
usually considered an environmentally benign alternative, and partly for that 
reason, the early local skirmishes attracted little notice beyond Hawaii's 
shores. But the issue of the rain forest changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect to save the rain forests in Brazil and Malaysia if we can't 
save our own?" asked Suzanne Head of the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action 
Network, which has seized on the case as a test for the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
As drilling begins in the forest, the struggle has moved into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested in late October for trying to block trucks hauling 
equipment to the site, 3 miles deep into the rain forest. Two weeks ago, 
protesters staged sit-ins at the offices of Gov. John Waihee and held all-night 
vigils outside to dramatize their call for a moratorium on geothermal 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Wao Kele o Puna is just part of a sprawling geothermal resource zone designated 
by the state on the eastern slope of Kilauea Volcano. An ambitious plan 
designed to promote Hawaii's energy independence calls for geothermal plants to 
produce up to 500 megawatts of power, much of it to be carried through undersea 
pipes to Honolulu and elsewhere in this island chain. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the plan has provoked opposition from various quarters, with the 
arguments ranging from the spiritual to the practical. 
</P>
<P>
Some native Hawaiians consider geothermal drilling a violation of the volcano 
goddess, Pele, and have appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, without 
success. Now they are challenging the legality of the state's transfer of 
27,000 acres of forest land, including Wao Kele o Puna, to a private estate for 
development. The case is on appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents, soured by noise and noxious fumes from a small, experimental 
plant outside the forest, have argued against geothermal development on health 
and safety grounds. They also question the wisdom of drilling near an active 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that has grabbed the most attention in this environmentally 
conscious age is the threat to the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a native Hawaiian struggle any more," said Palikapu Dedman, 
president of the Pele Defense Fund, which has led the legal fight. "It's 
everybody's struggle now." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii's once extensive lowland forests have been all but consumed since the 
first Polynesian voyagers arrived. The Puna forest's inaccessibility and 
proximity to the volcano have helped protect it, until now. Naturalists argue 
that a geothermal network in the area would hasten the invasion of aggressive, 
non-native species that have decimated other areas. They also fear the effects 
of noise, lights and emissions on wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests have moved to the forefront of environmental concerns in 
the past few years as fears over global warming have heightened. The forests 
are considered crucibles of life itself because they help regulate the Earth's 
climate and house nearly half of all plant and animal species. But these rich 
habitats are fast disappearing as developing countries clear vast areas for 
timber or agriculture. An estimated 50 million acres a year is destroyed 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame global warming on such deforestation and the burning of wood 
and fossil fuels. Leaders of industrialized nations, including President Bush, 
have called on their Third World counterparts to stop the plunder of the rain 
forests. Although Wao Kele o Puna is tiny by comparison to other tropical 
forests, environmentalists consider it strategically important to their 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-member Rainforest Action Network has begun distributing leaflets to 
Hawaii-bound travelers at West Coast airports, with fluorescent green stickers 
that read "Save Hawaii's rain forests. Stop the Big Island power plant, or I 
stop traveling." It also plans a demonstration Dec. 14 at True Geothermal's 
Casper, Wyo., headquarters and simultaneous protests in Hawaii and California. 
And it is calling for a boycott of Hawaii-made products. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have emotional attachments to Hawaii because it's unique and 
beautiful," Head said. "Given the visibility of the rain forest issue and the 
fact that this one is in our country, I think there is a pretty good chance of 
actually stopping the project." 
</P>
<P>
But geothermal energy has strong allies in Hawaii. Along with the electric 
utility, the state government promotes geothermal power as a cheap, clean and 
indigenous source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the options, geothermal continues to be the most attractive," said 
Maurice Kaya of the state's energy program office. "The power is available 24 
hours a day, and the money doesn't leave the state." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii depends on oil, most of it foreign, for 90% of its energy needs. While 
the islands have abundant wind and sunshine, those energy sources are 
intermittent and expensive compared to geothermal, Kaya said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Kawada, Hawaii representative for True Geothermal, said the company chose 
to drill here because of the state's commitment to geothermal energy. The 
developer, he noted, has already endured an exhaustive permit process and plans 
to use just 350 acres of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through about seven years of regulatory approvals," he said. "These 
issues have all been discussed at length many times, not just once. We feel we 
have the right to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Geothermal development was originally slated for another forest, known as 
Kahaualea, further upland on the volcano's rift zone. But naturalists -- and 
nature itself -- intervened. While the proposed drilling was being contested as 
a threat to a pristine native ecosystem, Kilauea Volcano began to erupt in 1983 
and eventually buried much of the area in fresh lava. Some native Hawaiians 
suggest that Pele was making her feelings known about geothermal development. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the state Board of Land and Natural Resources agreed to exchange the 
private estate lands at Kahaualea for the state-owned Wao Kele o Puna to allow 
geothermal development in the lowland forest. Environmentalists supported the 
trade because, like most highland areas, Kahaualea's ecosystem was more intact 
than Wao Kele o Puna. But that hasn't stopped them from trying to save Wao Kele 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Those same people were who were saying 'Go down to the Natural Area Reserve' 
are now saying that we should preserve it," complained Kawada, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lamoureux, a professor of botany at the University of Hawaii and a 
consultant to the developer, contends that the threat to the Wao Kele has been 
exaggerated. The forest is not pristine, and drilling sites were chosen to 
minimize the impact on native ecosystems, he said. He also discounts the threat 
of emissions, noting that 
</P>
<P>
wildlife here has evolved around volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There are patches of good forest and there are patches that aren't," Lamoureux 
said. "The best lowland forest is outside of the geothermal zone. . . . We're 
talking about meddling with an area that has already been trashed by strawberry 
guava, mynah birds and wild pigs (non-native species). I'm not convinced this 
project will have any measurable effect." 
</P>
<P>
But other natural scientists disagree. While foreign plants have infested parts 
of the Puna forest, much of it is considered a rare collection of varied 
ecosystems that have sprung up after successive lava flows over the centuries. 
The forest also boasts large populations of native birds, which elsewhere have 
fled to higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a mosaic of different aged forests, from 600 years to the present," 
said Jim Jacobi, a botanist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who has 
mapped native vegetation throughout Hawaii. "It's a really dynamic set of 
ecosystems that doesn't exist anywhere else in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost so many areas in Hawaii," he added. "What little we have left is 
priceless." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its distance from any major land mass, Hawaii is considered a 
storehouse of revolutionary wonders. Only a few seeds, birds and insects were 
hardy enough to make their way here after the first volcanic cones burst 
through the ocean's surface millions of years ago. From those few early 
arrivals, a plethora of native species have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the most isolated islands on the face of the Earth," noted Taylor. 
"More than 90% of Hawaii's biota are endemic, which means they are found only 
here, a far higher rate than anywhere else. So they're of tremendous interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many lessons to learn," he said. "But we're tossing the books out 
before we've read them."
