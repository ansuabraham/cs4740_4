  [Text] Washington, June 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today held a welcome ceremony for Japanese Emperor 
Akihito and Empress Michiko at the White House South Lawn. 
  "Your Majesties visit us at a moment when it is clear that 
the destinies of our two peoples are inextricably linked," 
Clinton said at the ceremony attended by about 4,000 people. 
  "We share a common vision. It is a vision of democracy and 
prosperity... [ellipses as received], of a world where we trade 
freely in ideas and goods," Clinton said. 
  "Our commitment to common ideals is firm, our determination 
to work with you is strong," Clinton added. 
  Emperor Akihito said that "Our two countries have overcome 
the deplorable rupture brought about by war and have forged a 
close and cooperative relationship." 
  "I sincerely hope that this visit will further contribute to 
the promotion of friendship between our two peoples," the 
emperor said. 
  The emperor and empress were greeted with full honors 
including a 21-gun salute. 
  They will attend a state dinner in the Rose Garden of the 
White House hosted by President Clinton this evening. 
  The couple arrived in Atlanta June 10 for the first leg of 
their 16-day tour in the United States. They plan to visit 11 
U.S. cities. 
  They will leave Washington Wednesday [15 June] and travel to 
the University of Virginia and then on to New York.

   Chinese Premier Li Peng met Japan's emperor and
empress today and invited them to visit China, government officials
said.
   Li made the invitation during a 20-minute meeting with the newly
enthroned monarch at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, a senior Imperial
Household Agency official said.
   If the invitation is accepted, Emperor Akihito would be the
first Japanese monarch to visit China.
   But the palace spokesman said several problems exist and the
visit would have to await the end of a year of court mourning for
Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, who died on Jan. 7 at age 87.
   ``Premier Li said that he hoped the royal couple would visit
when the time was right for them. In reply, the emperor thanked him
but said the decision must be made by the government,'' said the
agency official.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the two also discussed ``their nations' 2,000-year history,
including World War II.''
   Bitter memories of Japan's actions during World War II often
have clouded Japan-China relations. After sharp criticism by China
and other nations, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in February
retrated a statement that future historians must decide whether
Japan was an aggressor.
   More than 10 million Chinese died during Japan's 1937-45
invasion of the Chinese mainland. Beijing reacts strongly to any
Japanese attempt to deny responsibility.
   Japanese news reports have speculated that Akihito would express
regret over Japan's militarist past during today's meeting, but
government officials refused to confirm or deny this.
   ``The emperor expressed his views on the nations' pasts, and Li
welcomed those views,'' said the official.
   Earlier today, Japan announced it would lend China up to $734
million in the current fiscal year. The loan is to help fund 11
projects for modernization in China, including an expansion of
ports in Lianyungang and Qingdao and construction of a subway in
Beijing.
   Li is on a five-day official visit to Japan accompanied by
senior officials, including Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who met
today with his Japanese counterpart, Sousuke Uno.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Japan was Zhao Ziyang, now
head of China's Communist Party, in May 1982.

  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Jeffrey Ku, chairman of 
the Taipei-based Chinatrust Commercial Bank, was granted an 
audience with Japanese Emperor Akihito Wednesday [6 April]. 
  "I feel honored to have met with the Japanese emperor at his 
Tokyo palace," Ku said Thursday upon his return from a five-day 
visit to Japan. 
  Ku, also an unpaid advisor to Taiwan's Executive Yuan, 
stressed that his visit to Japan was private. 
  Ku said Emperor Akihito expressed his goodwill and regard 
for 
Taiwan. "Akihito was interested in Taiwan's current 
developments," he noted. 
  Ku said he briefed the Japanese emperor on Taiwan's economic 
strength and its role in Southeast Asian economic development. 
  "We also exchanged views on the possible impact on Asia of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the prospects for 
the formation of the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus and the 
Asian Free Trade Agreement," Ku said. 
  Ku was the first Taiwan businessman granted a formal 
audience 
with Akihito since the emperor took the throne in October 1989. 
Akihito talked briefly with [passage indistinct]. 
  Political observers said Jeffrey Ku's meeting with Akihito 
would boost the development of substantive ties between Taiwan 
and Japan, even though the Japanese emperor is just a spiritual 
leader and wields no political power. 
  Japan recognizes Beijing and has been reluctant to develop 
any official ties with Taiwan for fear of offending communist 
Chinese leaders. 
  Many countries, including the United States, France and 
Germany, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit Taiwan, 
but Japan has not followed suit.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 1 KYODO -- The year 1994 will be busy 
for Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko with preparations 
proceeding for the couple's visits to the United States and 
Europe, the first attempt by a Japanese monarch to travel 
overseas twice in one year. 
  In mid-June, the emperor and the empress are expected to 
travel to the U.S., where they will visit eastern, southern and 
western cities. They also plan to make a stopover in Hawaii 
during the journey, official sources said. 
  Preparations are also under way for their trip to Britain 
and 
France in autumn, the sources said. 
  It will be the first time that a Japanese emperor will make 
more than one overseas trip in a year, they said. 
  A visit to the Middle East by Crown Prince Naruhito and his 
wife, Princess Masako, is also being considered, the first 
overseas trip by the couple since they got married last June, 
the sources said. 
  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko spends [as received] the 
New Year's Day at a newly constructed residence within the 
Imperial Palace compound in central Tokyo. 
  On the opening of the New Year, the emperor said in a 
statement that he hopes disaster-stricken people will be able to 
stand firmly on their feet as quickly as possible, saying that 
the past year was full of numerous sufferings. 
  "It is highly regrettable that throughout the world many 
people are still victims of local conflicts," Emperor Akihito 
said in the statement. "On the other hand, it is gratifying to 
note signs of movement in the right direction, as in the case of 
Cambodia." 
  An unusually cool summer hit the already harsh economic 
environment and more than 400 people died or went missing in an 
earthquake and cloudbursts in Japan. 
  On the quake-battered Okushiri Island in Hokkaido, Emperor 
Akihito said in one of his waka [Japanese-style poem], "I am 
sorrowful, to see the smoke wreaths rising, from things burning 
out, 
  There along the island shore, all strewn with broken 
houses." 
  In February, the emperor and the empress will visit Iwo Jima 
and the Ogasawara islands, where the fiercest fighting in World 
War II took place. The imperial couple will make the visit to 
the islets in the Pacific Ocean, far south of Tokyo, to mark the 
25th anniversary of their return by the United States in 1969, 
Imperial Household Agency officials said. 
  Empress Michiko expressed her joy in her waka at her eldest 
son's marriage to Masako Owada, a former career diplomat. 
  "Hand in hand, may you climb together, 
  The mountain, which, now green with foliage, must be 
garmented in serene beauty," her waka said. 
  Empress Michiko, who collapsed on her 59th birthday last 
October 20 and suffered speech impairment, has partially 
recovered her ability to speak, and her condition is slowly 
getting better, doctors said.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Thaw after a long winter: Emperor Akihito's historic visit
to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conscious of the weight of history bearing down on him, Japan's Emperor
Akihito carefully delivers each of his pre-scripted public words,
punctuating the sentences with uncomfortably long silences and filtering the
emotion from a voice still ascribed supernatural qualities.
His tones will be more carefully measured than usual when he arrives in
China tomorrow for the first visit by a Japanese emperor. The humble Akihito
has made clear a sense of deep privilege that his reign should be chosen for
this journey.
The emperor's most obvious task will be to deal with the relatively recent
past, the invasion of China during the 1930s and 1940s, by delivering an
unambiguous apology and, perhaps, clearing the way for an era in which the
economic potential of the relationship will finally overcome the bitter
memories.
For the Communist party leaders who invited the emperor, the six-day visit
has a less lofty, more immediate purpose. They are still in the process of
convincing the Chinese people that the regime has the respect of the
international community, and any foreign dignitary has been much appreciated
since the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989. In these circumstances, a visit by
the emperor is all the more welcome.
The Chinese government is also keen to attract Japanese investment, a
controversial issue during the early 1980s when the revolutionary elders
drew comparisons between Japanese joint ventures in northern China and the
occupation of Manchuria in the 1930s, an occupation begun in the name of the
then Emperor Hirohito, father of Akihito.
It is a sign of the changed times that six leading trading houses, including
Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui &amp; Co yesterday announced a plan to build a
Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex in the northern Chinese province of
Liaoning. Japanese trading houses are also developing an industrial park in
the northern city of Dalian, and a Japanese trucking company has announced
plans for a transportation network in the north.
In the year of the Akihito visit, the 20th anniversary of the restoration of
Sino-Japanese relations, China will become Japan's second-largest trading
partner, behind the US, and up from fifth place a year ago. Japanese
investment in China, which rose from Dollars 349m in 1990 to Dollars 579m
last year, is likely to double this year, as manufacturers bruised by
falling profits source more of their components in low-cost and increasingly
reliable China.
The emperor is certain to laud this developing bilateral economic
relationship. But the flow of funds and an apology from the emperor are not
likely to appease a Chinese people raised on horrific tales of the 'burn
all, loot all, kill all' policies of the Japanese military during the second
world war.
Detailing the brutality of that period has served the Communist party's
interests as it highlights the 'heroic' role of revolutionary-era soldiers,
one of whom, Deng Xiaoping, is now an emperor himself in everything but
name. In deference to the Japanese emperor, Beijing has barred protests by
private groups seeking war compensation from Japan and taken much newspaper
space to explain the new, non-political role of Akihito.
Japan's foreign ministry is also emphasising the 'non-political' role of the
emperor, as enshrined in the constitution, and arguing that the event is
nothing more than a 'goodwill visit'. This interpretation is questioned by
some sceptical members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Evidence of the relationship's rich and complex history is shown in the
varied opposition from left, right and middle-ground groups in Tokyo. There
are complaints that the timing of the visit violates the emperor's
'non-political' status and about the flattering of a discredited Chinese
leadership.
Then there is concern that the exalted Japanese emperor is travelling to
'pay tribute'. Even at the height of Chinese influence over the past two
millennia, during which Japan imported a written language and the essence of
its spiritual and philosophic beliefs, no emperor crossed the sea to
Beijing.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko left Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday [10 June] morning for 
Atlanta, Georgia, to begin a 17-day, 11-city visit to the United 
States. 
  The emperor and empress are the first state guests of the 
administration of President Bill Clinton since he took office in 
January 1993. 
  In Atlanta, the emperor and empress will meet former 
President Jimmy Carter and Coretta Scott King, widow of 
assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King, government 
officials said. 
  They will be in Washington for four days from Saturday, and 
will meet President Bill Clinton, lay a wreath at Arlington 
Cemetery and visit an elementary school. 
  Clinton will hold a welcoming ceremony for the imperial 
couple Monday at the White House. 
  The couple will also travel to New York, St. Louis, Longmont 
and Denver in Colorado, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu. 
  In New York, they will meet UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus- Ghali, and in Los Angeles, former U.S. President Ronald 
Reagan. 
  In Honolulu, they will lay a wreath at the National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific but will not visit Pearl Harbor, on 
which Japan launched a devastating attack on Dec. 7, 1941. 
  The government dropped plans for the emperor to visit the 
USS 
Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from 
conservative Japanese circles, who fear the emperor would be 
expected to make an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S. 
into World War II. 
  It is the second visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S. 
Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Emperor Showa, made the 
first such visit in 1975. 
  It is also the imperial couple's first U.S. tour since the 
emperor succeeded his deceased father in January 1989, and their 
third official visit to the U.S., which they visited twice as 
crown prince and princess. 
  The couple will return to Tokyo on June 26.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Japan's past precedes emperor's US visit: Ambiguity over war
record surrounds imperial tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emperor Akihito of Japan starts his first imperial visit to the US today
with a mixture of friendship and sad wartime memories on his mind.
The emperor's 17-day tour will end with a poignant reminder of Japan's
ambiguous feelings over its wartime record. In this there is a parallel with
Germany's uncomfortable complexes over the recent D-Day landing
celebrations. For Japan the equivalent will come under the spotlight next
year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war.
As the Normandy surf erases the tracks of Europe's D-Day celebrations,
Emperor Akihito will stop in Hawaii on his way home to lay a wreath at the
US national memorial cemetery of the Pacific, the Punch Bowl.
The emperor's gesture, to the sadness of some in Washington, falls short of
the Japanese government's original plan for him to visit the USS Arizona
memorial in Pearl Harbour, a battleship sunk by the Japanese attack on
December 7 1941. That idea was dropped because of fierce objections from
Japanese right-wing politicians and commentators, many of whom believe the
1941 attack was unavoidable, maybe even justified.
Officially, the emperor is so mystically elevated that he must get less
involved in temporal affairs than his high profile counterparts in the
British or Spanish royal families.
So he politely declined last week to comment on whether or not the Pearl
Harbour attack could be justified, beyond saying that the war lay heavy on
his heart. 'It is very important to understand historical truths correctly,
but because of my position, I must refrain from touching on this kind of
subject,' he said.
Yet at the same time, Emperor Akihito has deliberately descended just a
little closer to earth than his father, Hirohito, a mark of the gradual
evolution of the world's oldest unbroken imperial dynasty.
Emperor Akihito was the first to ascend the Chrysanthemum throne, in 1989,
as a human symbol of the state, rather than a god. His father, Hirohito was
born the Son of Heaven, but was obliged by the US occupiers after the war to
renounce his divinity.
As such, Emperor Akihito appears to be trying to play a subtle, yet emotive
role in shaping Japan's attempt publicly to come to terms with its wartime
past, the prerequisite for success in its campaign to become a fully fledged
member of the international community.
In this, the Emperor is in tune with a gathering mood of wartime regret in
mainstream Japan, in line with his traditional role of embodying the
national spirit. Former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's
unprecedentedly explicit apologies over Japan's wartime record and the
recent re-writing of school textbooks to include more detail of that record
are the latest signs of this.
While feelings of atonement are on the rise, there is certainly no common
view on war history, one of the several areas in which fault lines are
appearing in Japan's famous consensus.
There is a dangerous nationalist minority, as shown by the recent gun attack
against Mr Hosokawa by a right-wing protestor, angered at his wartime
apologies. The denial two months ago by a justice minister that an infamous
wartime atrocity never happened, damaged Tokyo's increasingly vital Asian
relations. The minister resigned, but the suspicions he aroused will be hard
to soothe.
To some, the significance of Emperor Akihito's role as a public figure is
ambiguous, as shown by the response of Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a right-wing
member of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, to the aborted Pearl
Harbour visit.
'I have never heard of a US president visiting the memorial hall in
Hiroshima,' he said, drawing a temporal comparison. Yet Mr Ishihara a moment
later elevated Emperor Akihito to semi-divinity. 'The emperor is the only
priest king in the world. I think it is good for the emperor to be mystical.
If the emperor is not mystical, he will no longer be eternal,' he argues.
The emperor has in the first five years of his reign worked hard to
contribute, as a globe trotting ambassador, to Japan's temporal interests.
He has already visited the US twice in his official capacity as Crown
Prince. His father made the trip once.
Two years ago, Emperor Akihito became the first Japanese emperor to visit
China, so helping to clear the way for closer economic and diplomatic links.
At the time, he pleased the Chinese government by saying he 'deeply
deplored' the suffering caused during the Japanese occupation. He stopped
short of apologising.
Earlier this year, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko paid the first
imperial visit to the war memorial of Iwo Jima, a small Pacific island where
many thousands of US and Japanese were killed. He carefully referred, at the
time, to the dead of both sides.
Akihito hopes that the US visit will, as the one to China did, bring closer
ties. Of course he refrains from noting that his US tour is most timely,
just as a growing number of senior Tokyo government officials are getting
anxious that the strain in trade relations might spill over into political
and security relations.
Accordingly, the imperial couple have accepted a punishing schedule,
including 11 cities, starting in Atlanta today. They proceed to Washington
tomorrow, where they will be the guests of honour on Monday at the first
full state dinner of Bill Clinton's presidency, a protocol compliment that

   Reporters bowed in respect as Japan's Emperor
Akihito broke with imperial tradition Friday and held the throne's
first televised news conference since 1975.
   Akihito, seated beside Empress Michiko, began the news
conference by expressing gratitude to 10,000 people who attended
the state funeral and the hundreds of thousands who lined the
streets after his father, Hirohito, died in January at 87.
   ``What I felt while I was in personal contact with Emperor Showa
gives me, I think, an important guideline in what an emperor should
be,'' said Akihito, referring to Hirohito's posthumous name.
   Hirohito's 62-year reign _ the longest in Japanese history _
covered Japan's disastrous war in Asia and its subsequent rise to
an economic superpower.
   Because of the constitution's strict ban on his exercising
political powers, Akihito could not comment on the crisis facing
Japan's governing conservatives, plagued by money and sex scandals.
   He said he would be willing to visit China and Korea _ two
victims of Japanese aggression _ if the government decided it was
appropriate. He said the same for Okinawa, Japan's southernmost
prefecture, where many people remain bitter about the casualties
and destruction they bore in the U.S. military assault. Hirohito
never visited Okinawa after the war.
   Akihito said the Daijo-sai, an elaborate ascension rite with
strong Shinto significance, should be carried out in accordance
with the law. Many critics already argue that by its very nature it
violates the constitution's ban of state involvement in religious
affairs.
   In that mystical ceremony to be held next year, Akihito is to
have his first communion with the gods and then be reborn divine.
Media reports have estimated it could cost as much as $70 million.
The government is studying how to conduct the rite.
   Reporters representing 43 Japanese and 12 foreign news
organizations attended the news conference. Journalists were given
a detailed explanation of when to rise and bow, and who would sit
where in the palace's Stone Bridge Room, a large hall with Japanese
sliding paper doors and Western-style red carpeting.
   Sitting behind a low table draped with gold brocade cloth
embroidered with chrysanthemums, the imperial symbol, the royal
couple spoke slowly and distinctly. At times the empress, wearing a
light green dress, spoke so softly her voice was drowned out by the
clicking of cameras.
   Akihito also spoke in polite but common Japanese, unlike his
father, who often used archaic or stilted words no longer
understood by the general public.
   Akihito repeatedly stressed that his proper role is to uphold
Japan's postwar constitution, which limits his role to that of a
``symbolic'' figurehead.
   Four of the 12 main questions, all submitted weeks in advance
and subject to government approval, were about Hirohito. Along with
the main questions, several follow-ups were allowed, but by
pre-decided Japanese questioners.
   One Imperial Household Agency official requested the scheduled
time limit of 30 minutes be carefully observed, because traffic
restrictions had been set for streets on the imperial couple's way
home. The conference lasted 37 minutes.
   Akihito is the first emperor to ascend the throne under the
postwar constitution, which limits his role to mostly ceremonial
tasks. The previous constitution gave Hirohito nominal powers, and
the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name.
   The constitution also omits all references to the emperor's
special relationship with the gods of Shinto, Japan's indigenous
religion, which angers some conservatives.
   Japan's monarchy can trace its history to at least the 8th
century, and by legend until the 6th century B.C. and Emperor
Jimmu, who is said to have descended from the sun goddess,
Amaterasu.
   Michiko, rarely changing her expression of polite concentration,
said that because of her husband's heavy responsibilities she must
``make the home a place where he can...find peace and relaxation
with his family.''
   The royal couple split with the past by raising their two sons
and daughter by themselves. Akihito was raised by chamberlains from
age 3.
   Their eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, 29, is now seeking a
bride, and when asked about his growing independence, Michiko said,
``It would make me happy if he would come, even if only from time
to time, to play the viola for us.''

   Emperor Akihito today became the first
Japanese monarch to pay tribute at a monument to the 70,000 people
who died in the atomic bomb blast that devastated Nagasaki 45 years
ago.
   A steady rain fell as Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko,
bowed deeply and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a dark
granite cenotaph before the monument.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima led Akihito to the site. Motoshima was
shot in the chest in January by an ultrarightist for saying the
late Emperor Hirohito could have helped end World War II sooner and
spared Nagasaki.
   Japan surrendered six days after the Aug. 9, 1945 atomic bombing.
   Though Hirohito, now known in Japan as Emperor Showa, visited
Nagasaki for a sporting event in 1969, his son, Akihito, is the
first emperor to present flowers at the Peace Park memorial.
   As the emperor left the park, some of the 2,600 people who
attended sang ``Kimi Ga Yo,'' Japan's unofficial national anthem.
Shouts of ``Banzai,'' a wish for long life, rang out when his
20-car motorcade arrived.
   ``The emperor is from a new generation, my generation,'' said
Sachiko Nagata, a store clerk who was seven years old when the bomb
fell. ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds of the war by
coming here.''
   Police mobilized 4,000 officers to provide security for the
emperor and empress during their four-day visit to the city on the
southern island of Kyushu.
   The Roman Catholic mayor drew the ire of rightist groups with
his remarks about Hirohito. Before being shot, Motoshima received
countless death threats and lost his membership in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Japanese rightists represent a small minority but maintain a
high profile, dressing in military garb and driving through cities
in convoys of armored, painted trucks blaring march music. They are
staunchly nationalist.
   They also revere the monarchy and chastise those they believe
oppose it.

   Emperor Akihito has long lived in the shadow of his
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and the memories of Japan's
headlong march into the Pacific War that Hirohito's name evoked.
   But now that Akihito has assumed the throne left by his father's
death, many Japanese are looking to him as the symbol of a new age
- that of the generation who experienced war as children and
rebuilt the nation in peace.
   Akihito was 11 at the end of World War II, which Japanese
militarists had urged the nation into in the name of his father.
   The impact of surrender and reform under the guidance of
U.S.-led occupation forces deeply affected his youth.
   Before Akihito turned 13, Hirohito made his historic
renunciation of imperial divinity.
   Occupation troops departed Japan in 1952, leaving behind them a
democratic constitution that renounced war and defined Japan's
monarchs as ``symbols,'' not the priest-kings of bygone days.
   That imperial role seems to fit Akihito, who in one of his first
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of Hirohito in
January 1989 promised to uphold the constitution ``along with the
people.''
   Akihito, born Dec. 23, 1933, bears a strong physical resemblance
to Hirohito, and has inherited his father's short, almost frail,
build. He also has his father's passion for science, and is a
respected scholar in the study of gobies, a type of mud-sucking
fish.
   Akihito speaks fluent English and is Japan's most widely
traveled emperor. He has made official visits to 37 countries, his
first to England for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
   Reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing, Akihito is often
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more
democratically-minded, warmer person than the quiet, reclusive
Hirohito.
   He has also been far more prone to set his own precedents.
   Just three years after completing his education - Akihito was
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners - the royal heir
chose a commoner for his bride, making another break from the past.
   The woman, Michiko Shoda, was the daughter of one of the
nation's wealthiest businessmen, but their marriage in 1959 sent
shock waves through Japan's former nobility.
   To the rest of the nation, however, the wedding was welcomed as
none before. About 500,000 people lined the streets for a chance to
see Akihito and Michiko in their horse-drawn carriage during a
parade after the ceremony.
   The royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own
children, a decision prompted in part by Akihito's desire to have
the family life he was denied as a child, according to Minoru
Hamao, a former imperial chamberlain.
   Taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by
strangers, Akihito at times complained of the loneliness he felt
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes, said
Hamao, who served Akihito for two decades.
   Akihito's first child and heir, Crown Prince Naruhito, was born
Feb. 23, 1960. They have another son, Prince Akishino, and
daughter, Princess Nori.
   Though the crown prince remains single, Prince Akishino earlier
this year wed Kiko Kawashima - who, like the empress, had no royal
lineage.

<TEXT>
   When the emperor of Japan leaves his
palace in Tokyo, nothing is left to chance.
   Determined to eliminate the element of surprise, officials in
this scenic coastal city on the southern island of Kyushu have
slaved for months over preparations for the arrival Friday of
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.
   Officials are particularly nervous because the emperor is to
meet Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, who was shot in the back by a
rightist in January. The attacker was angry at Motoshima for saying
the late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   About 4,000 police officers were being mobilized to ensure the
monarch's safety.
   Highlighting the emperor's four-day stay will be a visit to an
atomic bomb memorial at Peace Park, and the 41st annual Arbor Day
Festival on Sunday.
   The emperor, who is to plant a tree and give a short address, is
scheduled to spend less than an hour at the festival, but officials
reportedly are spending $50,000 to deodorize a nearby pig farm.
   They also are planning to hang a curtain to keep the farm out of
the royal couple's sight, and have told media hoping to cover the
event by helicopter not to create any ruckus that might disturb the
animals.
   ``Sure, if the wind is right it could smell pretty bad at the
festival,'' said Yoichi Tanaka, head of general affairs for the
Nagasaki Prefectural Trade Union. ``But it's a pig farm, after all,
and there really isn't any need to try to hide that.''
   The strengthened police presence prompted a local newspaper, the
Nagasaki Shimbun, to complain in an editorial Thursday that
``excessive security'' could dampen ``the Nagasaki people's natural
desire to welcome their emperor.''
   The editorial, however, acknowledged the need for tight security
wherever the emperor goes. Leftist radicals strongly oppose the
monarchy and often have used violence to gain publicity for their
views.
   The same month that Motoshima was shot, leftists claimed
responsibility for firing projectiles that slightly damaged the
Tokyo home of the emperor's younger brother, Prince Hitachi.
   Public opinion polls indicate the overwhelming majority of
Japanese support the monarchy, but there also are painful memories
of World War II, when the emperor's name was used to inspire
Japan's troops.
   After the war, Hirohito, whom the Japanese now call Emperor
Showa, visited all of Japan's prefectures except Okinawa, a string
of southern islands where some of the war's bloodiest battles were
fought and where ill feelings toward Tokyo still linger.
   Radicals broke through security and hurled firebombs at Akihito
and Michiko when they visited Okinawa in 1975. Akihito, then crown
prince, and his wife narrowly escaped injury.

   Emperor Akihito on Friday completed a centuries-old
ceremony signifying his accession to the world's oldest hereditary
throne while protests were held against the monarchy and the high
cost of the rite.
   The Shinto ceremony, symbolizing communion with the sun goddess,
has been performed by most of Japan's emperors since at least the
7th century, and in the past was believed to give monarchs their
status as living god.
   But demonstrators across the country criticized the ritual as a
violation of the Japanese constitution's separation of church and
state and questioned the use of nearly $17 million in tax money on
the ceremony.
   Other critics of the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual,
also believe holding it indicates a desire within Japan's
conservative government to bring back the emperor worship of prewar
days.
   The rite, witnessed by only two female attendants, was held
Thursday night and then repeated before dawn Friday.
   Anti-monarchy radicals marked the beginning of the ceremony by
launching six mortar-like projectiles at an imperial villa in
Kyoto, in western Japan, police said.
   Radicals were also believed to have set fires at three Shinto
shrines and four train stations outside of the capital of Tokyo
just after midnight. No injuries were reported.
   Separate peaceful protests were staged by scholars and labor
unionists, and 1,000 Christians fasted to protest the funding of
the rite.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned since
his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne 62 years ago.
   He is also the first to assume the throne under Japan's postwar
constitution, which calls him not a god-king but a symbol of his
people's sovereignty.
   Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony Nov. 12 was viewed
by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, but no
foreigners were invited to the communion.
   During the rite, Akihito offered rice, wine and other foods from
around the country to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend
says the imperial line descended.
   The two women attendants are clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long. The
ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of a specially
built hall on the palace grounds.
   The rite is performed only once by each emperor.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were made to an altar
placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   The second ceremony was repeated after midnight in an identical
hall yards from the first one.
   Akihito performs dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace
each year, carrying on the priest-king role that has been handed
down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II.
   Hirohito, who died in 1989 at age 87, renounced the concept of
imperial divinity in 1946 at the urging of the U.S.-led occupation
forces. The country's post-war constitution specifies that the
emperor is a national symbol, and not a god-king.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam renewed his hope Saturday [26 March] for the visit to 
South Korea by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, a senior 
Imperial Household Agency official said. Kim, before departing 
for China after a three-day visit to Tokyo, extended the 
invitation again to the imperial couple as they bid farewell to 
Kim and his wife Son Myong-sun at the Akasaka Palace, said 
Kiyoshi Sumiya, the agency's grand master of ceremonies. 
  Kim told the couple during the 20-minute meeting that he 
wishes to invite them to visit South Korea at a proper time. 
  During an audience at the imperial palace on Thursday, the 
president officially invited Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko 
to visit South Korea to forge a new future-oriented 
relationship. At that time, the emperor replied the Japanese 
Government would decide on whether he will go to South Korea. 
  The visit by Japan's monarch, however, is still a sensitive 
issue in South Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule 
from 1910 to 1945. 
  During his stay in Tokyo, Kim urged Japan to work together 
to 
solve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program, which has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, 
and stressed the importance of forward-looking bilateral 
relations.

   President Roh Tae-woo today said ``no
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory'' for Japan's brutal
colonization of Korea, but that Japan's expressions of regret are
the basis for a new relationship.
   Roh returned today from a three-day trip to Japan, during which
he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese imperial
visit to South Korea.
   The invitation came after Akihito expressed regret for the
colonization of Korea nearly half a century ago, and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu extended ``honest apologies'' for Korean
suffering in the colonial period.
   Roh, upon his arrival in Seoul, said it was time for the two
countries to put the past behind them.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity, now that Japan has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes,'' he said at an airport news conference.
   During the colonial period, Japan tried to stifle Korean culture
by banning Koreans from learning their language and forcing them to
adoptJapanese names. Tens of thousands of Koreans were killed after
being drafted for the Japanese war efforts.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and Japan in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' Roh said.
   Some Koreans said Japanese measures to clear up current sore
points were more important than apologizing for the past.
   There are unresolved disputes over discrimination against
Koreans living in Japan, aid to Koreans who remain displaced after
being forcibly removed from their homeland to perform wartime labor
for Japan, and assistance to Korean survivors of the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Roh said he had asked Japan to move forward on these issues and
expressed satisfaction with the progress made so far.
   About 20,000 police had been mobilized in Tokyo to provide
security for Roh during his three-day state visit against possible
threats from extreme leftist or rightist groups. But no incidents
were reported.
   Roh's visit to Tokyo was only the second by a South Korean head
of state since the two countries established diplomatic relations
in 1965. Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, visited Japan in 1984.
   Japan and Korea have a long history of enmity and sore points
still linger from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean
Peninsula.
   The centerpiece of Roh's visit was the Thursday night state
banquet at which Akihito expressed his ``deepest regret'' for the
suffering Koreans endured at Japanese hands. Kaifu offered his
``sincere remorse and honest apologies,'' and said good relations
between Japan and Korea are a basis for peace in the region.
   Roh extended the invitation to Akihito and Empress Michiko to
visit South Korea during a short meeting with the emperor today at
the Akasaka State Guesthouse, said a palace official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``After your coronation I am sure that you will visit many
countries, and I hope that you will consider visiting South Korea
also,'' the official quoted Roh as saying.
   Akihito, who assumed the throne after the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, will not travel abroad until after his official
coronation on Nov. 12. The coronation is traditionally delayed by a
year of mourning for the deceased emperor.
   Akihito would be the first emperor to visit South Korea since
its creation after Japan's defeat in World War II.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Kaifu
had also accepted an invitation from Roh to visit South Korea at a
mutually convenient time.

<HEAD>Man Throws Smoke Bomb At Emperor's Motorcade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two people threw a smoke bomb and a firecracker at
Emperor Akihito's motorcade Sunday as it headed for the Imperial
Palace in Kyoto after another of the rites of Akihitio's
enthronement, police said.
   A bystander suffered an eye injury as the firecracker landed
among people watching the motorcade pass, said an official of the
Kyoto state police.
   The man and woman, who were arrested immediately, did not
respond to police investigators' questions, the official said.
   He said they might be connected with radical leftists who
declared in leaflets last Thursday that they would ``completely
crush'' the royal couple's visit to Kyoto and nearby Nara.
   Leftist groups oppose the monarchy and say Japan's emperor
system is a symbol of militarism.
   The smoke bomb landed in the road, pouring out smoke a minute
before the car carrying Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko reached
the spot, the official said. The car slowed, but Akihito might not
have noticed the incident, he added.

   Emperor Akihito formally assumes the world's oldest
hereditary throne Monday in lavish ceremonies that also may be an
important rite of passage for postwar Japan.
   No other monarch has ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne under the
constitution enacted in 1946.
   For the first time, a Japanese emperor is to be enthroned as
merely a national symbol, as stipulated by the constitution imposed
by the U.S. occupation after Japan's surrender in World War II.
   Most Japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial
role of their new emperor, a remarkable break with the past. The
late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, was enthroned as a living
god and was the object of fanatical devotion.
   Even the official name the government has given Akihito's reign
- Achieving Peace - reflects a desire to move away from the
turbulent times of Hirohito, who died of cancer early last year.
   The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese
public associates it most closely with Hirohito's 60-year reign. In
that period, Japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the
emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then
rose to become an economic superpower.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's
death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and
the growing of ``sacred'' rice for a coronation rite.
   During the interval, Akihito has tried to create a softer, more
open image for the often aloof royal family, insisting on fewer
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people
with the title ``san,'' a term of respect similar to Mr. or Mrs. in
English.
   Reflecting the different times in which they were raised,
Akihito is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his
father, and has pledged to ``protect the constitution along with
the people.''
   Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry a future Japanese
monarch, is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal
household, in large part by providing Akihito with a family life
similar to that of ``common'' Japanese.
   She broke tradition, for example, by making clear that her
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers.
   Although the palace remains distant to most Japanese, opinion
polls indicate it has wide public support. Few, however, still see
their monarch as a god.
   Government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age. They also have
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly month-long rites,
however, creating widespread concern that the ``new era'' might
actually represent a step backward in time.
   Royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150
nations will be in Tokyo when Akihito announces his accession on
Monday.
   The main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace, an
oasis of greenery in cetral Tokyo built in the late 19th century
on the site of a former samurai castle.
   Akihito will ascend a 20-foot-tall throne on a three-layered
dais of black lacquer, beneath an octagonal roof adorned with
golden mirrors and phoenixes.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will stand before the throne as
Akihito, in a reddish-brown kimono with a design of paulownia
trees, bamboo and mythical animals, reads an address announcing his
accession.
   Kaifu will lead the Japanese among the 2,500 guests in three
rounds of ``Banzai!'' - a traditional cheer for long life - to
conclude the 30-minute ceremony.
   Officials say Akihito will read his announcement in colloquial
Japanese, unlike Hirohito's use of stilted classical language most
Japanese cannot understand.
   To reflect the postwar constitution's emphasis on popular
sovereignty, Kaifu will lead the banzai cheers from a point level
with the throne instead of descending several steps, as his
predecessors did.
   An official in the prime minister's office told reporters a
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because ``that's the way foreign
dignitaries are received.''
   Aside from such cosmetic adjustments, Akihito's coronation is
expected to be much like those held since his great-grandfather
assumed the throne in the middle of the last century.
   In what many critics of the government see as a snub to the
constitution, about 2.5 billion yen ($17 million) in public money
will be spent on a rite steeped in Shinto, Japan's state religion
until 1945.
   In that rite, to begin 10 days after the main coronation
ceremony, Akihito will step back into the world of myth for a
``communion'' of fresh rice with the sun goddess, from whom the
imperial line is said to have descended, and all the gods of heaven
and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The Kaifu administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the late 15th century.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
Great Food Offering Ritual, is intended to restore living-god
status to Akihito and future emperors, Nobuo Ishihara, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor
assumed a divine nature. However, the government is not in a
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does
not.''
   Police have begun Japan's largest security operation, mainly
because ultra-leftist radical groups have said they will disrupt
the ceremonies. A bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last
week at a Tokyo police dormitory, killing one officer and wounding
six other people.
   Late last month, 26,000 Tokyo police officers were mobilized for
security in the capital, and at least 6,000 more have been brought
in since. Nearly 45 percent of the total coronation budget of 12.3
billion yen ($94.6 million) is being spent on security.
   A high-ranking National Police Agency official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the extraordinary security was
justified because leftist radicals ``are planning to attack the
palace with explosive rockets.''
   He said police believe one group has devised mortar-like weapons
with a range of nearly four miles.
   Along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries, including
Prince Charles of Britain and Vice Presidnt Dan Quayle, the police
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko are to ride in a convertible in the
30-minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal
residence at Akasaka Palace.
   Officials say about 10,000 officers will line the three-mile
route.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to the 
United States Takakazu Kuriyama said Wednesday [25 May] Japan 
needs to take steps to significantly reduce its current account 
surplus and implement a market-opening package to successfully 
conclude the trade framework talks with the U.S. 
  Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the 
upcoming U.S. visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, made 
the remarks at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. 
  He said Japan and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to get the 
deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides 
shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic 
and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall 
bilateral relations. 
  Tokyo and Washington also reached the accord because it 
deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade 
negotiations, he said. 
  Kuriyama said the greatest problem regarding economic and 
trade relations between Japan and the U.S. is that there is a 
lack of mutual trust. 
  Japan fears the U.S. will try to apply numerical targets to 
measure the openness of Japan's market and threaten sanctions if 
that target is not met, while the U.S. mistrusts Japan as a 
country always vowing to do something and then not, he said. 
  Opinion polls in both countries also show that trust and 
respect toward each others' nations are waning, Kuriyama said, 
attributing the reason to the failure of the framework 
negotiations in February. 
  The trade framework talks is aimed at boosting mutual 
understanding, he said. 
  Kuriyama, who is in Japan from Monday through Saturday, said 
he carried a message to Emperor Akihito from U.S. President Bill 
Clinton welcoming the imperial visit to the U.S. 
  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko are scheduled to visit 
the U.S. from June 10 to 25. 
  Touching on concerns abroad that Japan may come to possess 
nuclear weapons, Kuriyama said he tries to sweep away such 
concern by explaining Japan's nonnuclear position and the 
Japanese people's feeling on the matter. 
  The ambassador said it is impossible for Japan to possess 
nuclear weapons because an overwhelming majority of the people 
are against it and because Japan is a member of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and, therefore, has an 
international obligation not to possess nuclear weapons. 
  Also, not a single country among Japan's neighbors support 
Japan possessing nuclear weapons, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Japanese cabinet Friday 
[27 May] approved the itinerary for Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko's June 10-26 visit to the United States. 
  The ambitious schedule will take the imperial couple to 11 
cities for visits with President Bill Clinton, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and two former presidents, among 
other people. 
  The trip will also include visits to a number of historical, 
cultural and natural sites but notably will exclude a visit to 
Pearl Harbor, the site of Japan's surprise attack on U.S. forces 
there December 7, 1941. 
  The government dropped plans last week to visit the USS 
Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from 
conservative scholars and critics, who fear the emperor would be 
expected to give an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S. 
into World War II. 
  Instead, the imperial couple is scheduled to visit the Punch 
Bowl National Cemetery to lay a wreath in memory of the dead of 
the war in the Pacific. 
  The emperor and empress will embark on their trip June 10 
for 
Atlanta where they will meet former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
and the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King. 
  During a three-day stay in Washington, the imperial couple 
will be hosted as state guests by the Clintons, will attend a 
concert and reception at the Kennedy Center, and visit the 
Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. 
  Their schedule also includes a visit to the United Nations, 
a 
major league baseball game in St. Louis, a visit to the Rockies 
and a meeting with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan before 
going to Honolulu on June 10. 
  In 1960, then Crown Prince Akihito visited Pearl Harbor. The 
late Emperor Hirohito traveled to the island of Hawaii in 1975 
as part of his American tour but did not go to Pearl Harbor. 
  The imperial couple is scheduled to return to Japan on June 
26. 
  The emperor's entourage will include former Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa. The entire trip will cost some 190 million yen.

   More than 100,000 people thronged to the Imperial
Palace on Sunday to cheer newly enthroned Emperor Akihito, but
radicals set off several bombs near a shrine he is to visit.
   Akihito, Empress Michiko and other royal family members,
protected by bulletproof glass, came out onto the palace balcony
eight times during the day to greet the well-wishers, which the
Imperial Household Agency numbered at 109,800.
   Loud shouts of ``Long live the emperor!'' rang through the
palace courtyard as he finished his short statement giving thanks
to the crowds.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after his father, Emperor
Hirohito, died in January 1989. His formal enthronement Nov. 12
followed a mourning period. Enthronement-related ceremonies are to
continue into December.
   At least four explosions occurred Sunday near the Grand Shrines
of Ise, 180 miles southwest of Tokyo, which Akihito is to visit
next week, said an official of Mie Prefectural Police who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No injuries or major damage were reported in the explosions, two
of which occurred at the Ujiyamada railway station and two along a
railway track near the station.
   The emperor and empress are to use the railroad when they travel
to Ise to pray to the sun goddess on Nov. 27-28. Japan's line of
emperors is said to have descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu.
   Radicals claimed responsibility for dozens of explosions and
fires in Tokyo during Akihito's enthronement. None caused serious
injuries.
   The radicals oppose the monarchy as a remnant of Japan's prewar
imperialism.

   Japan's new imperial era was formally named
``Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for Emperor
Akihito's reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch,
the government announced today.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi announced the new name,
which will be used on calendars and official documents.
   Under a 1979 law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a new
name is assigned when a new emperor ascends Japan's 2,600-year-old
Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Emperor Hirohito died today of intestinal cancer after a 3{-month
illness. He was 87.
   His oldest son, Akihito, 55, immediately succeeded him.
   ``Heisei'' was chosen for Akihito's reign because the word,
consisting of two Chinese characters, ``includes the meaning of
achieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a statement.
   ``I think it is the most appropriate era name to reflect the
coming `new age,''' Takeshita said.
   The new era officially begins Sunday, with this year becoming
Heisei 1. The name was approved by Takeshita's Cabinet today, and
Akihito signed with a calligraphy brush to give the measure formal
effect.
   Reflecting Japan's postwar democratic constitution, private
citizens were included for the first time on the council that
recommended three names for the new era to the Cabinet. The group
also included Cabinet ministers, Imperial Household Agency officials
and scholars.
   The opinion of the new emperor was not given much weight.
   Hirohito's reign, which began Dec. 25, 1926, was known as Showa,
the era of ``enlightened peace.'' By the Japanese calendar, this
year was Showa 64.
   During the Showa era, Hirohito saw his nation plunge into World
War II and suffer history's first atomic attack, announced its
surrender, and later saw it rise to economic superpower status.
   On the death of Hirohito, Japan's longest-reigning monarch,
Akihito succeeded automatically to the throne, becoming the 125th
emperor in the world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same
family since at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C.
   In a ceremony a few hours after Hirohito died, Akihito received
three sacred treasures _ a sword, jewels and the imperial seal _
that have been handed down through the centuries.
   Other ceremonies were expected to extend over at least two years,
ending with the formal enthronement.
   A debate over naming the eras of Japan's emperors had flared
between opposition parties and the conservative Liberal Democratic
Party, which revived the era-naming clause in 1979 after it was
dropped from the postwar constitution.
   The Socialist Party and the Communist Party favor the exclusive
use of the Western calendar and charge that naming eras violates the
constitutional provision that sovereignty rests with the Japanese
people.
   The era-naming tradition was imported from China, and reflected a
belief that the sovereign controlled time itself.

  [Text] In a meeting with reporters on 31 January, Kong 
No-myong, ROK ambassador to Japan, said: "It is time to hold 
full-scale discussions on ROK-Japanese cultural exchanges based 
on personnel exchanges. Particularly in this Visit Korea Year, 
the government must reexamine its tourist policy to induce 
Japanese tourists, who patronize ROK tourism the most, and 
consider adding Chinese characters to Korean signs." 
  Ambassador Kong, who returned home temporarily to attend the 
overseas mission chiefs meeting to be held here beginning 2 
February, said that our people should abandon their "new policy 
of seclusion" [saeroun swoeguk chongchaek] for 
internationalization and opening up. 
  The following are questions and answers from the meeting 
between Ambassador Kong and reporters: 
  [Unidentified reporter] Some people point out that it is too 
early for the ROK to exchange mass culture [taejung munhwa] with 
Japan in view of the present indiscriminate infiltration of 
Japanese culture. 
  [Kong No-myong] Japanese books, video tapes, and television 
programs from satellite broadcasting services are now virtually 
opened to us. We should publicly introduce high-quality mass 
culture instead of overlooking its unlawful infiltration. An 
agreement on the general opening of mass cultural markets was 
reached in ROK-Japanese summit talks held last year, but the 
details of this issue have yet to be discussed. Accordingly, we 
have to hurry to take active measures. 
  [Reporter] What are the main agenda items to be discussed 
during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan in March? 
  [Kong] There is no pending political issue. Issues on 
economic cooperation between the ROK and Japan, such as mutual 
cooperative relations in preparation for the Uruguay Round 
treaty and methods to vitalize the ROK-Japanese Industrial and 
Technological Cooperation Committee, will be discussed. 
  [Reporter] Will President Kim meet Japanese Emperor Akihito 
when he visits Japan? Will the Japanese emperor visit the ROK? 
  [Kong] As his Japan visit is a state visit, President Kim 
will probably meet the Japanese emperor. If the Japanese 
emperor visits the ROK, it would be a significant event. The 
decision on the date of his ROK visit is a domestic affairs 
matter and must be made prudently. 
  [Reporter] Does the North Korean nuclear issue have any 
relation to the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
Japan and North Korea? 
  [Kong] Japan is willing to resume negotiations with North 
Korea whenever it wants. North Korea, however, has not yet made 
any noteworthy sign. Japan says that the resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue is not a prerequisite [chonje chogon] 
for Japanese-North Korean negotiations on establishment of 
diplomatic ties, although the nuclear issue is important.

   Emperor Akihito told his people Monday that he would
obey the constitution and work for world peace, then offered a
public farewell to his late father, Hirohito.
   Akihito's remarks, his first public statement since ascending the
Chrysanthemum Throne, came one day after his father was wrapped in a
white robe and placed in a coffin, where he will lie in state for
six weeks of funeral rites.
   More than 438,000 mournings came out in drizzling rain to honor
the dead emperor at the Imperial Palace. Akihito became emperor
shortly after Hirohito died of cancer Saturday at age 87.
   The 55-year-old Akihito spoke in clear and somber tones for four
minutes. The new Empress Michiko, 54, was on his left wearing a long
black veil. The new Crown Prince Naruhito, 28, was on his right.
   ``I pledge I will be always with the people at any time and abide
by the Japanese Constitution,'' Akihito said. The postwar
constitution bans the emperor from any role in government and limits
him to ceremonial functions, signing bills into law and serving as
``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
   ``Based on this I will exert my responsibility. I hope for
further development of the country's fortunes and world peace and
improved welfare of the human race,'' he said.
   In Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, a time for a new emperor to set a tone for his reign and
to mourn his predecessor.
   ``I sincerely mourn the late emperor's demise,'' Akihito said.
``Based on stipulations of the Japanese Constitution and the
Imperial rules, I hereby succeeded to the throne. ... Considering
its heavy duties, I recognize solemn feeling from the bottom of my
heart.''
   The ceremony, held in the main hall of the Imperial Palace,
lasted just seven minutes but was an important milestone in the
transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei, or ``achieving
peace.''
   The simple rite was attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and about 300 people from the imperial family, government,
Parliament and the judiciary.
   Hirohito will be buried Feb. 24 after lying in state for more
than six weeks, the Cabinet announced Sunday.
   Thousands of police were deployed to prevent attacks by radical
leftist and rightist groups who equate the emperor with Japanese
militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito, died after a 62-year reign that stretched from Japan's
descent into militarism and defeat in World War II to its
astonishing recovery into an economic superpower.
   Chief palace physician Akira Takagi said doctors knew in
September 1987 that Hirohito had cancer in his upper intestinal
area, but ``for various reasons'' did not announce it or tell the
monarch.
   Japanese doctors and family members often do not tell people they
have cancer as it is considered demoralizing and because of their
belief the disease is almost always fatal and the patient will
become discouraged.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said it knew the emperor had cancer
long ago. ``This was not reported because the emperor himself had
not been informed of the true nature of his ailment,'' it said.
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said the Cabinet decided
funeral costs will be shared by the government and Imperial
Household.
   Some opposition groups have warned government sponsorship of
funeral ceremonies, closely linked to Japan's native Shinto
religion, could violate constitutional separation of religion and
state.
   Hirohito is the first emperor to die under Japan's postwar
constitution. Obuchi said funeral ceremonies will be held at Tokyo's
148-acre Shinjuku Gyoen Imperial Gardens. From there, his body will
be taken in procession to an imperial mausoleum in Hachioji, 28
miles away.
   A Foreign Ministry official said dignitaries from 130 nations are
expected for the ceremony where the Akihito will preside.
   More than 60 funeral and transition rites, some simple and some
complex, are expected in coming months. Akihito's coronation will be
delayed by a year's mourning, although he automatically became
emperor when Hirohito died.
   Obuchi said security is a major concern and, ``The minister of
home affairs ... said he wants to make sure there will not be any
guerrilla incidents.''
   Hirohito officially was commander in chief of the armed forces
during World War II, which was fought by the Japanese in his name.
Most historians agree he had no direct personal role in the war, but
critics say he should have prevented Japanese aggression.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu apologized today and
Emperor Akihito expressed ``deepest regret'' for Japan's harsh
colonial rule over Korea, in statements designed to put the
nations' bitter past behind them.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo met Kaifu and the emperor on
the first day of a three-day state visit that is a carefully
scripted attempt by the two countries to move ahead as partners in
spreading peace and prosperity.
   For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its stifling 1910-1945 rule of Korea.
   At a state banquet, Roh said the two countries ``should strive
to remove the dark shadow of history,'' but Koreans had hoped for a
more direct apology from the emperor.
   In South Korea, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police today. They shouted slogans that Roh's
trip was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Feelings still run high in South Korea over Japanese colonial
abuses. Koreans had to study Japanese in school and were taught to
worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted into the
Japanese army and into forced labor in Japan. Hundreds of thousands
died in wartime service to Japan.
   Little of this is known in Japan and the history is skimmed over
in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Security was heavy for Roh's visit. About 20,000 police were
mobilized in Tokyo to prevent attacks by rightist and leftist
extremists who threatened to disrupt the event. Protest rallies
were held in Tokyo.
   After a 21-gun salute, Roh and his wife were received at Tokyo's
official guest house by Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko, Kaifu and
dozens of other Japanese officials and members of the imperial
family.
   Later, Kaifu delivered what Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe said was a stronger apology than any by previous prime
ministers and a more direct acknowledgement of Japan's
responsibility.
   Kaifu told Roh that Japan and South Korea must ``clearly and
honestly articulate the realities of events that have so
regrettably marred our past relations,'' Watanabe told reporters.
   Kaifu expressed his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies for
the fact that there was a period in our history in which Japan's
action inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of
the Korean Peninsula,'' Watanabe said.
   He quoted Roh as saying Kaifu's statement ``reflects a correct
recognition of history.''
   Watanabe said the Seoul government had been informed in advance
of what the prime minister and the emperor would say.
   At the state banquet, attention was focused on the ``okotoba,''
the emperor's speech. The Seoul government had asked that Akihito
apologize for Japan's actions in Korea and wanted him to state
Japan's responsibility.
   When Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, made the only previous
visit by a South Korean president in 1984, the late Emperor
Hirohito left the Koreans dissatisfied with a vague statement
expressing regret about the ``unfortunate past'' between the two
countries.
   Akihito never used the word apology in his brief speech _
government officials will use that word in later meetings _ but he
made a point of quoting Hirohito's words in 1984, and he said more.
   Hirohito had said: ``It is indeed regrettable that there was an
unfortunate past between us for a period in this century and I
believe it should not be repeated again.''
   Akihito went on to say, ``I think of the sufferings your people
underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about
by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   He also praised South Korea's economic advancement and said he
hoped the people of the two countries would together ``play
important roles for the peace and prosperity of the world.''
   In Seoul, officials indicated they were generally satisfied with
Akihito's speech. Vice Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said: ``I
think the Japanese government has made tremendous efforts to
satisfy our position.''
   In his reply, Roh said the ``dark period'' in relations between
the neighboring countries had been short, and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   The 21st century will be the Asia-Pacific Age, he said, and
relations between the two countries would make a difference to the
wider world.
   ``For our nations ought to combine our efforts to take a leading
role in promoting peace and prosperity through the Asia-Pacific
region, an area which will become the cradle of a new civilization
harmoniously blending things East and West,'' he said.

   For more than four decades, the bitter
memories of war and defeat clung to Emperor Hirohito. That same
ghost now haunts his son, Emperor Akihito, who on Friday paid
tribute to Nagasaki's atomic bomb victims.
   About 3,800 people stood in steady rain as Akihito, accompanied
by Empress Michiko, became the first monarch to remember the
devastating Aug. 9, 1945 attack at a monument to its 70,000 victims.
   The emperor bowed and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a
dark granite cenotaph before the Peace Park monument.
   The royal couple was greeted by loud yells of ``Banzai'' _ a
wish for long life _ when they arrived for the ceremony. And as
they left, some in the crowd sang ``Kimi Ga Yo,'' Japan's
unofficial national anthem.
   The emperor and empress later visited a hospital for patients
suffering from illness related to the bombing.
   In a statement, Akihito said that seeing the park and hospital
``renewed my thoughts for peace ... and prayers for those who still
are in pain because of the bomb's effects.''
   In Nagasaki, that pain runs deep.
   ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds by coming,''
said store clerk Sachiko Nagata, who was seven years old when the
bomb was dropped and now suffers from radiation sickness.
   ``But it took too long for him to come to this park,'' she said.
   Though the late Hirohito visited Nagasaki for a sporting event
in 1969, his son, Akihito, is the first emperor to present flowers
at the Peace Park memorial.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was the emperor's guide on the first of
his four-day visit to southern Kyushu Island. Motoshima was shot in
January by an ultra-rightist for saying Hirohito bore some
responsibilty for the war.
   Motoshima made the comment at a city assembly meeting in
December 1988, as Hirohito lay dying of the cancer that ended his
life one month later.
   The mayor also said Hirohito could have helped end the war
sooner and saved Nagasaki from the atomic bomb. Japan surrendered
six days after the attack.
   Though many Japanese share Motoshima's opinions, his candor
angered ultra-rightist groups. For more than a year, he received
death threats.
   Since the shooting, Motoshima has become a symbol of freedom of
speech.
   Though the mayor described Akihito as a ``wonderful human
being,'' he also said the monarch should strive to understand and
heal the wounds of the past.
   ``I hope the new emperor will reflect on why that war occured,
and use his position to further peace,'' Motoshima said Friday.
   Akihito's freedom to publicly reflect on the war will be tested
three days after his visit to Nagasaki ends, when he is to meet
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo in Tokyo.
   The question of how, or even if, Akihito should apologize for
Japan's colonization of Korea from 1911 to the end of World War II
has become a major political issue between the neighbors.
   Though Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has said he plans to
apologize as the elected representative of the Japanese people,
several South Korean officials have reportedly demanded Akihito
make the apology.
   But many Japanese officials say such a ``political'' statement
by the emperor would violate the spirit of Japan's constitution,
which they say aims to limit imperial power by keeping the emperor
off the political stage.

   Emperor Akihito today began the most controversial
ceremony in his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, a communion
with the mythical sun goddess from whom legend says the imperial
line descended.
   The Shinto rite has been performed by most of Japan's monarchs
since at least the seventh century, and in the past was believed to
give monarchs their status as living gods.
   But protests were held across the country against the
state-funded rite, which has been criticized by many Japanese as
violating the constitution's separation of church and state.
   Hundreds of scholars in the north and labor unionists in the
west held peaceful demontrations, while hundreds of Christians
nationwide fasted.
   About 30,000 police were assigned to security in Tokyo alone
because of the threat of violence by ultra-leftist radicals who
want to abolish the monarchy.
   As the ceremony began this evening, radicals fired six metal
projectiles from homemade mortar-like launchers at an imperial
villa in Kyoto, western Japan, police said.
   Radicals were believed responsible for a fire that destroyed a
Shinto shrine in southern Japan today, police said. On Wednesday,
anti-monarchy radicals shoveled human waste from a truck near the
Imperial Palace.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned not
as a god-king but as a symbol of his people's sovereignty. But that
has not diminished the pomp and ceremony of his multimillion-dollar
coronation.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, dressed in a swallow-tailed coat,
arrived at the palace this evening to attend the communion, one of
the final events surrounding the enthronement. Nearly 900 Japanese
dignitaries were expected to attend.
   Unlike Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony Nov. 12 that
was viewed by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, no
foreigners were invited to the communion, which is to end before
dawn Friday.
   During the rite, called the Daijosai or Great Food Offering
Ritual, Akihito offers rice, wine and other foods from around the
country to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend says the
imperial line descended.
   Only two female attendants, clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long, witness the
Daijosai. The ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of
a specially built hall on the palace grounds. The rite is performed
only once by each emperor.
   Akihito, wearing his most holy white silk robes for the rite and
surrounded by court chamberlains, slowly proceeded to the
sanctuary, led by two attendants lighting the way with torches.
   Other attendants carried a large parasol over Akihito's head, or
unrolled a rush mat before him. Yet another rolled up the mat
behind the emperor after each deliberate step.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were to be made to an
altar placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is
summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   After the first communion this evening, the ceremony was to be
repeated after midnight in an identical hall located just yards
away from the first one. Haunting court music was to be played
throughout.
   Akihito, like his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, performs
dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace each year, carrying on
the priest-king role that has been handed down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II, and opposition political parties, Christian
organizations and other groups claim the government is violation
the constitutional separation of church and state by spending an
estimated $17 million on the coronation rites.
   Hirohito, who died in January 1989 at age 87, renounced the
concept of imperial divinity on New Year's Day 1946, at the urging
of the U.S.-led occupation forces. The country's post-war
constitution specifies that the emperor is a national symbol, and
not a god-king as tradition had had it.
   Critics say repeating the Shinto rites for Akihito's
enthronement could encourage a return to the feverish
emperor-worship that helped lead the nation into war.

   In a solemn, centuries-old rite at the Imperial
Palace, Emperor Akihito acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne on
Monday, becoming the first Japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol
and not a living god.
   Leftist radicals launched 25 separate attacks aimed at
disrupting the ceremony, police said. They fired missiles at five
military bases, including a U.S. naval base, and set fires at
religious shrines and train stations. None of the attacks caused
injuries.
   A massive national security operation involving thousands of
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of
visiting dignitaries.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold Japan's modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of Japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' Akihito, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at Akihito's side was Empress Michiko,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess
Diana.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, dressed in
swallowtail coat, leading the Japanese guests in three cries of
``banzai!'' - a wish for long life. He led the cheers from a spot
level with the throne to underscore the constitution's emphasis on
popular sovereignty.
   Following the enthronement, Akihito and Empress Michiko were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car from the
Imperial Palace to the Akasaka Palace, three miles away. Officials
said nearly 10,000 police would line the route, which passes in
front of Japan's parliament.
   Akihito had begun his morning rituals by offering private
prayers at three wooden shrines inside the Imperial Palace to
announce his enthronement to the Sun Goddess and ancestors.
   Critics say the 30-minute ceremony - and a series of
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks - are based too
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for Akihito's
father and grandfather, who were enthroned as divinities.
   Japan's postwar constitution stipulates that the emperor is
simply a national symbol.
   In one controversial element of the rite, Akihito's raised dais
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess, from
whom tradition says the Japanese imperial line is descended.
Critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security. Opponents say state funding of the
ceremonies, linked to Japan's indigenous Shinto religion, violates
the constitutional separation of religion and state.
   The radical left has been particularly incensed because of the
legacy of imperial militarism in Japan.
   The projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the
military and at a base in western Tokyo, police said. No damage was
reported.
   Another missile was fired outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi,
24 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines, and in
separate incidents, two major subway lines were shut down because
of smoke.
   Among the other attacks police listed were fires that broke out
at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one less than a mile
from Akihito's residence. Two shrines were destroyed.
   The attacks, including 19 in Tokyo, caused little other damage,
police said.
   On Sunday, two bombs exploded at the house of U.S. Consul
General Gregory L. Johnson in Nishinomiya, in western Japan. Police
said they caused little damage and no injuries. It was not
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the
enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, including reinforcements from a majority
of Japan's 47 prefectures, have been mobilized for security
surrounding the rite. Security was particularly heavy around the
downtown palace.
   The government has not released the names of Japanese
dignitaries invited to the ceremony, because of fear of radical
attacks on their homes or businesses.
   Traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in
areas around the palace, but few tie-ups were reported, in part
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many
Tokyoites took advantage of the three-day weekend to leave town.
Airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, in January 1989, but a period of mourning was
observed before his formal enthronement.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner. He and the empress also raised their three
children themselves, rather than have them raised separately by
aides, as was the imperial custom.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   On Monday evening, the first of seven banquets scheduled over
five days is to be held at the Imperial Palace, with senior
Japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending.

   Former President Reagan had lunch with Emperor
Akihito today and received one of Japan's top honors _ the Grand
Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ for promoting
free trade and friendship with Japan.
   The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in
central Tokyo was the first meeting between the two men since
Akihito succeeded his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, in January
and since Reagan retired to California.
   ``I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded,'' Reagan
said.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master of
Ceremonies Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palace
officials said. Nancy Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and Ambassador
Michael Armacost also attended the ceremony and luncheon, they said
on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October 1987 when
they made an official visit to the United States.
   Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for
promoting peace and friendship with Japan and for working to
protect the free trade system during his eight years in office,
officials said. The last and only other U.S. president to receive
the honor was Dwight Eisenhower.
   Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation of
Fujisankei Communications Group and the Japanese government, met
with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held by
Kaifu in his honor.
   At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted the
deepening of bilateral relations during his years in office and
warmly congratulated Reagan on his award.
   ``I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and
downs. Even among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues
which need careful and candid evaluation,'' Reagan said, alluding
to often rocky trade issues.
   Reagan and Fujisankei have refused to confirm reports he will
receive about $2 million for his appearances on television and at
charitable events during his Oct. 20-28 stay.
   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, has said it was
spending $7 million on the visit. On Sunday, the group sponsored a
gala benefit concert for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
attended by over 10,000 people.
   Like its chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of Fujisankei's media
outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism.
   At the time of Hirohito's death on Jan. 7, the Fuji TV network
generally carried less critical views of Japan's imperial system.

   Emperor Akihito and his mother, the empress
dowager, will be the only heirs of the late Emperor Hirohito in
order to keep together the royal treasures, news reports said today.
   Kyodo News Service said the Imperial Household Agency asked nine
other imperial successors to waive their rights of inheritance.
   The palace declined comment, however, saying a public
announcement now would be premature.
   Hirohito, Japan's emperor for 62 years, died Jan. 7 at age 87.
Akihito, his eldest son, succeeded him and Hirohito's wife, Nagako,
became empress dowager.
   Under Japanese law, legal heirs to property must claim their
inheritance within six months of the owner's death. This would mean
by July 7 in Hirohito's case, and the tax administration office
must announce the claims within four months.
   It will be the first public accounting of the imperial family's
private finances since shortly after World War II. The government
reported then that the imperial family's wealth amounted to the
equivalent of about $113,000.
   Such things as three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and
jewels handed down from emperor to emperor _ are tax-exempt, and
the family owns no land. But bank savings, stocks and bonds under
Hirohito's name and paintings are subject to inheritance taxes.
   Kyodo said the palace will donate the art works to the
government and continue to use them as government-owned imperial
property. The land where the imperial family lives is owned by the
government.
   The imperial family, formerly exempt from taxes, was the
wealthiest family in Japan until U.S. forces occupying this country
after the war forced it to give up most of its property. Its
wealth, including real estate, stocks and bonds, reportedly
amounted to about $29 million before it surrendered most of its
holdings to the government.

  Soglo arrived in Japan on Monday for a four-day visit to 
seek 
Japanese political and economic support for his nation. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told Soglo on Monday that 
Japan will give the African republic 1.11 billion yen in 
economic assistance. 
  Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is

   Emperor Akihito formally assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne on Monday in rites steeped in ancient tradition but
reflecting the U.S.-imposed postwar constitution that denies him
the divine status of his predecessors.
   Despite massive security precautions, leftist extremists opposed
to the monarchy launched attacks on military bases, train stations
and Shinto shrines as the late Emperor Hirohito's son assumed the
throne, which is said to date from 660 B.C.
   Police counted more than 32 guerrilla incidents Monday morning,
most in Tokyo. None of the attacks appeared to cause injuries, but
they disrupted several train lines, and a bomb exploded near a
police dormitory, setting two empty houses on fire, police said.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold Japan's modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of Japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' Akihito, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at Akihito's side was Empress Michiko,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess
Diana.
   Akihito expressed deep ``love and respect'' for his father, who
died in January 1989 after a 62-year reign that encompassed Japan's
crushing defeat in World War II and spectacular rise as the world's
No. 2 economic power.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war. Under
the new constitution, Akihito becomes the first of Japan's 125
emperors, including those listed only in legend, to take the throne
as a mere mortal and not a priest-king.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, wearing a
morning suit instead of traditional garb, leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``banzai!'' - a wish for long life.
   He led the cheers from a spot level with the throne to
underscore the constitution's emphasis on popular sovereignty.
   Earlier Monday, Akihito had announced his ascension to the sun
goddess and his ancestors in private prayers at wooden shrines
inside the palace.
   A blimp floated overhead with a huge sign urging Tokyo residents
to call with any information about suspected terrorist activity.
   Following the enthronement, Akihito and Empress Michiko were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car to the
Akasaka Palace, three miles away. Officials said nearly 10,000
police would line the route, which passes in front of Japan's
parliament.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese
were not interested in the enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, many dressed in full riot gear and
backed by water cannon, were deployed in Tokyo to guard the
ceremonies but could not stop a series of attacks throughout the
city.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western Tokyo, the Defense Agency reported. Police
reported a similar attack outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, 25
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three Tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one
less than a mile from Akihito's residence, destroying two.
   Radicals and other critics say the coronation and its
accompanying rites are based too closely on the traditional
religious rituals used for Akihito's father, whose name was invoked
by the militarists who launched the Pacific War.
   Opponents say state funding of the ceremonies, linked to Japan's
indigenous Shinto religion, violates the constitutional separation
of religion and state.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
but a period of mourning was observed before his enthronement.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner.
   He and the empress also raised their three children themselves,
rather than have them raised separately by aides, as was the
imperial custom.

   Emperor Akihito ascended to the world's oldest
hereditary monarchy today, the first in a legendary 2,600-year-old
line of emperors to be enthroned as a national symbol rather than a
living god.
   Leftist extremists, who consider the institution of emperor an
unconstitutional relic of Japan's militarist past, attacked
military bases, train stations and Shinto shrines in protest.
   Police counted at least 34 guerrilla attacks timed to coincide
with the coronation of the late Emperor Hirohito's 56-year-old son.
None appeared to cause any injuries.
   A record 37,000 police had been mobilized to guard the
ceremonies as well as the attending dignitaries from 158 countries,
including Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles
and Princess Diana.
   For his coronation, Akihito wore a red-brown silk kimono and hat
of ancient design and sat on an elaborate lacquered throne in front
of an Imperial Palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying
bows and swords.
   He vowed to ``discharge my duties as symbol of the state and of
the unity of the people'' under Japan's postwar constitution, which
fundamentally restructured the monarchy.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war, but
Akihito becomes the first of Japan's 125 emperors, including those
listed only in legend, to take the throne as a mere mortal and not
a priest-king.
   He said he would perform his role in the same spirit as his
father, who ``shared joys and sorrows with the people at all
times'' during a 62-year reign that encompassed both the
devastation of World War II and Japan's dramatic recovery.
   Empress Michiko, dressed in a multicolored gown, her face
painted white, sat motionless on her own throne at Akihito's side
throughout the 30-minute ceremony.
   The ritual ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu standing
stiffly before Akihito in a morning suit and leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``Banzai'' - he traditional wish for long
life.
   He led the cheers from a point level with the base of the
throne, to underscore the constitution's stress on popular
sovereignty.
   A 21-gun salute blasted from an adjacent park.
   The ancient, mystical enthronement rites are said to date back
to 660 B.C.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko later left the palace grounds in an
open Rolls Royce, ringed by dozens of police motorcycles and waving
and smiling to cheering crowds. They had changed to formal Western
clothes.
   Many of the estimated 110,000 people along the three-mile parade
route to Akasaka Palace, the couple's home, yelled ``Banzai'' and
waved national flags as the 44-car parade passed. Nearly 10,000
police lined the route.
   There was one shaky moment, however, when firecrackers popped as
the emperor's car passed by. Police with German shepherds rushed in
and arrested several people, some of whom handed out leaflets
calling Hirohito a war criminal.
   Leftist radicals who want the imperial house abolished made
themselves heard all across the capital. Police said they arrested
about a dozen of the several thousand protesters who held
anti-imperial rallies around Tokyo.
   In one park, hundreds of masked members of the ultra-leftist
Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction, chanted ``Smash the enthronement
ceremony!''
   One man attempted to commit hara-kiri, or traditional suicide by
disembowelment, in front of the Imperial Palace but was rushed to a
hospital, police said. There were no immediate details on his
condition or motivation.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western Tokyo, the Defense Agency reported. Police
reported another attack outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, 24
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three Tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one
less than a mile from Akihito's residence, destroying two.
   Japanese flags lined the main streets in the Ginza shopping
district, where cars and trucks painted with rightist slogans
paraded. Speakers blared ``Long live the emperor,'' as riot police
stood by.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. Long lines of people queued in front of movie
theaters.
   One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese were not
interested in the enthronement.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after the death of Hirohito
in January 1989, but his enthronement was delayed until after a
period of mourning.

<HEAD>President Roh Seeks Trip to Japan Despite Diplomatic Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo will push ahead
with his scheduled visit to Japan, his office said today, despite
an escalating diplomatic row over Japan's apology for its colonial
rule of Korea.
   South Korea, however, may develop some retaliatory measures if
Japan rejects its demand for a clear-cut apology for wrongs
committed under Japan's 1910-45 rule, presidential spokesman Lee
Soo-jung said. He did not elaborate.
   Roh has been under public pressure to call off his trip next
week to Tokyo, following controversial remarks by Japanese
governing party leaders asking Japanese Emperor Akihito not to make
an open, strong apology. But Lee said the president would not
reconsider the three-day visit, beginning May 24.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Tuesday he plans to
apologize to Roh about the colonial rule but would not say whether
the emperor should.
   Elderly Koreans have staged daily protests outside the Japanese
Embassy to demand an apology and compensation for Japan's wartime
acts. The protesters, many related to Koreans who were killed
during World War II, have asked Roh to cancel his visit. During the
war, Japan drafted hundreds of thousands of Koreans as soldiers and
forced laborers.
   ``Japan, the war criminal, must apologize, compensate,'' a dozen
protesters shouted today during a sit-in outside the embassy, which
was guarded by riot troopers wearing helmets and carrying shields.
Police did not intervene.
   The matter is delicate for the Japanese, touching on the nature
of the emperor's role under the postwar constitution and recalling
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late Emperor
Hirohito had for Japan's wartime actions.
   Akihito succeeded to the throne after Hirohito died in January
1989.
   Roh's trip had been delayed twice by issues involving the legal
status of some 700,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan. Japan agreed
early this month to provide greater legal protection for Koreans.

   In Japan's clearest effort to grapple with its
militaristic past, Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
on Thursday acknowledged the suffering that Japanese colonial rule
inflicted on Koreans.
   The apology come 45 years after a defeated Japan relinquished
its control of the Korean peninsula. The issue of acknowledging
Japan's past exposed bitter memories in both countries, prompting
demonstrations and arson attacks.
   In a palace banquet for visiting South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo, Akihito went beyond a previous imperial statement and said
he felt the ``deepest regret'' for the pain Japan's colonial rule
caused the Korean people. Earlier Thursday, Kaifu expressed
``sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for Japanese actions that
``inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the
Korean peninsula.''
   Kaifu's apology was the most clear-cut ever by a Japanese prime
minister, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said. A similar
statement of remorse also was expected to be made by Parliament,
where Roh was to give an address Friday.
   For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its 1910-1945 rule of Korea. The lack of an
explicit apology had been a major obstacle to improving the two
neighbors' relations.
   Roh, replying to Akihito, said the ``dark period'' in
Japanese-Korean relations had been short and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   In South Korea, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police Thursday. They shouted slogans that
Roh's trip to Japan _ only the second by a South Korean head of
state _ was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Under colonial rule, Koreans had to study Japanese in school and
were taught to worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted
into the Japanese army and into forced labor in Japan. Hundreds of
thousands died in wartime service to Japan.
   Little of this is known in Japan, and the history is skimmed
over in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Before the trip, Kaifu had offered to make a strong statement,
but South Koreans sought a personal apology from Akihito because
Japan's military adventures in the early part of this century often
were made in the name of his father, the late Emperor Hirohito.
   The demands sparked a debate within Japan's government over
whether a strong apology by the emperor would violate
constitutional restraints on his political role.
   In a carefully orchestrated compromise, both governments seemed
to hope that whatever was lacking in the Akihito statement would be
made up for by Kaifu and the Parliament.
   Akihito quoted the words Hirohito used in 1984 during the state
visit of Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan: ``It is indeed
regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a
period in this century, and I believe it should not be repeated
again.''
   That statement, the closest Hirohito ever came to a public
apology, was strongly criticized in South Korea as being too vague
and for not saying who was to blame.
   But Akihito went on to say: ``I think of the sufferings your
people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   Underscoring the importance of Roh's visit, the 150-guest
banquet was the largest at the palace since Akihito assumed the
throne after his father's death. Akihito broke with tradition by
welcoming Roh outside the banquet hall. As they entered the hall,
musicians played ``Hand in Hand,'' theme song of the 1988 Seoul
Olympics.
   Foreign Minister Choi Ho-jung, who accompanied Roh to Tokyo,
indicated that Japan's apology fell short of Seoul's expectations
but said he believed Japan did ``its best to receive President Roh
with courtesy.''
   Extreme leftists vowed to disrupt the visit, which they call the
first step toward reviving the militarist Japanese empire.
Rightists, who worship the emperor, have strongly opposed calls for
Akihito to apologize.
   Police mobilized 20,000 officers to guard against radical
attacks. Though they said about 300 leftist radicals demonstrated
in two separate Tokyo rallies, no arrests or incidents were
reported.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on Thursday [24 March] officially invited Emperor 
Akihito and Empress Michiko to visit South Korea to forge a new 
future-oriented relationship, the Imperial Household Agency 
said. "I would like to promote relations between South Korea 
and Japan from a forward-looking, future-oriented view," a 
senior Imperial Palace official quoted Kim as saying. 
  Bilateral relations are still overshadowed by Japan's 
colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and 
anti-Japanese sentiment continues to run high. 
  Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, had a 25-minute audience 
with the imperial couple in an "overall pleasant atmosphere," 
Kiyoshi Sumiya, grand master of ceremonies, said. 
  "I think it would benefit our friendly neighborly relations 
if we could welcome the emperor and the empress in South Korea. 
I would like to seize this good opportunity to offer an 
invitation," Kim told the imperial couple. 
  The emperor replied it is the Japanese Government's decision 
on whether he goes abroad. 
  In an interview ahead of the visit, Kim, who was elected 
last 
year to a single five-year term, said he believes he will be 
able to receive the emperor in Seoul during his term in office. 
  The emperor told Kim it is important that both nations 
deepen 
their exchange while reflecting on history and respecting each 
other's cultures. 
  During colonization, Koreans were forbidden from speaking 
Korean in public and had to adopt Japanese names. In addition, 
Japan's forced recruitment of tens of thousands of Korean women 
for wartime military brothels has refueled bitter memories.

Former President Ronald Reagan had lunch with Emperor Akihito today and 
received one of Japan's top honors -- the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of 
the Chrysanthemum -- for promoting free trade and friendship with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo was the 
first meeting between the two men since Akihito succeeded his father, the late 
Emperor Hirohito, in January and since Reagan retired to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded," said Reagan, who is 
earning $2 million in speaking fees during his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master of Ceremonies 
Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palace officials said. Nancy 
Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and Ambassador Michael Armacost also attended the 
ceremony and luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October, 1987, when they made an 
official visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for promoting peace and 
friendship with Japan and for working to protect the free trade system during 
his eight years in office, officials said. The last and only other U.S. 
President to receive the honor was Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation of Fujisankei 
Communications Group and the Japanese government, met with Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held by Kaifu in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted the deepening of 
bilateral relations during his years in office and warmly congratulated Reagan 
on his award. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and downs. Even 
among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues which need careful and 
candid evaluation," Reagan said, alluding to often rocky trade issues.

  [Text] Paris, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and French President Francois Mitterrand agreed 
Wednesday [4 May] that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program threatens the global move toward preventing the spread 
of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear powers. 
  The two leaders shared the understanding during a two-hour 
meeting at the French Presidential Palace, Japanese officials 
said. 
  The meeting took place after Hata arrived in Paris from Rome 
as part of his European tour, which will also take him to 
Germany and Belgium. 
  They said Hata told Mitterrand that the North Korean nuclear 
issue "is a serious problem that threatens the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime, as well as undermines the security of 
the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Hata also said, "we must counter the threat in solidarity, 
while keeping the channels for (diplomatic) dialogue open." 
  Mitterrand agreed with Hata's view, the Japanese officials 
said. 
  On China, Hata told Mitterrand, "it is important for China 
to 
provide greater transparency in its activities in the military 
field...and it is crucial for us to urge China to demonstrate a 
positive response in the field of human rights." 
  Hata also told Mitterrand, "Japan wants to step up its 
cooperation with France in various fields from now on" to build 
a new international order to secure global peace in addition to 
strengthening the capabilities of the United Nations, the 
officials said. 
  Mitterrand replied, "I agree with your view. The two nations 
can build up a stronger relationship of cooperation." 
  The French president expressed his interest in enhancing 
cooperation, particularly in extending economic assistance to 
such areas as Indochina and Africa. 
  Hata expressed gratitude for France's endorsement for 
Japan's 
bid to secure a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, of 
which France is one of the five permanent members. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his support 
for 
Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN decision-making 
body during his visit to Tokyo in March. 
  Mitterrand, however, stopped short of addressing the issue, 
according to the Japanese officials. 
  The French leader expressed his nation's readiness to 
welcome 
Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife Michiko, who are slated to 
visit France in October. 
  "We are looking forward to meeting the emperor and empress," 
the president was quoted as saying. 
  Hata replied, "the emperor is also looking forward to the 
visit." The royal couple is slated to visit France and Spain on 
a two-week trip that will begin in late September.

   President Roh Tae-woo said Saturday
that Japan's apologies for its brutal colonial rule might not
satisfy all South Koreans, but he urged them to look to the future,
not the past.
   Roh returned from an emotional three-day visit to Japan aimed at
beginning a new partnership between the Asian neighbors. At its
conclusion, he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese
imperial visit to South Korea.
   During Roh's visit, Akihito expressed ``deepest regret for the
sufferings and pain'' Japan inflicted on Korea during its colonial
rule from 1910 to 1945. Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
extended his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies.''
   Kaifu's apology was Japan's clearest statement of regret ever
over its military past. But Roh acknowledged many South Koreans
would be dissatisfied with it.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and Japan in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' Roh said at a news
conference at Seoul's airport.
   During much of the colonial period, Koreans were forced to speak
Japanese, use Japanese names and worship the late Japanese Emperor
Hirohito, Akihito's father. Many Koreans died after being
conscripted into Japan's army or in dangerous jobs as laborers in
Japan.
   Before leaving Tokyo on Saturday, Roh said Akihito's words of
regret ``were very significant,'' and said the emperor and Kaifu
had ``expressed a common awareness about this unfortunate period
between our two countries.''
   ``With this, I feel that myself and the people of my country
feel we can put the unfortunate period of our history behind us,''
Roh said.
   In Tokyo, about 20,000 police had been mobilized to guard
against threats to Roh from both rightist and leftist groups, but
no incidents were reported.
   During a brief visit to Osaka in western Japan on his way home,
about 30 leftists demonstrated peacefully against Roh's visit,
police said.
   Roh's visit had sparked far bigger protests in South Korea.
Before he left for Japan, radicals and human rights groups
demonstrated almost daily, demanding that he cancel his visit.
   One man slashed his belly with a knife in front of the Japanese
Embassy in Seoul in protest.
   Roh said after his return that he believed Kaifu's and Akihito's
statements of regret were sufficient and urged that they be
accepted.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity now that Japan has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes, reflected on them and apologized,'' he said.
   ``With that, I believe we must now forge a new era of
neighborliness and friendship,'' he added.
   Some sore points remain unresolved, including discrimination
against Korean residents in Japan and health care for Korean
survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Roh made clear that he had asked Japan to move forward on those
issues, but he said he was satisfied with the progress so far.
   ``If we are to promote the peace and prosperity of northeast
Asia and also usher in an Asian-Pacific age by the 21st century, we
should advance friendly cooperation with Japan, our next-door
neighbor,'' he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji had separate discussions 
with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 
furthering Sino-Japanese relations and other issues here today. 
  According to a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jiang 
praised Hosokawa for focusing seriously on bilateral ties and 
for actively promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. He also 
expressed the conviction that Hosokawa's visit will be useful in 
enhancing the bilateral ties. 
  He noted that the rapidly developing Sino-Japanese ties over 
the past 22 years following the normalization of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries have entered into a new 
period of "all-round development." 
  Jiang said that China and Japan have their own strong and 
weak points; therefore they are partners in cooperation. "So 
long as the leaders of our two countries have a clear 
understanding on this, the two sides can surely foster a long 
and sustained relationship of mutually beneficial cooperation," 
he stressed. 
  He also believed that it is a historical trend for China and 
Japan to live in peace from generation to generation. 
  Discussing international issues, Jiang said that under the 
turbulent international situation of today, a rare chance has 
emerged in Asia, which now enjoys relative stability and fast 
economic development. 
  He continued that as the 20th century is approaching to an 
end, the leaders of the Asian countries must answer a question 
of major importance, namely, what kind of Asia will they take 
into the 21st century. 
  Jiang said that the Chinese leaders, while concentrating on 
domestic issues, will foster better coordination and cooperation 
with Japan. 
  China, Japan and other Asian countries should make joint 
efforts to keep long-term stability in the continent and to 
establish a new international order under which countries, big 
or small, rich or poor, can live in peace and deal with each 
other on an equal footing, Jiang said. 
  This is Hosokawa's second meeting with Jiang, following 
their 
meeting in Seattle last November. 
  Hosokawa told Jiang that his meetings with Premier Li Peng 
and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji show that the two sides have 
identical or similar views on many issues. 
  He said that he was confident that Japan and China will 
build 
a forward-looking relationship of long-term and stable 
cooperation. 
  Hosokawa conveyed the Japanese emperor's invitation for 
Jiang 
to visit Japan. Jiang thanked the emperor and asked Hosokawa to 
convey his good wishes to the emperor and empress. 
  Zhu Rongji met with Hosokawa and his wife and hosted a 
luncheon in their honor earlier today, thanking the Japanese 
Government and people for their hospitality accorded him during 
his recent visit to Japan. 
  Hosokawa said that he was very pleased to meet Zhu again.

   WASHINGTON _ President Reagan mourned the death of Emperor
Hirohito of Japan, saying he played ``a truly heroic role'' in
ending World War II hostilities between his country and the United
States.
   ``On behalf of the people and government of the United States, we
extend our deepest condolences to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor,
to the Imperial family, and to the People of Japan,'' the president
said in a statement released by the White House shortly after the
annoucement of the emperor's death Friday.
   Reagan said the emperor's 62-year reign ``spanned one of the most
tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the
history of mankind _ an age of unprecedented economic collapse, a
most vicious war, astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic
political and social changes throughout the world.''
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end and leading the Japanese people through a period
of reconstruction and reconciliation that has resulted in both the
prosperity the Japanese know today and in the close relations our
two nations and peoples now enjoy,'' Reagan said.
   The president recalled the late emperor had visited the United
States in 1975, and that he and his wife Nancy had ``enjoyed several
meetings with him, most recently in Tokyo'' in 1986. The statement
also noted the first couple had entertained the former Crown Prince
Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko at the White House in 1987.
   ``While we mourn the passing of His majesty, we shall long
remember him for his contributions which strengthened the United
States-Japan relationship and set a future course of continued close
and friendly relations,'' the president said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that because there
will be a waiting period before Hirohito's funeral, the decision on
whom to send would be up to the incoming administration of George
Bush.
   Bush sent letters of condolence to both Hirohito's son, Akihito,
and the prime minister of Japan, Noboru Takeshita, said Sean Walsh,
a press aide in the vice president's office.
   Bush met the late emperor once on a 1982 visit to Japan. Akahito
visited Bush at his home during a trip to the United States last
year. The two played tennis together on that occasion.
   Bush's office did not release the text of the letters. Walsh said
Bush conveyed ``his sincerest condolences'' to Akahito on the death
of his father, and expressed similar sentiments in the letter to the
prime minister.

   Emperor Hirohito, who held divine status until
Japan's defeat in World War II and endured to reign for 62 years,
died Saturday, the government's chief spokesman announced. He was 87.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenzo Obuchi said the emperor died at
6:33 a.m. (4:03 a.m. EST Friday).
   The frail monarch had been in deteriorating health since Sept.
19, when he vomited blood, and had received numerous blood
transfusions since then to counteract internal hemorrhaging.
   The palace said the emperor died of intestinal cancer.
   Kyodo News Service said Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's
oldest son, immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   It said Akihito was taking over three sacred imperial treasures
that symbolize the throne and have been handed down through
generations of emperors.

   In a solemn, centuries-old rite at the Imperial
Palace, Emperor Akihito formally accedes to the Chrysanthemum
Throne on Monday, becoming the first Japanese monarch enthroned as
a symbol and not a living god.
   Leftist radicals launched a series of attacks aimed at
disrupting the ceremony. They fired missiles at five military
bases, including a U.S. naval base, and were blamed with setting
fires at religious shrines and train stations. None of the attacks
caused injuries.
   A massive national security operation involving thousands of
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of
visiting dignitaries.
   Clad in ancient court costume, seated atop an elaborate
lacquered platform under a curtained canopy encrusted with gold
phoenixes and circular mirrors, Akihito will face a courtyard lined
with ceremonial banners.
   Next to him on a smaller platform will be Empress Michiko. Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu will lead the 2,500 guests in three cheers
of ``Banzai!'' - ``May you live ten thousand years!''
   Akihito began his morning rituals by offering private prayers at
three wooden shrines inside the heavily guarded Imperial Palace to
announce his enthronement to the Sun Goddess and ancestors.
   Critics say the 30-minute ceremony - and a series of
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks - are based too
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for Akihito's
father and grandfather, who were enthroned as living gods.
   Under Japan's postwar constitution, the emperor is simply a
national symbol.
   In one controversial element of the rite, Akihito's raised dais
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess, from
whom tradition says the Japanese imperial line is descended.
Critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security. Opponents say state funding of the
ceremonies, linked to Japan's indigenous Shinto religion, violates
the constitutional separation of religion and state.
   The radical left has been particularly incensed because of the
legacy of imperial militarism in Japan.
   The projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the
military and at a base in western Tokyo, police said. No damage was
reported.
   Another missile was fired outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi,
24 miles southwest of Tokyo. The base was apparently the target of
that failed attack.
   Three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines, and in
separate incidents, two major subway lines were shut down because
of smoke.
   Fires also broke out at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including
one less than a mile from Akihito's residence. Police said all were
believed started by extremists.
   No injuries were immediately reported, but tw shrines were
destroyed.
   On Sunday, two bombs exploded at the house of U.S. Consul
General Gregory L. Johnson in Nishinomiya, in western Japan. Police
said they caused little damage and no injuries. It was not
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the
enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, including reinforcements from a majority
of Japan's 47 prefectures, have been mobilized for security
surrounding the rite. Security was particularly heavy around the
downtown palace, where Akihito began his morning rituals by
offering private prayers to the sun goddess at a wooden shrine.
   Dignitaries from 158 countries expected to attend the ceremony
include Vice President Dan Quayle, United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly I.
Lukyanov and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
   The government has not released the names of Japanese
dignitaries invited to the ceremony, because of fear of radical
attacks on their homes or businesses.
   Traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in
areas around the palace, but few tie-ups were reported, in part
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many
Tokyoites took advantage of the three-day weekend to leave town.
Airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, in January 1989, but a period of mourning was
observed before his formal enthronement.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner. He and the empress also raised their three
children themselves, rather than have them raised separately by
aides, as was the imperial custom.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   On Monday evening, the first of seven banquets scheduled over
five days is to be held at the Imperial Palace, with senior
Japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending.

   Kiko Kawashima is a college student living in a
small apartment with her parents, but come Friday, Japan's
modern-day Cinderella will call a palace her home.
   In Japan's first royal wedding in six years, the 23-year-old
Miss Kawashima is to wed Emperor Akihito's youngest son, Prince
Aya, who is 24 and second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   The wedding will be lavish _ the government has allotted nearly
$1 million _ and filled with traditions dating back more than 1,000
years.
   But to a nation that only last year buried Emperor Hirohito,
whose 62-year reign spanned a turbulent period of militarist
expansionism and economic reconstruction, the wedding also is being
hailed as the first taste of a new era.
   As far as the clearly smitten Japanese media are concerned,
Prince Aya could not have chosen a better mate than ``Kiko-san,''
who is only the second commoner to marry into the imperial family.
   Aya's mother, Empress Michiko, became the first in 1959 when she
married Emperor Akihito, who was then crown prince. Akihito
ascended the throne immediately after Hirohito's death on Jan. 7,
1989.
   Most of Japan's major television networks will broadcast live
coverage of the ceremony and related events. The wedding is
scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and will be followed by several other
ceremonies, so television coverage will likely last well into the
night.
   Along with the countless comparisons to Cinderella, Miss
Kawashima has been dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because of her
relatively humble abode _ faculty housing on the campus of Tokyo's
Gakushuin University.
   At Gakushuin, Miss Kawashima is working on her master's degree
in psychology. Her father, Tatsuhiko, teaches economics there.
   The former peer's school boasts much of the imperial family and
former nobility among its alumni. It is where Miss Kawashima and
her prince met in 1985, when he too was a Gakushuin student.
   Since the engagement of Aya and Miss Kawashima was formally
announced in September, flocks of reporters often have staked out
the Kawashimas' three-bedroom apartment.
   They have tagged along as Miss Kawashima did her final
pre-wedding shopping, and even as she made a rare appearance at a
bowling alley. Her score was reportedly about 100.
   Though the Japanese and their media generally treat the monarchy
with great deference, photographing Miss Kawashima's mother hanging
the family laundry out to dry is apparently acceptable, as is
broadcasting it to millions of television viewers.
   Aya, who returned Thursday from two years of zoology studies at
England's Oxford University, has managed to avoid most of the media
blitz.
   Palace officials say the somber, 15-minute wedding will begin
with the sound of shrill classical Japanese music. The young
couple, attended by several chamberlains, will slowly walk down a
corridor to a wooden shrine at the Imperial Palace.
   After Aya makes his vows to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom
legend says the imperial family descended, the couple will sip rice
wine to seal their marital bond.
   Later in the day, they are to visit Akihito and Michiko to
announce their marriage. In keeping with tradition, the emperor and
empress will not be among the guests invited to the ceremony itself.
   The guest list, however, does include such dignitaries as Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and the heads of the judicial and
legislative branches of government.
   The emperor is to bestow upon Aya a new title to mark his
marriage and creation of an independent household. Aya's given name
is Fumihito, but Japanese only rarely refer to him by that.
   Following three days of receptions, and three more days to rest,
Aya and Miss Kawashima will travel to the Grand Shrines of Ise, the
central place of worship for believers of Shinto, Japan's
indigenous religion.
   Before returning to Tokyo, where they will pay their respects at
Hirohito's mausoleum, they also will visit the tomb dedicated to
Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, who according to legend began his
reign in 660 B.C.
   Police plan to mobilize 9,000 officers to guard against leftist
attacks, and the public will have little chance to see the royal
couple in person.
   But a short ``parade,'' from the Imperial Palace to the Akasaka
Palace where the emperor and empress reside, is planned.

<HEAD>Koreans Mount Daily Protest at Japanese Embassy</HEAD>

   South Korean protesters held a sit-in
in front of the Japanese Embassy on Friday for the fifth
consecutive day to demand an apology by Japan's emperor for
colonial rule of Korea.
   Some of their placards asked President Roh Tae-woo to cancel his
three-day visit to Japan next week. Roh has been under mounting
public pressure to put off the visit unless Emperor Akihito makes
such an apology.
   The protesters, relatives of Koreans drafted by Japan and killed
during World War II, were demanding an apology and compensation for
Japan's wartime acts.
   The protest began Monday, when about a dozen people, all more
than 50 years old, sat on the ground about 15 yards from the
embassy's main gate, shouting ``Akihito, apologize!'' About 60 riot
police guarded the embassy, but there have been no arrests.
   The protesters gather in the morning and stay several hours
after nightfall, reading statements and chanting slogans.
   Minor scuffles have broken out only when the protesters
screaming slogans try to run after cars carrying Japanese
diplomats. Some irate protesters hurled eggs on Thursday.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, who died in January 1989, said in
1984 he sincerely regretted that there was an unfortunate past
between the two countries.
   However, South Korean officials have said the apology was
unclear to the Korean people.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan has said he will apologize
to the Korean people next week. But Japanese officials have
resisted calls for Akihito to make a formal apology, saying the
emperor, the symbol of the Japanese state, should not be used for
political purposes.
   Anti-Japanese sentiment is strong among many elderly Koreans who
remember Japan's harsh colonial rule. Following the Russo-Japanese
war, Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and controlled it until the end of
World War II.
   During the war, Japan drafted hundreds of thousands of Koreans
as soldiers and forced laborers.
   In Japan on Friday, authorities reported two suspected arson
attacks linked to Roh's visit.
   Three cars were destroyed in one attack by suspected leftist
extremists at a state police headquarters in Omiya, just north of
Tokyo, police said.
   Local authorities reported a separate fire at housing facilities
for South Korean residents in Nagoya, central Japan, on Thursday
evening.
   No one was reported injured in either incident, and only minor
damage was reported to the building.
   Radical extremist groups that oppose Roh's visit claim it is a
step toward reviving the Japanese empire as it existed earlier in
the century.

CZECHOSLOVAK President Vaclav Havel, pictured with Japan's Emperor Akihito,
yesterday asked Japan to help revive the economy in his former communist
country, Reuter reports from Tokyo. In talks with Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, Mr Havel called for increased economic exchanges, including
preferential tariffs, to boost trade. He also appealed for investment to
build up medium and small firms in his country. Mr Miyazawa promised
financing and investment to help privatise Czechoslovak firms. He said Japan
would offer preferential tariffs from next month to boost imports of
Czechoslovak glassware. The two countries are to sign a trade agreement in
Tokyo today.

   Japan's imperial family and top government
officials marked the first anniversary Sunday of Emperor Hirohito's
death with ceremonies at the Imperial Palace and the late monarch's
tomb.
   The anniversary ended an official one-year mourning period for
the royal household, permitting in the coming months the marriage
of a prince and the elaborate coronation of Hirohito's son, Emperor
Akihito.
   Early Sunday, Akihito and Empress Michiko presided over a quiet
ceremony at an Imperial Palace chamber where, by tradition, an
emperor's spirit is enshrined until his tomb is completed.
   About 115 guests, including Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
leaders of Parliament, attended the rite, during which Akihito read
a short prayer for his father's soul. The Empress Dowager Nagako,
86, did not attend because of hip and back problems.
   Another ceremony was to be held later in the afternoon at
Hirohito's tomb. Construction of the dome-shaped mausoleum in
suburban Tokyo was completed Saturday at a reported cost of $18.5
million.
   Hirohito died of cancer Jan. 7 last year at the age of 87. His
62-year reign was the longest in Japanese history, and covered a
difficult period of militarist adventurism, defeat, foreign
occupation and rapid economic reconstruction.
   Under the postwar constitution, the emperor is a symbolic
figurehead who performs mostly ceremonial functions.
   Akihito assumed the throne immediately after his father's death,
but his official coronation will not be held until November. In a
draft budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1, the government
earmarked $58 million for the enthronement and related ceremonies.
   Prince Aya, who at 24 is Akihito's youngest son, will wed
college sweetheart Kiko Kawashima on June 29. Aya is second in line
to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
