   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said that its proposed merger with three affiliates and a large Royex holder would be implemented through an exchange of shares and that the new company will be called Corona Corp. 

   Royex has proposed to merge with affiliates International Corona Resources Ltd., Lacana Mining Corp., Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. and Royex's second-largest holder, Galveston Resources Ltd. 
If approved at planned shareholder meetings in June, the resulting company would be one of North America's largest and lowest-cost gold producers. 

   Under terms of the proposed merger, Royex said Corona Corp.'s share capital would consist mainly of Class A shares, with one vote each, and Class B shares, with 100 votes each. 
Royex Chairman Ned Goodman said certain Royex executives and directors would receive Class B shares with a combined voting stake of more than 50% in Corona Corp. 

   Royex said the merger plan, approved by the directors of each company Tuesday, provides that Royex holders would receive 0.61 Class A share of Corona Corp. for each Royex common share; International Corona holders would receive one Corona Corp. Class A share for each of their common shares; Lacana holders would receive 1.32 Class A shares of the new company for each Lacana share; and Mascot holders would receive 1.11 Class A shares for each Mascot share. 

   Galveston holders would receive 0.43 Class A share for each Galveston Class A share, and 0.43 Class B share in the new company for each Galveston Class B share. 

   The shares of the five companies are expected to resume trading today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
They were halted prior to the opening Wednesday. 

   Royex closed Tuesday at 6.125 Canadian dollars ($4.94), Corona closed at 9.75 dollars, Lacana at 13.125 dollars, Mascot at 11.25 dollars, and Galveston's Class A and B shares each closed at 4.60 dollars. 
The share values give the concerns a combined indicated market capitalization of about 2.52 billion dollars ($2.03 billion). 

   The merger plan also specifies that all intercompany holdings between Royex, its affiliates and Galveston be canceled. 
Royex currently holds a 49% stake in Corona and 45% of Lacana, which in turn owns 50% of Mascot. 
Corona and Galveston are Royex's largest holders, with interests of about 41% and 21%, respectively. 
All companies are based in Toronto but Galveston, based in Vancouver. 

   Royex's Mr. Goodman will be chairman of the new concern, and Peter Steen, Royex president and chief executive officer, would retain his posts. 
Corona Corp. is expected to have 1988 gold output of about 465,000 ounces, annual cash flow of about 200 million dollars, and interests in industrial minerals and oil and gas as well as gold. 
Four new gold mines are expected to be added by the end of 1989 to the five concerns' present eight mines. 

   Royex, International Corona, and Galveston would also issue warrants to purchase new Corona Corp. shares, and Royex said holders of its preferred shares and all warrants, options and convertible securities of the merging companies would be issued securities of Corona Corp. at the proposed merger ratios.

   Royex Gold Mining Corp., three of its affiliates and Royex's second-largest holder proposed a merger that would create one of North America's biggest gold producers. 

   Peter Steen, Royex's president and chief executive officer, said directors of Royex, International Corona Resources Ltd., Lacana Mining Corp., Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. and Galveston Resources Ltd. were to vote yesterday on the proposed merger. 
He said he expected the boards to approve the plan. 

   Mr. Steen wouldn't disclose terms of the proposed merger or the name of the company that would result from it. 
He said further details would be provided today. 

   Royex holds a 49% stake in Corona and a 44% interest in Lacana, which in turn owns 50% of Mascot. 
Corona and Galveston are Royex's largest holders, with interests of about 41% and 14%, respectively. 
All the companies are based in Toronto except Galveston, which is based in Vancouver. 

   Mr. Steen said the merger would simplify Royex's complex corporate structure and result in the formation of a "significant" gold mining concern. 
He said the proposed company would have gold output of 450,000 ounces in 1988 and 650,000 ounces in 1989, at an average cash operating cost of $170 an ounce. 
This would make the company the fifth-largest North American producer and one of the continent's lowest-cost gold mining concerns, according to Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York. 

   Trading in the companies' shares was halted prior to the opening yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

   Royex closed Tuesday at 6.125 Canadian dollars ($4.93), up 12.5 cents. 
Corona closed at 9.75 dollars, down 37.5 cents; Lacana at 13.125 dollars, down 25 cents, and Mascot at 11.25 dollars, unchanged. 
Galveston's Class A shares closed Tuesday at 4.60 dollars, up five cents, and its Class B shares closed unchanged at 4.60 dollars. 

   Based on Tuesday's share values, the concerns have a combined indicated market capitalization of about 2.52 billion dollars ($2.03 billion). 

   Mr. Steen said his gold production estimates for the proposed company include output from the disputed Page-Williams mine, ownership of which is being contested by LAC Minerals Ltd. 
The Supreme Court of Canada is expected to end the lengthy legal battle after it hears an appeal by LAC, scheduled for October. 
An Ontario court previously awarded the mine to Corona.

   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it intends to raise its stake in its affiliate International Corona Resources Ltd. to 51% from 40%. 

   Royex, a Toronto-based gold mining concern, said it also has agreed to sell its 51% stake in Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. to an affiliate for a total of $150 million in cash, notes and preferred shares. 

   Peter Steen, president and chief executive officer of Royex, said it wants to increase its investment in International Corona "to make it abundantly clear that we control the company." 
International Corona is being sued by a director, Murray Pezim, who is seeking to replace five of the company's 10 directors. 
Mr. Steen is also chairman, president and chief executive of International Corona, which has a 49% stake in Royex. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, International Corona closed at $39.50 (Canadian), down $1.50. 
Royex would have to buy about 2.4 million International Corona shares to raise its stake to 51%, and yesterday's closing price gives the additional shares an indicated value of $94.8 million. 

   Mr. Steen said Royex is in discussions with investment advisers to arrange financing for the International Corona stock purchase. 
He said Royex hasn't decided whom it will buy the shares from. 

   Royex is selling the stake in Mascot Gold Mines to Lacana Mining Corp. in order to reduce Royex's bank debt and to help finance the purchase of International Corona shares. 

   Lacana Mining, which is 36% owned by Royex, has agreed to buy the Mascot Gold Mining shares for $65 million cash, a $25 million promissory note and $60 million in preferred shares of a Lacana subsidiary. 
Lacana and Mascot are gold mining concerns based in Toronto. 

   International Corona is a Toronto mining concern.

   Most of the shares will be purchased from Calgary, Alberta-based Westmin Resources Ltd., with the balance from other shareholders, Royex said. 
Westmin said it agreed to sell its block of 3.2 million shares to Royex for $34.7 million. 

   Royex said it will operate Lacana, which has interests in precious metals mining in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., as a separate unit. 
Royex operates gold mines in Canada and the U.S. Westmin is an energy and mining concern. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Lacana closed at $10.50, down 25 cents. 
Westmin closed unchanged at $9.125, and Royex common closed at $4.15, up 5 cents.

   Shareholders of Royex Gold Mining Corp. and four affiliates approved a merger to create Corona Corp., North America's fifth-largest gold producer. 

   Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive officer, said the new company expects gold output of 650,000 ounces next year, up from a previously forecast 465,000 ounces for 1988. 
He said Corona's average cash operating cost is about $170 an ounce, ranking it among the world's lowest-cost gold producers. 

   In addition to Royex, companies involved in the merger are Galveston Resources Ltd., International Corona Resources Ltd., Lacana Mining Corp. and Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. 
All but Vancouver, British Columbia-based Galveston are based in Toronto. 

   The merger was carried out through an exchange of securities of the five concerns, which have a combined indicated market capitalization of about $2 billion. 

   Ned Goodman, chairman of Corona, said its shares would begin trading July 4 on Canadian exchanges. 
The merging companies will continue to trade under their own listings until July 1, he said.

Feisty Pezim Only Wants a Gold Mine
-- And International Corona's Top Job
--
By Leonard Zehr and Alan Bayless
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 03/03/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> T.ICR </IN>
<TEXT>
   Canadian mining promotor Murray Pezim has begun a messy corporate fight to get his gold mine back. 

   Last week, International Corona Resources Ltd. said it would discontinue the positions of vice chairmen, held by the "Pez," as he is called, and Ned Goodman. 
The Toronto gold-mining company said the two could remain as directors. 
In addition, two of Mr. Pezim's nominees to the 10-member board failed to win reelection. 

   Next Monday, the Supreme Court of Ontario will hear Mr. Pezim's request to have five Corona directors removed and replaced with his nominees or with court-appointees. 

   Mr. Pezim, who helped found the company, vowed to press his feud against management, saying the board broke an agreement under which he was to have continued to serve in an "executive position." 

   "Even if we don't win Monday, I'm going to call a special shareholders meeting and vote 51% of the stock for a new board," Mr. Pezim said. 
"My people are buying a lot of (Corona) stock. 
I want to be chairman again." 
Mr. Pezim became vice chairman several years ago when he gave up the post as chairman because of illness. 

   In the early 1980s, Corona was a fledgling mining exploration company that was effectively controlled by Mr. Pezim. 
Under his leadership, the company discovered Canada's richest gold deposit at Hemlo, Ontario. 
Mr. Pezim arranged the initial financing that led to the discovery of the Hemlo ore body. 

   Officials of Corona couldn't be reached for comment on the issue of dropping Mr. Pezim as vice chairman, but in a previous statement, the company said it was "disturbed about statements purportedly made to the media by Mr. Pezim concerning proposed transactions that have not been recommended by Corona's management, nor considered by the Corona board." 

   His fight began six weeks ago when Mr. Pezim asked Peter Steen, Corona's chief executive officer, for 40 Corona annual reports to give to his clients in Europe. 
Mr. Steen refused. 
"Steen told me they don't want me representing the company," Mr. Pezim recalled. 

   A Corona spokeswoman said that Mr. Steen and Theodore Rhenius, Corona's chief financial officer, were in Europe last September speaking to potential investors. 
"Peter felt things might get confused having two groups speaking for the company," she added. 
Mr. Steen couldn't be reached for comment. 

   "I've had indications for the past year that (Corona and its largest single shareholder, Royex Gold Mining Corp.) have wanted to get rid of me," Mr. Pezim said. 
"They totally shafted us at the Corona annual meeting, when they proposed a new board. 
We didn't have the faintest idea that two of my people weren't going to be reappointed." 

   The Corona spokeswoman says Mr. Pezim "started making noises" in January about gaining control of Corona. 
She said Royex, which owns 38% of Corona, supported the new slate of directors "to lessen Mr. Pezim's influence on the board." 
Corona owns about 50% of Royex. 

   One of Canada's most colorful executives, the 66-year-old Mr. Pezim currently promotes a stable of about 40 Vancouver Stock Exchange-listed mining companies. 
Mr. Pezim claims he made and lost a total of more than $150 million (Canadian) from various ventures. 

   He said he lost control of Corona in 1984 after two ill-fated ventures -- Pezzaz greeting cards, which featured audiocassette messages from Hollywood personalities, and Swensen's Ice Cream Co. of Canada. 
"Every time I get involved in something other than gold mining, I get burned," he said. 

   Mr. Goodman, Royex's current chairman, bailed out Corona and Mr. Pezim, who owed his stockbrokers about $4 million in 1984. 
Mr. Pezim estimated his stake to have been about 25%, a portion of which he sold to Mr. Goodman. 

   According to Mr. Pezim, the two had a verbal agreement to retain Mr. Pezim as a senior officer of Corona and a member of the executive committee. 
He also said they agreed that the Goodman and Pezim groups would have equal representation on the Corona board. 

   Now, Mr. Pezim thinks Mr. Goodman is behind the moves to push him out of Corona. 
Mr. Goodman "is my sworn enemy now. 
I'm going to dig up everything I can on him. 
I'm a street fighter. 
I don't quit once I start something." 
Mr. Goodman wasn't available for comment. 

   In addition to owning a 50% interest in one of the three gold mines at Hemlo, Corona won a court decision last year against LAC Minerals Ltd., which also operates a mine at Hemlo. 
The court ordered LAC to hand over its mine, valued by some specialists at more than $1 billion, to Corona. 
An appeals court is expected to rule soon. 

   Mr. Pezim, who launched the suit against LAC, said he wants to have more influence at Corona. 
He also said he disagreed with many of Corona's recent decisions, including a $45 million warrant financing last year. 

   Moreover, he says he wasn't consulted when Royex paid about $52 million earlier this year to acquire effective control of Lacana Mining Corp., a Toronto mining and oil and gas concern. 
While he isn't a director of Royex, he said Royex probably plans to use proceeds to buy more Corona shares to tighten the interlocking ownership among the three companies.

   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it agreed to buy about 1.1 million warrants in a Royex affiliate from Galveston Resources Ltd. for 10 million new Royex common shares and 3 million Canadian dollars ($2.3 million). 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Royex closed at 5.50 dollars, unchanged. 

   Royex said each warrant entitles it to acquire for 7 dollars one common share of International Corona Resources Ltd., in which Royex is currently a holder. 
On the Toronto exchange, Corona closed yesterday at 47.25 dollars, down 1.25 dollars. 

   Royex said the purchase would raise its stake in Corona to 42.4% from 38%, on a fully diluted basis. 
Royex and Corona, both based in Toronto, are gold mining concerns. 

   Royex said the proposed transaction is subject to approval by shareholders of Galveston, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based gold exploration concern.

   Rayrock Yellowknife Resources Inc. said it plans to build a gold mine at its 23.3%-owned Marigold property in Nevada at a cost of at least 30 million Canadian dollars ($24.1 million). 

   The Toronto gold mining and energy concern said it expects the mine to begin production in early 1989. 
It forecasts annual output of 55,000 to 60,000 ounces, and it said reserves are adequate to support production for 10 years. 

   Rayrock's partners include Santa Fe Pacific Mining Inc., which holds a 30% interest, Lacana Mining Corp., with 23.3%, and a unit of Placer Dome Inc., with 23.3%. 
Lacana and Placer Dome are Toronto goldmining concerns. 
Santa Fe Pacific is a unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., Chicago, a railroad and energy concern. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Rayrock closed at 9.625 dollars, unchanged.

   Galveston Resources Ltd., a gold exploration concern, plans a $40 million (Canadian) bond offering and a $20 million equity offering, Murray Pezim, chairman, said. 

   Proceeds will be used for general purposes, "possibly including the purchase of securities of certain gold mining companies," Mr. Pezim said. 

   He declined to say if he would use the funds to purchase stock of International Corona Resources Ltd., a Toronto-based gold mining concern. 
As previously reported, Mr. Pezim is seeking to replace Corona's board. 

   Interest on the bonds will be paid semi-annually in shares of Corona from Galveston's holdings of the stock, Mr. Pezim said. 
Based on a price of $40 a Corona share, the interest payment would be 10%, he said. 
On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Corona closed yesterday at $41, down 75 cents. 

   Mr. Pezim said the payout of Corona shares wouldn't hurt his corporate fight because he expects the battle to be completed within six months. 
He declined to disclose the number of Corona shares held by Galveston, but said it was sufficient to cover the interest payments. 

   The Galveston bonds will have a three-year maturity and will be convertible into Galveston common shares at $40 a share, the company said. 
The offer is subject to regulatory approval. 
Agents are Midland Doherty Ltd. and Maison Placements Canada Inc. 

   The equity issue involves one million shares and one million warrants, to be offered in units of one share and one warrant at $20 each, Galveston said. 
Each warrant allows the holder to purchase an additional share for $22 within two years. 

   Galveston currently has about 7.7 million shares outstanding, of which about 1.6 million are held by Mr. Pezim. 
The shares closed yesterday at $25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, down 12.5 cents. 
Corona, which has about 21.5 million shares outstanding, is 38%-owned by Royex Gold Mining Corp., Toronto.

   TORONTO -- "We've never had any cash," says Corona Corp.'s
Ned Goodman. "When you get into a situation where your
opposition is dealing with cash, you've got to become more
creative."
   Creative financing is the Corona chairman's hallmark.
Mainly by issuing new securities and trading them for assets,
he has built Toronto-based Corona into one of North America's
10 biggest gold mining companies. Through a special class of
shares, he and a few friends have solid control with only
7.6% of the equity. His penchant for complex deals and
ultimate control has given rise to what analysts call the
"Ned Factor," a sort of bewilderment discount that they say
sometimes affects the share prices of his companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite this, Corona shareholders have done better over
the years than those of most other Canadian gold companies.
   Now Mr. Goodman, 52 years old, has proposed a typically
complex series of transactions, entirely paid for with paper,
that could win Corona control of two companies that own
Canada's hottest new gold property. The Eskay Creek property
in British Columbia has estimated reserves of 4.8 million
ounces, worth about US$1.66 billion at current prices.
   But Corona, and Mr. Goodman's paper-shuffling style, are
challenged by a 230 million Canadian dollar (US$196 million),
all-cash offer by Placer Dome Inc. for one of the target
companies, Stikine Resources Ltd. Most analysts agree that
Mr. Goodman's paper probably has more long-term value than
Placer Dome's cash, and Corona also has locked up a huge
block of shares in Stikine. But recent declines in the price
of gold, along with the Ned Factor, have pushed down the
price of Corona's shares and, therefore, the value of its
planned offer. The contest won't be over until Vancouver,
British Columbia-based Placer Dome's bid expires today.
   Mr. Goodman's style has deep roots. Born in Montreal, he
was trained as a geologist and later moved into investment
counseling. He became involved with a sleepy copper producer
called Campbell Chibougamau Mines Ltd. After a 1979 proxy
fight, Mr. Goodman took over as chairman and went on a
shopping binge in the resource sector.
   By 1985, Campbell had run up lots of debt, and Mr. Goodman
was outnumbered when the board decided to sell the company's
interest in Royex Gold Mining Corp. He quit the Campbell
board and bought the Royex stake in a transaction that even
Mr. Goodman says was complex.
   "I said that I'd never put myself in a position again of
working for a company where someone else is going to make the
decisions," Mr. Goodman says.
   Royex's main asset was its holding in International Corona
Resources Ltd., which in turn held a controlling stake in
Royex. Over the next three years, Royex acquired major
interests in other resource outfits, financing the deals in
part by transferring investments between units.
   "We were getting an awful lot of criticism because we had
a complicated company. I didn't like it either. (But) we had
no choice," Mr. Goodman says. To simplify matters, he merged
Royex with four related companies to form Corona in 1988.
   In his latest proposal, Mr. Goodman plans to spin off
Corona's gold assets into a separately listed company. Some
shares of the new company, to be called Corona Gold Corp.,
will be distributed to current Corona holders. He also has
offered a combination of Corona and Corona Gold shares to the
owners of Eskay Creek, Stikine and Prime Resources Group
Inc., which would then be merged with Corona Gold.
   Mr. Goodman says the Corona restructuring, which would
leave the parent holding a mixed basket of resource
interests, is meant to still the "moans and groans" of
holders who disapproved of the company's branching out from
precious metals.
   But the restructuring plan hasn't satisfied all of Mr.
Goodman's critics, who complain that he freely spends
Corona's Class A shares, which carry one vote apiece, while
leaving intact the number of Class B shares, which have 100
votes apiece and are largely held by Mr. Goodman and four
other directors.
   A study of Corona's past share price performance indicates
that backing Mr. Goodman has been wise. Barry Allan, an
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.,
calculates that an investor buying a Royex share in January
1987, when Mr. Goodman became Royex's chairman, would have
seen a 3.4% appreciation in his money. This compares with a
9.9% drop in the Toronto Stock Exchange gold index over the
same period and a decline of 15% in the price of gold
bullion.
   Nevertheless, "there are a lot of people who don't want to
have anything to do with the guy (Mr. Goodman). I sometimes
wonder whether people are afraid of him because he's two
steps ahead of them," says John Embry, a vice president of
Toronto-based Royal Bank Investment Management, which holds
about 4% of the Corona Class A shares.
   Although he backs Mr. Goodman's proposals to acquire Eskay
Creek and restructure Corona, Mr. Embry says he remains
concerned Corona will continue to control the new gold unit
with a 50.2% holding.
   Mr. Goodman plans to remain at the helm of the Corona
parent, which will concentrate on building up its interests
in base metals, oil and gas, industrial minerals and
financial services. Meantime, Corona Gold, if it succeeds in
its plan to merge with the current owners of Eskay Creek,
will focus on developing that ore body. Mr. Goodman estimates
the addition of Eskay Creek would boost Corona's production
to about 1.2 million ounces of gold in 1994 from 700,000
ounces expected this year.

   A gold mine developed by LAC Minerals Ltd. that is expected to become Canada's biggest producer belongs to International Corona Resources Ltd., an Ontario Court of Appeal ruled. 

   In a long-awaited decision, a panel of four judges unanimously upheld a 1986 ruling by the Supreme Court of Ontario and dismissed LAC's appeal to overturn it. 
LAC declined to say whether it would seek a further appeal. 

   Peter Steen, International Corona's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said "Naturally, we're delighted. 
We feel that justice has been done." 
As a result of the added production from the disputed mine, International Corona expects to more than double its gold output this year and Royex Gold Mining Corp., which holds a 49% interest in International Corona, expects its gold output to increase about 40%. 

   Mr. Steen said he will soon meet with Vancouver-based Teck Corp. to discuss their plans to jointly operate the mine and one next to it at Ontario's Hemlo gold district. 
Together, the two mines are expected to produce about 700,000 ounces of gold annually by 1990. 

   David Thompson, Teck's vice president, finance, said Teck is "very pleased." 
Teck acquired half of Page-Williams in 1986 and its share of the mine output is expected to double Teck's gold production this year. 

   LAC must hand over the mine once International Corona pays it 154 million Canadian dollars ($117.8 million) to help cover the mine's development costs, unless LAC can obtain a court order deferring the transfer. 
An International Corona lawyer said he expected International Corona to pay LAC the funds this week. 

   In return, LAC must pay International Corona an amount equal to the mine's earnings since it opened in January 1986. 
The mine, which was expected to provide about 40% of LAC's gold production in 1987, earned about 24.3 million dollars during the 18 months ended June 30. 

   In their 126-page ruling, delayed because of the death in June of one of their members, the appeal court judges said they found "ample evidence" to support the conclusions of Ontario Supreme Court Justice R.E. Holland, who heard the original court trial. 

   The appeal court upheld the conclusions of Justice Holland. 
It cited LAC for breaching a trust with International Corona when the two talked about a joint venture in 1981. 
The panel agreed LAC used confidential information given to it by International Corona, then a tiny exploration company, to acquire the property where the PageWilliams mine now operates. 

   Analysts say they expect the ruling to have a positive effect on International Corona, Royex and Teck share prices. 

   Paul Esquivel, an analyst with Davidson Partners Ltd., Toronto, said he believes Corona's shares are valued at about 60 dollars if one includes the Page-Williams mine. 

   In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, International Corona closed at 47.50 dollars, up 25 cents. 
Royex shares closed at 5.50 dollars, up 12.5 cents; Teck closed at 33.75 dollars, down 25 cents. 

   Amy Gassman, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York, said she expects a "moderately negative" short-term impact on LAC's share price. 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, LAC closed at 18 dollars, up 12.5 cents.

   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it is offering a package of securities and cash with an indicated value of about $234.4 million (Canadian) under its previously reported plan to raise its stake in International Corona Resources Ltd., a gold mining affiliate based here. 

   Under the offer, mailed yesterday to shareholders of International Corona, Royex said it is offering to purchase four million International Corona common shares for $4 each in cash and $47.50 of new Royex preference shares and warrants. 
Royex currently holds about 8.2 million, or 38% of International Corona's 21.6 million issued common shares. 

   Royex said it is also offering one Royex preference share and one Royex warrant, with a combined indicated value of $42.50, for each of 711,053 International Corona warrants that expire Aug. 31. 

   Royex said the offer, if successful, would effectively raise its interest in International Corona to 58% from 38% on an undiluted basis, or to 44% from 24% on a fully diluted basis. 
Royex said its voting interest in International Corona would be raised to 50%. 

   Under the offer, which is scheduled to expire April 22, Royex said its two new series of Royex preference shares will initially be convertible into 3.33 Royex common shares, subject to a one-time adjustment to reflect the outcome of litigation between International Corona and Lac Minerals Ltd. 
The adjustment will be made after the litigation is resolved, or not later than April 30, 1990, Royex said. 

   The litigation relates to a dispute between International Corona and Lac over a large northern Ontario gold mine. 

   Royex said its offer for International Corona common shares isn't conditional on any minimum acceptance level, but if fewer than 2.7 million International Corona common are deposited, International Corona's share and warrant holders will be entitled to withdraw from the offer within two days after its expiration. 
If more than four million International Corona shares are tendered, Royex said it will pay for the shares on a pro-rata basis. 

   Trading in International Corona and Royex shares was halted yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
In trading Monday, Corona closed at $43.125, up 62.5 cents, and Royex common closed at $6.125, down 25 cents.

   International Corona Resources Ltd. said its board decided to make no recommendation to holders concerning Royex Gold Mining Corp.'s offer for Corona shares and warrants because a pending court ruling could affect Corona's share price. 

   Corona said its financial adviser, Dean Witter Reynolds (Canada) Inc., determined that the Royex offer had a market value of $52.625 per Corona share, and $40.875 per Corona warrant, based on market prices before the March 31 offer was made. 
But it said Dean Witter also determined that a ruling in Corona's dispute with LAC Minerals Ltd. over ownership of a gold mine could drive the price of Corona's common to as low as $25 or as high as $92. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Corona, a mining and exploration company, closed at $54.50, up $2.50; Royex closed at $7.75, up 50 cents. 

   Royex -- which is Corona's largest shareholder, controlling about 40% -- made the offer to strengthen its hand against Murray Pezim, a dissident Corona director who has filed suit seeking to replace five of Corona's 10 directors. 

   In a dissenting opinion, Mr. Pezim rejected the Royex offer. 

   Both Royex and Corona are based in Toronto.

   The Supreme Court of Canada agreed to let LAC Minerals Ltd. appeal a decision that would have forced it to hand over a big Ontario gold mine to International Corona Resources Ltd. 

   The court didn't offer its reasons for the decision. 
A LAC spokesman said the appeal might not be heard until 1989. 

   Corona's president and chief executive officer, Peter Steen, said he was "disappointed" by the ruling. 
It followed a decision in October by an Ontario Court of Appeal to award the Page-Williams mine, in Ontario's Hemlo district, to Corona, upholding a 1986 court ruling. 
The appeals court agreed that LAC used confidential information given to it by Corona to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine now operates. 

   Corona said it plans a cross-appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the company's claim that it shouldn't have to pay LAC 154 million Canadian dollars ($117.8 million) to help compensate it for developing the Page-Williams property. 

   The outcome of the legal battle will significantly affect both Toronto-based companies and their affiliates. 
Page-Williams is expected to become Canada's biggest gold mine. 
It would have accounted for more than half of Corona's gold output and about 40% of LAC's gold output this year. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, LAC closed at 14 Canadian dollars ($10.71), up 87.5 cents, and Corona closed at 49.875 dollars, down 12.5 dollars. 
Royex Gold Mining Corp., which holds a 49% stake in Corona, closed at 6.50 dollars, down 1.375 dollars. 

   Vancouver-based Teck Corp. had agreed with Corona to jointly operate the Page-Williams mine and one next to it. 
Teck's Class B shares closed at 35.25 dollars, down 5.75 dollars.

   Corona Corp. said it agreed to sell its oil and gas assets to a unit of Calgary, Alberta-based Poco Petroleums Ltd. for Poco stock with an indicated market value of 72.6 million Canadian dollars (US$59.9 million). 

   The planned sale to Poco's 89%-owned Central Explorers Inc. unit would result in Corona becoming Poco's largest holder, with a 25.4% fully diluted stake. 

   Poco is a fast-growing oil and gas producer. 
Toronto-based Corona, formed last week through the merger of five affiliated mining concerns, is among North America's top five gold producers. 

   Under the proposed transaction's terms, the companies said Central will acquire Corona's Lacana Petroleum unit's oil and gas assets, which are mainly in Canada. 
They include about 6.4 million barrels of oil reserves, 56.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, 78,000 acres of undeveloped land and related working capital of more than C$20 million. 

   Central will incur a debt to Poco for the assets and Poco will issue to Corona five million new common shares and two million new preferred shares that would be convertible to an equal number of Poco common shares. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Poco's common shares closed at $10.375, up 37.5 cents. 
The company currently has about 20.5 million common shares outstanding. 

   Corona, which will have three nominees on Poco's board, said it currently doesn't plan to raise its stake in Poco. 
A Corona official said the Poco investment would assign a market value to Corona's oil and gas assets, which the company believed weren't recognized previously by investors. 

   The transaction is expected to close this summer, subject to regulatory approvals.

   A Royex Gold Mining Corp. management group intends to strengthen its long-term control of Corona Corp., a proposed new gold mining company, by restricting the sale of members' multiple-voting shares in the new concern. 

   Peter Steen, president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Royex, said management group members would be required under a planned agreement to offer to one another any Corona Class B multiple-voting shares they intend to sell. 
If the shares aren't sold, they would be converted to Royex Class A shares and sold on the open market, he said. 

   Shareholders of Royex and four other mining companies are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a proposed merger that would result in the creation of Corona. 
If approved, the company would rank among North America's biggest gold producers.

   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it plans to begin gold production at its 30%-owned Jolu property in Saskatchewan before year end. 

   Royex projected annual gold output at Jolu of about 50,000 ounces, beginning in 1989. 
The property is 70%-owned by Vancouver-based Mahogany Minerals Resources Inc., a gold exploration concern. 

   Royex said it expects to spend about 20 million Canadian dollars ($16.2 million) to complete construction of a mine and mill at the site. 
Financing will be arranged through a gold loan, the company said. 

   Royex said the mine would be operated by Corona Corp., pending the result of Royex's merger with four other Canadian gold mining concerns. 
Corona is the name of the company that would result from the planned merger, which Royex said it expects to complete early in July.

   Peter Steen, president and chief executive officer of Corona Corp., said the company remains "receptive to examining an out-of-court settlement" with LAC Minerals Ltd. regarding the disputed Williams mine at Hemlo, Ontario. 

   Still, the sides haven't discussed the issue since a meeting earlier this year, he said. 

   "That's the only meeting that I have had, and that's the only meeting that Corona has had" with LAC, Mr. Steen said in an interview. 
Asked if Corona is willing to reopen talks, he said: "I think we're waiting for {LAC's president and chief executive, Peter Allen} to make his move." 

   A LAC spokesman said "nothing substantial was discussed" at the spring meeting, and that LAC doesn't plan to resume talks. 

   International Corona Resources Ltd., one of five affiliated companies that agreed earlier this month to merge to form Corona Corp., was awarded ownership of the Williams mine in 1986 by the Supreme Court of Ontario. 
The decision was upheld on appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada will hear a final appeal Oct. 11. 

   Mr. Steen said Corona, whose merger takes effect Friday, doesn't believe its case will be affected by other litigation in progress involving the Hemlo claims. 

   Neither Mr. Steen nor Corona Vice President and Treasurer Tony Walsh would offer specific earnings or revenue projections. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Walsh described as "reasonable" an analyst's forecast that Corona will earn about 77 million Canadian dollars (US$63.8 million), or 53 cents a share, on revenue of C$264 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, and C$111 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenue of C$376 million for fiscal 1989. 

   The forecast is based on gold output of 466,000 ounces this year and 630,000 ounces for fiscal 1989 and an average gold price of $450 an ounce. 
Corona previously forecast output of 465,000 ounces for 1988 and 650,000 ounces for 1989 at an average cash production cost of $170 an ounce. 

   Igor Levental, Corona's newly appointed director, acquisitions and evaluations, said Corona "could take on a C$400-$500 million company" with its current financial resources. 
Mr. Steen said the company is considering an offer for Toronto-based Franco-Nevada Mining Corp., in which Corona holds a 15% stake. 
"It's on the market, and we are taking a look at it," he said.

   The Supreme Court of Canada awarded the country's richest gold mine to Corona Corp., ending an acrimonious eight-year legal battle between Corona and the mine's developer, LAC Minerals Ltd. 

   The court ruled that Toronto-based LAC must hand over the Page-Williams mine in northern Ontario and that Corona must pay LAC 154 million Canadian dollars (US$131.6 million) for past development costs. 
With interest, the payment would amount to more than C$210 million. 

   Corona, also based in Toronto, said the payment is to come equally from it and from Teck Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia, which plans to operate the mine in an equal partnership with Corona. 
The two companies also will split about C$80 million in profit from the mine that has been held in a trust account since 1986. 

   The ruling upholds the findings of the Ontario Supreme Court in 1986 and the Ontario Court of Appeals a year later, saying that LAC had "breached a duty of confidence" with Corona's predecessor company when it talked with LAC about a possible joint venture in 1981. 
The high court said LAC used confidential information given to it by Corona's predecessor to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine operates. 

   The Page-Williams mine, which last year produced 379,000 ounces of gold, should produce 490,000 ounces this year, said Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive officer. 
He said Corona's half-share of the output would boost the company's production this year by 64% to an expected 625,000 ounces, advancing the company's transformation from a small exploration outfit in the early 1980s to one of Canada's top gold producers. 

   Mr. Steen said the companies plan to accelerate the exploration of little-known areas of the mine. 
The reserves already discovered contain nearly seven million ounces of gold, he said. 
Teck said its operations, without Page-Williams, are expected to produce about 150,000 ounces of gold this year. 

   LAC's chief financial officer, Rolly Francisco, said he was disappointed with the court's ruling but said LAC will abide by the decision and work closely with Corona and Teck to ensure an orderly handover of the mine. 
LAC hasn't included earnings from the Page-Williams mine in its own accounts since 1986. 

   LAC's defeat in court could leave the company vulnerable to a takeover attempt, analysts said. 

   With the company currently holding cash of about C$250 million plus the payment due for the Page-Williams mine, "I think it becomes a real attractive takeover candidate if the share price dropped. 
You would be able to finance much of the takeover cost with the company's own cash," said Julian Baldry, a senior mining analyst at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. 

   Before the court decision was announced, LAC shares closed Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $11.375 each, down 12.5 cents. 
Mr. Baldry estimated the company could become vulnerable to takeover if its stock falls below C$10 ($8.54) a share. 

   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Corona Class A shares closed at $7.375 each, down 50 cents. 
Teck Class B shares closed at C$22.625, down C$1.375, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

   Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd. said it offered to buy 19.99% of Dome Mines Ltd. for 417.1 million Canadian dollars ($313.1 million). 

   The transaction could thwart Dome Mines' plan to form North America's biggest gold mining company through a merger with two other concerns. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it offered 21.50 dollars a share to Dome Petroleum Ltd. for about 19.4 million of the 20.9 million Dome Mines shares that the oil and gas company owns. 
If the sale goes through, Giant Yellowknife said it would vote the shares against a proposal to combine Dome Mines with Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. and Placer Development Ltd. 

   Shareholders of the three companies are to vote on the merger proposal Aug. 12. 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dome Mines closed at 21 dollars, up one dollar. 

   David Emery, president of Giant Yellowknife, declined to say why his company would oppose the merger. 
But a Giant Yellowknife insider said the company prefers a major stake in Dome Mines to a smaller one in the combined company, since the two concerns could benefit from "synergies" in their gold mining operations. 
The companies operate several gold mines and mills near Timmins, Ontario. 

   The insider said Giant Yellowknife is also interested in Dome Mines' 21.4% stake in Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd., which has zinc, copper and gold mines in the area. 
Giant Yellowknife is a gold producer, but it is indirectly controlled by Ariadne Australia Ltd., of Australia, which has interests in other metals. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it would offer to buy Dome Petroleum's remaining 1.5 million shares in Dome Mines if certain regulatory approvals can be obtained or waived. 
Under Ontario securities regulations, such approval is usually required if a buyer wishes to purchase 20% or more of a company without extending the offer to all shareholders. 
Dome Petroleum's shares represent about 21.5% of Dome Mines. 

   Calgary, Alberta-based Dome Petroleum said it expects to respond to the offer by Friday, which is when it expires. 
The sale would need approval from creditors whose loans to Dome Petroleum are secured by its Dome Mines shares. 
The creditors would receive about 75% of the proceeds if the offer were accepted, Dome Petroleum said. 

   Dome Mines, Toronto-based Campbell and Vancouver-based Placer said they still intend to proceed with the proposed merger. 

   Analysts were generally negative toward Giant Yellowknife's offer. 
John Lydall, of First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto, said the price offered to Dome Petroleum for its Dome Mines shares is no higher than the price Dome Petroleum would receive in the form of stock from the merger of the three companies. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it plans no follow-up offer to Dome Mines' remaining holders. 
It said that if its offer is accepted by Dome Petroleum and the gold company merger is approved, it will consider exercising certain rights under Canadian law that could force Dome Mines to buy back Giant Yellowknife's holdings in the company. 
The merger plan requires approval by two-thirds of Dome Mines' holders. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it would finance purchase of the Dome Mines stake by borrowing from Giant Resources Ltd., a unit of Ariadne Australia. 
It said it planned to retire the debt through a rights issue to its shareholders. 
It also said it has arranged, subject to regulatory approval, for a private placement of 1.4 million Giant Yellowknife shares with Giant Resources at 28.25 dollars each. 

   Giant Yellowknife currently has 6.9 million shares outstanding. 
Its shares closed at 27.25 dollars, down 75 cents, in trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

   Giant Yellowknife, which expects to produce about 200,000 ounces of gold from five mines this year, was indirectly acquired by Ariadne earlier this year. 
Ariadne, through Giant Resources, since has acquired a zinc and lead mine in Canada's Yukon. 

   Dome Mines, Campbell and Placer had 1986 combined gold production of 825,000 ounces, more than any single producer outside South Africa and the Soviet Union. 
Analysts estimate output of the amalgamated company would rise to 1.1 million ounces by 1989. 
Placer also has copper, silver and oil and gas interests.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. radically altered its plans to
secure control of Canada's hottest gold prospect and said it
would pursue talks with rival Placer Dome Inc. Analysts and
some Corona officials expect the talks will result in joint
ownership of the rich ore deposit.
   Corona said it was pressured to change its plans after
Murray Pezim, a Corona director and honorary chairman,
refused to deliver to Corona his shares in Prime Resources
Group Inc. under a previous agreement. Mr. Pezim also is
chairman of Prime Resources, which owns, together with
Stikine Resources Ltd., the Eskay Creek gold property in
northwestern British Columbia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eskay Creek has estimated reserves of about 4.8 million
ounces of gold, worth about $1.73 billion at current market
prices.
   Under its revised proposal, Toronto-based Corona said it
dropped plans to spin off its gold assets into a separately
listed subsidiary and to acquire Prime Resources by swapping
shares in the subsidiary.
   Corona also said it improved the terms of an offer to
Stikine's major shareholders, who had committed to Corona
their 42% stake. For each Stikine share, holders will receive
one new Corona preferred share that will be redeemable at a
later date into either 8.5 Corona Class A subordinate voting
shares or 70 Canadian dollars (US$60.14) in cash. Corona said
it plans to offer, subject to regulatory approval, the same
terms to other Stikine holders to increase its stake to 55%.
   Placer Dome, a Vancouver, British Columbia, gold mining
concern, has offered C$67.50 a share for Stikine, valuing the
company at about C$225 million. The bid by Placer, which
already owns 45% of Stikine's shares, expired yesterday, but
the company said it wouldn't have final bid results until
today.
   Corona said it agreed to acquire a 7% stake in Prime
Resources from Vancouver financier Jim Pattison. The purchase
price is one Corona Class A share and an amount in cash to
bring the value of the transaction to C$9 a share. Corona
said it also obtained voting rights over the rest of Mr.
Pattison's holdings in Prime Resources, bringing Corona's
voting control in Prime to 34% from 20% currently.
   As previously reported, Mr. Pezim, the Corona director,
refused to turn over his shares to Corona's offer unless the
terms were improved. Mr. Pezim said Corona's latest offer "is
what we wanted in the first place."
   But Corona spokesman Brian Hay said the company hadn't
made any new offers for Mr. Pezim's holdings. He said Corona
decided not to take Mr. Pezim to court over the previous
agreement to deliver his Prime Resources shares because of
the cost of such a procedure.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Corona Class A shares
closed unchanged yesterday at C$7.625 after rising 25
Canadian cents on Tuesday following the Corona announcement.
Stikine shares closed yesterday at C$70, down C$2, after
closing unchanged a day earlier. Placer Dome shares rose 50
Canadian cents Tuesday and 12.5 Canadian cents yesterday to
finish at C$18.50. On the Vancouver Stock Exchange, Prime
Resources shares closed yesterday at C$8.50, up 37.5 Canadian
cents, after losing 87.5 Canadian cents on Tuesday.
   Mr. Hay said he expects talks between Corona and Placer
Dome to result in a merger of Stikine and Prime Resources
into an operating company to develop the Eskay creek ore
deposit. Production at Eskay Creek isn't expected to begin
before 1993.
   "I see a joint venture between Placer and Corona on this
thing," Mr. Pezim said.
   Hugh Leggatt, a Placer Dome spokesman, said, "We'd like to
reach an agreement with them {Corona} on the disposition of
the Eskay Creek assets. In principle we're quite prepared to
speak with them."

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- International Corona Corp.
announced a plan that would split Corona into two companies
and loosen mining financier Ned Goodman's control over its
gold assets.
   Under terms of the plan, Corona would keep the gold
assets, but its two classes of stock would be replaced with a
single class of shares with equal voting rights. Holders also
would get shares in Dundee Bancorp Inc., a Corona subsidiary
based in Toronto. Corona would spin off Dundee, and transfer
to the subsidiary its interests in oil and gas, industrial
minerals and merchant banking.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corona put a value of 281.4 million Canadian dollars
(US$244.8 million) on its non-gold assets.
   Analysts said the restructuring likely would bolster the
market valuation of Corona's gold assets, making it easier
for the company to raise equity financing to develop its next
big gold project, the Eskay Creek deposit in northern British
Columbia. They said the improved investor opinion would
reflect in part the company's plans to abandon its
much-criticized multiple-share structure, which gives Mr.
Goodman and a few associates control of 70% of the votes in
Corona with less than 4% of the equity.
   Shares in Dundee Bancorp, however, likely would suffer, as
the subsidiary would maintain a two-tiered share structure
that keeps Mr. Goodman and others firmly in control of voting
rights, analysts said. Mr. Goodman would serve as chairman
and chief executive officer of Dundee Bancorp, whose assets
would include a one-third stake in Poco Petroleums Ltd., a
Canadian oil and gas concern. Dundee also would be the
biggest shareholder in Corona, with a 30% stake.
   In late trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday,
Corona Class A shares were quoted at $7.50, down 50 cents a
share. The Class B multiple voting shares finished on the
Toronto Stock Exchange at C$9.375, down 87.5 Canadian cents.
   The restructuring will allow investors to choose between
Corona's gold assets and Mr. Goodman's enterprising style,
said Barry Allan, an analyst at Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Ltd. "You can either play gold or you can play Ned, who has
demonstrated that he can put deals together," he said.
   Mr. Goodman, with little cash but a knack for creative
financing, helped build Corona from a hodgepodge of small
mining outfits into a major concern that produces about 700
ounces of gold annually.
   Under terms of the plan, which is subject to regulatory
and shareholder approvals, shareholders would exchange 100
Corona shares of either class for 70 new Corona shares and 30
shares and 25 warrants of Dundee Bancorp. Dundee would pay
Corona C$100 million in cash, which the company said it would
use to pay off debt. The transaction is expected to be
completed in October, Corona said.
   Separately, Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief
executive officer, said the company had resumed talks with
Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver about jointly developing the
Eskay Creek deposit, which contains an estimated 3.2 million
ounces of gold. The two concerns have been at loggerheads
since last year when they launched competing bids to acquire
the companies that own the property.
   "I think we're getting to the point where we feel we'll
have a suitable arrangement" with Placer Dome, Mr. Steen
said.
   Although Corona has the dominant ownership position at
Eskay Creek, it has large debts and little cash. Placer
Dome's deep pockets could be invaluable in financing the
development of the mine, which analysts estimate will cost
some C$200 million.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. director Murray Pezim said the
company will announce today an improved offer for Stikine
Resources Ltd., upping the ante in a battle for control of a
Canadian gold property.
   Mr. Pezim also said Corona, based here, will announce
plans to spin off its gold assets into a separately listed
company that would offer to acquire all the shares of Prime
Resources Group Inc. Prime Resources is Stikine's partner and
the operator of the promising Eskay Creek gold project in
northwestern British Columbia. Corona already owns 20% of the
stock in Prime Resources, of which Mr. Pezim is chairman.
Prime Resources and Stikine are both based in Vancouver.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Pezim's disclosure unravels efforts by Corona's
management to keep the news under wraps until this morning.
Trading in shares of Corona, Stikine and Prime has been
halted since last week.
   Mr. Pezim, who is also honorary chairman of Corona, has
been in hot water before with the company's management. In a
fiery 1987 boardroom battle, Mr. Pezim, commonly known as
"the Pez," was ousted from an executive position amid
management charges that he had talked to the media about
proposed Corona transactions that hadn't been considered by
the Corona board.
   A Corona spokesman wouldn't comment on the accuracy of the
latest disclosures, but said Corona Chairman Ned Goodman was
"very concerned" about Mr. Pezim's statements. "Murray talked
when he shouldn't have," the spokesman said.
   According to Mr. Pezim, Corona will offer 6.5 Corona Class
A shares and two Prime Resources shares for each share of
Stikine.
   The revised Corona offer would have an indicated value of
about 257.3 million Canadian dollars (US$219.6 million), or
C$75.69 a Stikine share, based on market prices before the
trading halt went into effect. This is higher than a rival
bid by Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver, which has offered
C$229.5 million, or C$67.50 for each Stikine share. Placer is
offering cash with a share alternative.
   Despite a possibly higher offer from Corona, analysts
weren't convinced that the Placer bid would be the less
favorable of the two. The gap between the bids "is quickly
closed when one considers one {offer} is cash and the other
isn't," said Egizio Bianchini, an analyst at Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon Inc.
   Corona's previous offer involved a complex plan under
which it would acquire a 44.6% stake in a company that was to
be formed from the merger of Stikine and Prime Resources. In
exchange, Corona was to issue to Stikine holders a package of
securities that analysts valued at anywhere from C$65 to C$70
a Stikine share.
   Mr. Pezim said that under Corona's plan to spin off its
gold assets, shareholders will receive one share in the new
gold company for every 2.27 Corona shares currently held.
   Corona is one of North America's biggest gold-mining
concerns, with production last year of about 680,000 ounces
of gold. The company also has interests in industrial
minerals and oil and gas.
   "At the end, Corona will control 45%" of the new gold
company, Mr. Pezim said. He said the gold subsidiary will be
based in Vancouver, with Peter Steen, Corona's president and
chief executive, serving as chairman of the new company. John
Ivany, president and chief executive of Prime Resources, will
serve in the same roles at the new company, Mr. Pezim said.
   Mr. Pezim said the new gold company will then bid to
acquire Prime Resources, offering one share of the new gold
company for each Prime Resources share.

   Corona Corp., Toronto, said it will acquire a 44.6% stake
in a new company to be formed through the proposed merger of
two mining companies, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime
Resources Group Inc., both based in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   Corona said it will acquire the stake in exchange for 16.6
million new Class A shares, giving the transaction an
indicated value of about 128.7 million Canadian dollars
(US$110.7 million).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corona said the proposed transaction "represents a
potential 20% increase in gold and equivalent reserves, and
approximately a 10% dilution in outstanding common equity."
Corona has about 141.9 million Class A shares outstanding. On
the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, the Class A shares closed
at C$7.75, down 50 Canadian cents, in heavy trading.
   Stikine and Prime each hold 50% stakes in the Eskay Creek
property in Northern British Columbia. The property has
created much speculation in the mining industry as a possible
major new precious-metal and base-metal find.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. said it was
again seeking a buyer for its 92% stake in Asamera Minerals
Inc., a precious-metal concern, as part of an effort to
reduce debt.
   Gulf Canada, controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family,
pulled the Asamera stake off the market last spring because
of low gold prices. The gold price has barely changed since
then, but a Gulf spokesman said the company recently has been
contacted by parties wondering if the stake still was for
sale. He said there aren't any formal discussions currently
taking place.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman said that Asamera doesn't fit with Gulf
Canada's strategy of concentrating on its principal business
of oil and gas production and development. He said Gulf
Canada wants to reduce its long-term debt to about 500
million Canadian dollars ($431.2 million) by the end of this
year from C$902 million at Dec. 31, 1990.
   Asamera's main asset is a 51% stake in the Cannon gold and
silver mine at Wenatchee, Wash., which last year produced
149,330 ounces of gold. Analysts estimate Gulf Canada's
holding in Asamera could fetch between C$50 million and C$75
million.
   Vancouver, British Columbia-based Corona Corp., a big gold
producer that indirectly holds an interest in the Cannon mine
through an affiliate, Breakwater Resources Ltd., said it
would "take another look" at the Asamera stake. Corona last
year ended a pact to purchase the stake for about C$100
million in stock.
   Vancouver-based Breakwater, in which Corona holds a 27%
interest, owns 49% of the Cannon mine.
   Separately, Asamera reported a loss for 1990 of C$5.2
million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, after writing down
C$6.9 million in deferred exploration costs. A year earlier,
Asamera had net income of C$2 million, or eight Canadian
cents a share. Revenue rose to C$37.6 million from C$37
million.

   Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. said Newmont Mining Corp. is seeking a buyer for its 33.5% stake in Sherritt Gordon. 

   The approximately 7.5 million Sherritt Gordon shares held by Newmont have a current market value of about 39.2 million Canadian dollars ($30.7 million). 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Sherritt Gordon shares closed at 5.25 dollars ($4.11), down 25 cents. 

   Sherritt Gordon said the possible sale of the stake is one of several steps Newmont is taking to reduce debt. 
Officials at Newmont, a New York-based mining concern, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Newmont is Sherritt Gordon's biggest holder. 

   Separately, Sherritt Gordon said it agreed to sell its 58% interest in SherrGold Inc. to Hayes Resources Inc. for about 23.2 million Canadian dollars ($18.2 million) in cash and stock. 

   SherrGold's chief asset is the MacLellan gold mine in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, which produced about 40,000 ounces of gold last year. 

   Under the agreement, Hayes will pay Sherritt Gordon 17 million dollars in cash and 2.4 million new Hayes shares. 
The shares would represent an 8% interest in Hayes, a small Toronto-based exploration concern controlled by a group that includes American Barrick Resources Corp., a major gold producer also based in Toronto. 

   Sherritt Gordon, a mining, metal refining, fabricating and fertilizer concern, said the proposed sale of the SherrGold interest would improve its balance sheet and reduce consolidated debt about 14 million dollars. 

   In trading Friday on the Toronto exchange, SherrGold shares closed at 1.75 dollars, down 14 cents, and Hayes shares closed at 2.20 dollars, unchanged.

<HL> Newmont Mining, Banks Are Negotiating Million-Ounce Gold Loan, Sources Say </HL>

<SO> </SO>
<CO> NEM NGC </CO>
<IN> PCS CMD </IN>
<TEXT>
   Newmont Mining Corp. is negotiating with a syndicate of international banks to arrange a million-ounce gold loan, more than twice the size of any existing gold-based loan, bank and investment executives said. 

   In trading late Friday on the London Metal Exchange the spot price of gold was quoted at $477 an ounce, giving Newmont's planned loan an indicated value of $477 million. 
If Newmont obtains the gold loan, banking and gold mining executives say its unprecedented size will enhance the popularity and credibility of this low-cost financing technique that is helping to fuel a boom in North American and Australian gold production. 

   Peter Munk, chairman and chief executive officer of Toronto-based American Barrick Resources Corp., said a million-ounce gold loan "could be a turning point" for the gold mining industry. 
Banks have been cautious about lending large amounts of gold and haven't lent more than 400,000 ounces to any one borrower. 
American Barrick borrowed 264,000 ounces of gold last fall. 

   "It would certainly add a lot of credence to the market," said Anthony Walsh, treasurer and vice president of Toronto-based Royex Gold Mining Corp. 

   T. Peter Philip, senior vice president of New York-based Newmont Mining, declined to comment. 
Banking and investment executives said Bank of Nova Scotia is leading the syndicate and Newmont plans to create a new holding company to borrow the gold. 

   Newmont is expected to use the loan to refinance some of the $2 billion it borrowed last September when it paid a special dividend of $33 a share to thwart a takeover bid from a group led by T. Boone Pickens Jr. Bank executives said the gold loan probably will have a five-year term with an annual interest rate of about 1.5%. 
Newmont would repay the loan with gold produced by its 90%-owned Newmont Gold Co., North America's largest gold producer. 
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Newmont Mining closed at $34.875, down 25 cents. 

   Gold loans have tended to have terms of less than three years and are used primarily to fund working capital. 
Newmont's planned five-year loan apparently signals banks' willingness to lend gold for long-term uses. 

   Gold loans are gaining popularity because of their low cost and diminishing investor appetite for new gold shares in the wake of the stock market crash. 
"If the stock market isn't available, gold loans are the best alternative," said Ray Jenner, treasurer of Edmonton, Alberta-based Echo Bay Mines Ltd. 

   "There's going to be a lot of new gold mines coming into production and more of the financing will come from gold loans," said Gordon Hawke, a senior manager with Royal Bank of Canada. 

   Typically, when a mining company borrows gold from a bank it agrees to repay the gold in installments to the bank with gold produced at its mines. 
Borrowers can receive cash for a gold loan by selling the borrowed gold. 

   Banks have lent small amounts of gold for decades to borrowers such as jewelers, who use gold in their business. 
But it was only in 1985 that gold mining companies began to borrow significant amounts of gold to help finance their operations. 
Echo Bay Mines says it was the first in North America to use the technique in March 1985 when it borrowed 100,000 ounces. 

   Since then, investment officials estimate the equivalent of about $2 billion has been lent in gold to mining companies. 
Gold loans are an attractive form of debt because annual interest rates of between 1.5% and 3% are significantly lower than those charged on bank loans or bonds. 
Gold loans would be highly risky for nongold producers because gold prices could rise when the loan has to be repaid. 
Mining companies are protected from such risks as long as they can produce gold. 

   Rates are so low on gold loans because financial institutions are lending gold that would otherwise sit in vaults. 
Most commercial banks borrow gold from financial companies that own gold bullion or from central banks that act as agents for their governments' gold reserves. 
The U.S. doesn't lend its gold to commercial banks, but Canada and certain European and Asian countries do through their central banks. 

   Central banks and financial companies usually charge rates of less than 1% on gold loans and restrict their lending to major commercial banks. 
"It's a way of earning a return on gold. 
Otherwise, it just sits in the basement," said a spokesman for Bank of Canada, the country's central bank. 

   Some bankers and investment officials, however, are concerned about the increasing size of gold loans. 
Newmont's planned one-million ounce loan suprised some observers because it exceeds Newmont Gold's projected gold production of 930,000 ounces in 1988. 

   Although the gold can be repaid over several years, some bankers said Newmont Gold will be under much pressure to increase its gold output so that it can repay the debt without reducing its gold sales. 
Newmont Gold recently forecast that its annual gold production will rise to 1.6 million ounces by 1990. 

   "People are losing sight of the risks of gold loans," said one investment banker who declined to be identified. 
"What happens if a company has production problems and it can't produce gold at a time gold prices are rising? 
How will they repay the loan?" he asked.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it agreed to make an improved
offer to acquire the joint owners of a new gold property in a
move to head off a takeover bid by Placer Dome Inc.
   Corona also said it raised its holdings in the two
concerns, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime Resources Group
Inc., both of Vancouver, British Columbia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Toronto-based Corona said it plans to merge the two
companies into a new subsidiary to be created through the
spinoff of Corona's gold assets. Corona will retain a 50.2%
interest in the new company, to be known as Corona Gold Corp.
Corona will remain as a holding company with interests in oil
and gas, industrial minerals, gold and financial services.
   Corona said it advanced its restructuring plans by as much
as 18 months in response to a takeover bid for Stikine by
Placer. The Vancouver-based mining concern has offered 67.50
Canadian dollars (US$57.50) a share, valuing all of Stikine
at 229.5 million Canadian dollars.
   The takeover battle is being fought over the Eskay Creek
gold deposit located in northwestern British Columbia. The
property's estimated reserves to date total about 4.8 million
ounces of gold or equivalent, valued at about US$1.71
billion.
   Ned Goodman, Corona's chairman, said the company last week
bought more shares in Prime Resources, raising its stake to
45% from 21%. He said Corona obtained an option from
Stikine's principal holders that would boost its stake there
to 45%.
   Corona will offer 6.5 of its shares and two shares of
Corona Gold for each Stikine share. Stikine holders will be
eligible to receive, for each Corona share, 0.38 share of
Corona Gold as part of a special dividend payment to be made
to Corona holders.
   For each Prime share, holders will be entitled to receive
one Corona Gold share and one share of a successor company to
be known as Prime Equities Inc., which will comprise Prime
Resources' holdings in junior exploration concerns.

   Shareholders of Dome Mines Ltd., its Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. unit and Placer Development Ltd. approved a previously reported agreement to merge, creating North America's biggest gold mining concern. 

   The new company, Placer Dome Inc., expects to produce more than 800,000 ounces of gold this year, more than any gold producer outside South Africa and the Soviet Union, but only a small portion of world-wide gold production, which totaled 50.2 million ounces in 1986. 

   Placer Dome's shares were to be listed for trading today on stock exchanges in Toronto, Montreal and New York. 
The company has applied to list its shares on the Paris stock exchange and on exchanges in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Sydney, Australia. 

   Under terms of the merger, shareholders of the three concerns exchanged their holdings for Placer Dome shares at varying conversion rates, with one Placer Dome share equal to one share of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Placer Development. 
In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Placer Development closed at 26.125 Canadian dollars ($19.65), down 12.5 cents. 

   Placer Dome will have about 219.2 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about 5.7 billion dollars ($4.3 billion). 

   The merger gives Dome Mines substantial gold production outside of Canada and largely reduces the potential impact of a loan guarantee extended by Dome Mines to debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd. 
The merger also reduces the large oil and gas concern's 21.5% stake in Dome Mines to about 8% of Placer Dome. 

   Placer Development gains significant North American gold production to complement its holdings in Australia and New Guinea. 
Placer also gains a connection with Falconbridge Ltd., a large Toronto-based mining concern with interests in nickel, zinc and copper, in which Dome Mines held a 24.9% interest on a fully diluted basis. 

   Analysts generally approved of the merger. 
"It's the first of the new generation of gold mining companies to be a true multinational," said John Lydall of First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto. 

   Placer Dome has two head offices, in Toronto and Vancouver. 
Dome Mines Chairman Fraser Fell will continue as chairman of the new company. 
John Walton, president and chief executive officer of Placer, will retain the same posts at Placer Dome. 

   The merger ends efforts by another Toronto gold producer, Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd., to gain control of Dome Mines. 
Last week, Dome Petroleum rejected an offer by Giant Yellowknife to acquire its block of Dome Mines shares. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it "wouldn't rule out" the possibility that it may try to acquire a sizable position in Placer Dome.

   Scintilore Explorations Ltd., a Montreal-based mineral exploration firm, launched an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against several prospectors and companies involved in developing the province's Hemlo gold camp. 

   In its filing, Scintilore said it seeks an order that would give it assets and royalties currently received by the prospectors, John Larche and Donald McKinnon. 
Under terms of their agreements with the owners of two of Hemlo's three large gold mines, Messrs. 
Larche and McKinnon hold shares and cash and receive royalties on the mines' production. 

   Scintilore said that Mr. Larche, while indirectly employed by Scintilore in 1979 to stake properties in the then-undeveloped Hemlo area, "failed or refused" to do so, instead staking claims "for himself and for his own benefit." 
Scintilore alleged that Mr. McKinnon, who also was prospecting in the area, pooled his claims with Mr. Larche for "their joint benefit." 

   The prospectors subsequently sold some of the claims to Teck Corp. of Vancouver, International Corona Resources Ltd. of Toronto and Hemlo Gold Mines Inc. 

   Scintilore said it didn't become aware of "the material facts" until November of last year. 
Theodore Polisuk, president of Scintilore, declined to elaborate on the court filing. 

   Messrs. 
Larche and McKinnon couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 

   Teck jointly operates Hemlo's David Bell mine with International Corona. 
Hemlo Gold Mines is owner of the Golden Giant mine. 
Hemlo Gold is 50%-owned by Noranda Inc., Toronto. 

   Proceeds to the prospectors include 3% royalties on the mines' gold production. 
Messrs. 
Larche and McKinnon also hold 400,000 shares of Corona, about 2,660,000 shares of Hemlo Gold, and "substantial" cash, Scintilore said. 

   How much revenue accrues from the royalties wasn't clear. 
At the close of trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the shares had a combined market value of $89.3 million (Canadian). 

   Teck's president and chief executive officer, Norman Keevil Jr., said he hadn't been advised of the action and declined comment. 
Executives at Noranda and Corona weren't immediately available for comment.

   Australia's Western Mining Corp. Holdings Ltd. agreed to acquire the Canadian gold mining assets of Northgate Exploration Ltd. and plans to launch tender offers for two small Canadian gold concerns. 

   The transactions have a total indicated value of 259.7 million Canadian dollars ($198.7 million) and follow by four days Western Mining's proposed offer to acquire Seabright Resources Inc., another Canadian gold producer, for 92 million dollars. 

   Western Mining, Australia's largest gold mining concern, said the moves are part of its plan to form "a significant Canadian mining and exploration company." 
Hugh Morgan, Western Mining's managing director, said the proposed acquisitions would make up "the base" for future growth in Canada. 
He wouldn't say whether additional Canadian acquisitions are planned. 

   In addition to its agreement to acquire Northgate's mining unit for 160 million dollars, Western Mining said it plans to launch tender offers to acquire Norbeau Mines Inc. and Vancouver-based Grandview Resources Inc. Norbeau is 35%-owned by Northgate, which has agreed to tender its shares under the planned offer. 

   Through separate units, Western Mining said it would offer 22 cents a share, or a total 4.7 million dollars, for Norbeau, and 9.55 dollars a share, or a total 95 million dollars, for Grandview. 

   Western Mining said it reached agreement with certain Grandview directors and holders to tender their combined 15.5% fully diluted interest under the planned offer, which the company expects to make by Jan. 1. 
Western Mining currently holds 3.5% of Grandview's common shares. 

   The planned purchase of the Northgate unit, which comprises two Quebec mines that produce gold as well as silver and copper, is expected to close in late January. 
Northgate said the planned sale is an opportunity for it to "realize the intrinsic value" of the mines, which it purchased in 1981. 

   Northgate declined to estimate the size of an expected gain on the sale. 
The company said net proceeds of about 130 million dollars will be mainly used to finance gold mining acquisitions. 
Northgate said it will seek pure gold mines only. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Northgate closed at 8.375 dollars, up 1.00 dollar, and Norbeau closed at 15 cents, unchanged. 
Grandview closed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange at 8.50 dollars, up 1.50 dollars. 

   If successfully concluded, the proposed Canadian acquisitions would in 1988 give Western Mining additional gold output of at least 120,000 ounces, including about 80,000 ounces from Northgate's mines. 
James Capel &amp; Co., a London-based securities dealer, projects gold output of 471,000 ounces from Western Mining's current properties for the current fiscal year. 

   Western Mining's Mr. Morgan said additional gold production in Canada would most likely come from Seabright, which has large land holdings in Nova Scotia. 
He said it "has yet to be determined" whether Western Mining would merge the Canadian companies into one, once the proposed transactions are concluded.

   The Ontario Supreme Court dismissed a bid by LAC Minerals Ltd. for a new trial to determine ownership of the disputed Page-Williams gold mine, which the court awarded in 1986 to a predecessor of Corona Corp. 

   Ontario Supreme Court Justice Coulter Osborne isn't expected to release his reasons for the ruling until Friday, officials said. 
Justice Osborne disclosed his decision privately to attorneys yesterday, following a hearing that ended last week. 

   The ruling leaves LAC with one remaining avenue of legal recourse in its long battle with Corona, namely, an appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
LAC's appeal before the nation's highest court is due to conclude today, but a decision may not be rendered for months, company officials said. 

   "We're certainly pleased with the (Ontario court's) decision, but this is one heat only. 
The final is taking place in the Supreme Court of Canada," a Corona spokesman said. 
"So while this decision is positive, it's not conclusive." 

   Roland Francisco, LAC's senior vice president and treasurer, said Justice Osborne's ruling "doesn't change the complexion" of LAC, which excluded Page-Williams from its results after an appeals court last year upheld the 1986 Supreme Court of Ontario ruling. 

   In upholding the ruling, the appeals court agreed that LAC had in 1981 breached a trust with Corona's predecessor, International Corona Resources Ltd., regarding a joint exploration venture. 
The court said LAC used confidential information given by International Corona to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine now operates. 

   Toronto-based Corona, one of North America's biggest gold producers, was formed in July through the merger of International Corona and four affiliated companies. 

   In requesting a new trial, LAC said in its court filing that the initial decision in 1986 "was obtained by fraud consisting of perjured or intentionally misleading evidence" from Donald McKinnon, a prospector and agent of Corona's predecessor, International Corona. 
Mr. McKinnon testified at the original trial and also at the hearing that led to yesterday's ruling. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Corona's Class A shares closed at 9.625 Canadian dollars (US$9.97), up 25 Canadian cents. 
LAC closed at C$12.25, off 25 Canadian cents.

<HL> OTC Focus:
Shares Fall 2% in Slower Trading;
Decline Is Spread Evenly Through List

<TEXT>
   The over-the-counter market sank a bit yesterday. 
In fact, prices of most OTC stocks, and nearly every industry group, slumped about 2%. 

   That's unusual, because the OTC market is usually driven by its large technology sector, which makes volatile twists and turns; or by its huge complement of bank stocks. 
Not yesterday. 

   Computer stocks fell a little less in price than most industry groups, down slightly less than 2%. 
Apple Computer, the biggest OTC computer manufacturer, was off 1/2 at 37 1/4; Microsoft, the biggest OTC-traded software concern, was down 1/2 at 47. 
Bank stocks were also off about 2%. 

   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 5.96 points to 320.43, a 1.8% decline. 
Similar declines cut across such industry groups as insurance, telecommunications, biotechnology, industrial service, utility, paper, consumer product and retail stocks. 
Declining issues led advancers by about 2 1/3 to one on both Nasdaq and Nasdaq's National Market System, where most of the larger stocks trade. 

   That suggests the Monday gloom spread evenly through most sizes of stocks, including the small and medium issues, where bargain hunters have been sifting. 
Nasdaq volume slowed to 115.5 million shares yesterday, the lowest since Nasdaq trading hours were reduced to help brokers cope with post-crash volume. 
Traders said most bargain hunting went on hold yesterday, apparently to give investors time to assess the impact of the renewed weakness in the dollar on various stocks and industries. 

   Scattered groups with some immediate vulnerability to the dollar's problems were hit slightly harder than the rest of the market. 
The 31 Nasdaq-listed trucking companies, for example, slipped 4% yesterday. 
Roadway Services, the largest, dropped 1 1/2 to 30 1/4, a 4.7% decline; Yellow Freight Delivery was off 2 3/8 to 27 1/4, an 8% slide. 
Among the smaller truckers, Viking Freight fell 3/4 to 12 3/4; Circle Express was down 1/2 to 6; Marten Transport fell 3/4 to 6 1/4; Chemical Leaman was off 1 1/4 at 23 1/2; Freymiller Trucking fell 3/4 to 7 and Courier Dispatch slipped 1/4 to 3 1/2. 

   Even the usual beneficiaries of doom -- the gold stocks -- were hurt yesterday. 
Such stocks blossom with the threat of rising inflation that comes with increases in interest rates, the blow that usually sends U.S. stock prices reeling. 
But the weakening dollar brings recession fears, rather than inflationary ones, analysts say. 

   Thus, prices of the 67 Nasdaq gold stocks, on average, declined nearly 2% with the rest of the market yesterday, but the losers were all U.S. and Canadian-based mining companies. 
Among the larger U.S. gold mining stocks, Coeur d'Alene fell 1/4 to 16 1/4; U.S. Mineral Exploration was unchanged at 3 9/16, and Royal Gold fell 1/4 to 5 7/8. 
Among the biggest Canadian-based Nasdaq issues, Pegasus Gold fell 1/8 to 13 1/4; Galactic Resources was off 3/8 to 6 1/8 and Lacana Mining fell 3/8 to 8 3/8. 

   South African gold stocks, on the other hand, were up a bit yesterday. 
These issues are largely bought by non-U.S. investors on the London or Johannesburg stock exchanges, but some shares trade in the U.S. on Nasdaq. 
In U.S. trading yesterday, Free State Consolidated Gold Mining rose 1/4 to 12; Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining rose 1/8 to 5 1/2, and Gold Fields of South Africa was up 1/8 to 15.

   International Corona Corp. and Homestake Mining Co. said
they are discussing a possible merger.
   The companies wouldn't disclose the terms of the proposed
transaction. They said in a brief statement that they expect
to announce the outcome of the negotiations early next week.
Corona and Homestake officials declined further comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Homestake, which operates the oldest gold mine in the
U.S., a link with Corona would provide additional gold
reserves that are relatively cheap to mine, analysts say. At
the same time, a merger would help Corona clean up its
debt-heavy balance sheet and give it the financial muscle to
develop its rich Eskay Creek gold prospect in British
Columbia.
   Corona, a young company that has scrambled its way to the
top ranks of gold producers, bears little resemblance to the
more traditionally run Homestake. Corona, for instance, is a
proponent of gold loans as a means of raising cash. Homestake
shuns financing techniques that would prevent its stock from
serving as a proxy for buying bullion.
   "A merger makes a lot of sense to me as a very attractive
situation for both Homestake and Corona," said Vahid Fathi,
an analyst at Kemper Securities Group. Mr. Fathi said
concerns about cultural differences is a "luxury that they
can't afford."
   San Francisco's Homestake is one of the biggest gold
producers in the U.S., with output topping one million
ounces. Still, the company has had losses in the past two
years, largely because of the high cost of its mining
operations. Last year, Homestake had cash production costs of
about $300 an ounce of gold, more than $100 an ounce higher
than Corona's costs. A merged company would average out those
production costs.
   Corona, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, last year
produced about 700,000 ounces of gold. It owns some of the
richest gold properties in North America but is bogged down
by debt of some 320 million Canadian dollars (US$267.1
million). "Homestake certainly brings cash to the table,"
said John Phizackerley, an analyst at Lehman Bros. Homestake
had $160 million in cash at year end.
   Also involved in the merger discussions is Dundee Bancorp
Inc., a Toronto merchant bank that holds about 30% of
Corona's stock. A Corona spokesman said the companies made
the announcement at the request of the Toronto Stock Exchange
following a strong rise in Corona's share price. Trading in
Corona's shares was halted at C$4.50, up 30 cents.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Homestake shares were
quoted late yesterday at US$15, down 25 cents.

   Placer Begins Bid
   Of $193.8 Million
   For Gold Concern

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cash-rich Placer Dome Inc.
offered 229.5 million Canadian dollars (US$193.8 million) or
C$67.50 a share for Stikine Resources Ltd., 50% owner of
British Columbia's burgeoning Eskay Creek gold deposit.
   The offer, which begins today and expires June 19, is
expected to spark a battle with Toronto's Corona Corp. for
control of the rich deposit. Its reserves to date total 4.8
million contained ounces of gold or equivalent, worth about
US$1.76 billion at current spot prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We see it as very unfriendly. It caught us by surprise,"
said Peter Steen, Corona's chief executive officer. He said
Corona and Placer Dome were holding unspecified talks prior
to the offer; an analyst who declined to be indentified said
the companies were studying a possible joint venture at Eskay
Creek.
   The shares of Stikine, a small Vancouver-based exploration
outfit whose stock traded at less than C$1 a share just 18
months ago, rose sharply yesterday in Toronto Stock Exchange
trading, closing at C$68.50 each, up C$7.25 and C$1 above
Placer Dome's bid price. Placer Dome closed at C$19 a share,
unchanged.
   Currently, Corona owns 20% of Prime Resources Group Inc.,
Stikine's partner and the operator of the Eskay Creek
project, which is in northwestern British Columbia. Under a
complex plan announced in April, Corona proposes to secure
control of Eskay Creek by acquiring 44.6% of a new company
formed through the merger of Stikine and Prime.
   Corona's proposal, which still requires shareholder
approvals at meetings expected in July, calls for Stikine
holders to receive a package of securities, including Corona
shares, that analysts value at anywhere from C$65 to C$70 a
Stikine share.
   Placer Dome, a big gold producer whose cash holdings will
swell to about C$1 billion with the pending sale of its oil
and gas interests, said it views its bid as "superior" to
Corona's plan. As an alternative to its cash bid, Placer Dome
is also offering to swap 3.5 of its shares for each Stikine
share.
   Placer Dome's offer, if successful, would block the
planned merger of Stikine and Prime, which requires approval
from 75% of each company's shareholders to proceed. If more
than 25% of Stikine's shares are tendered to Placer Dome's
offer, therefore, analysts said Placer Dome could stymie the
merger plan, as well as Corona's effort to gain control of
Eskay Creek.
   Mr. Steen wouldn't say whether Corona would consider
sweetening the pot for Stikine shareholders, though investors
clearly expect a higher offer to come, in view of Stikine's
C$68.50 closing price yesterday.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.'s 92%-owned
Asamera Minerals Inc. unit said it is withdrawing plans to
sell its assets, citing depressed gold prices.
   The company's main asset is a 51% stake in the Cannon gold
and silver mine at Wenatchee, Wash., which last year produced
150,420 ounces of gold. Asamera said it won't resume efforts
to sell assets until gold prices rise and "the market
recognizes the value" of its holdings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Toronto-based Corona Corp., a big gold producer that
indirectly holds an interest in the Cannon mine through an
affiliate, Breakwater Resources Ltd., previously terminated a
pact under which it would have acquired most of Asamera's
assets, for stock valued at about 98.8 million Canadian
dollars (US$84.8 million). Other rumored bidders have failed
to materialize.
   Vancouver-based Breakwater, in which Corona holds a 27.6%
interest, owns 49% of the Cannon mine.
   Separately, Asamera appointed Russell Wood president and
chief executive, succeeding Bill Cooper, who is retiring. Mr.
Wood was president and chief executive for Copper Range Co.,
of White Pine, Mich., prior to its sale in 1989, Asamera
said.
   Gulf Canada, 74.3%-owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, is
selling certain assets to reduce debt.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc., a big
gold producer, said it plans to continue its previously
announced 229.5 million Canadian dollar (US$195.7 million)
offer to acquire Stikine Resources Ltd., half-owner of the
promising Eskay Creek gold project.
   The announcement, which followed last week's disclosure by
Placer Dome that it might withdraw its bid, sparked a sharp
jump in Stikine's share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Stikine shares closed yesterday at C$67.375, up C$3.875, on
volume of 186,009 shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Placer Dome disclosed late yesterday that it
acquired 40,600 additional Stikine shares in open-market
purchases on the Toronto exchange, raising Placer Dome's
stake in the company to 5.2%, from 4.7%. A spokesman wouldn't
say whether Placer Dome intends to make further open-market
purchases before its bid expires Tuesday.
   The share price of Stikine, a Vancouver-based gold
exploration company, had slumped after Placer Dome said it
might cancel its C$67.50-a-share offer, in view of a lock-up
agreement under which Stikine's 42% owners agreed to tender
their stock to a rival bidder, Corona Corp., a Toronto-based
gold producer.
   "The market has recognized that the Placer Dome offer is
superior to the Corona proposal," Anthony Petrina, Placer
Dome's president and chief executive officer, said. By
threatening to withdraw its bid, "They {Placer Dome} were
able to highlight the difference between their offer and
Corona's offer," said Barry Allan, gold analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd., Toronto.
   Corona has offered to swap 6.5 Corona Class A shares, plus
two shares of a newly created unit, Corona Gold Corp., for
each Stikine share. Stikine holders also would be eligible
subsequently to receive a special Corona Gold stock dividend.
   Analysts have had difficulty valuing Corona's offer, which
is part of a broad corporate reorganization plan by Corona.
But Mr. Allan said the lock-up pact, which calls for the
exchange of 8.5 Corona Class A shares for each Stikine share,
under certain conditions, established a "down-side" benchmark
for Corona's offer.
   Based on the C$7.375 closing price of Corona Class A
shares yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the
"downside" value of Corona's offer is about C$62.69 a Stikine
share.
   Corona already owns an interest in Eskay Creek through
45%-owned Prime Resources Group Inc., a Vancouver-based gold
exploration company. Prime owns 50% of Eskay Creek and
operates the gold project, which is in northwestern British
Columbia.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it ended a previously
reported agreement to sell its industrial mineral assets to
60%-owned Avalon Corp. but continues to negotiate the sale to
Avalon of its 17% interest in Poco Petroleums Ltd.
   The Toronto-based gold-mining company said the agreement
with Avalon was ended after a minority partner in one of
Corona's mineral properties decided to oppose the sale. The
transaction had been conditional on Avalon obtaining 100%
ownership of the assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Corona spokesman said he expects the sale of the Poco
Petroleums stake to be made at "close to market value,"
giving the transaction an indicated value of about 51.6
million Canadian dollars (US$44.1 million).
   Avalon, an energy exploration and production concern based
in New York, already holds as its main asset a 32% stake in
Poco Petroleums.
   As reported, Poco Petroleums is negotiating a merger with
Voyager Energy Inc. on a share-exchange basis. Avalon said

   Dome Petroleum Ltd. rejected an offer by Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd. to purchase its 21.5% stake in Dome Mines Ltd. for 448.6 million Canadian dollars ($339 million). 

   Dome Petroleum declined to comment on its reasons for rejecting the offer, but said it would vote its shares in favor of a previously reported plan to merge Dome Mines with two other gold mining concerns. 
Giant Yellowknife had planned to vote against the merger if it acquired the shares. 

   Shareholders of Toronto-based Dome Mines, its Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. subsidiary and Vancouver, British Columbia-based Placer Development Ltd. are scheduled to vote on the merger Wednesday. 
The combined concern would be North America's biggest gold mining company. 

   Dome Mines said it is "pleased that (Dome Petroleum) is supportive" of the merger plan. 
Placer said it is "pleased that the amalgamation can proceed as planned." 

   Giant Yellowknife, a Toronto-based gold mining company, had offered 21.50 Canadian dollars a share for the Dome Mines stake. 
Dome Mines closed Friday at 21 dollars, down 37.5 cents, in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

   Clifford Frame, chairman and chief executive officer of Giant Yellowknife, said he remains "convinced the merger is not in the interests of shareholders" of Dome Mines. 
He said Placer is a more "risk oriented" investment than Dome Mines, because much of its future gold production will come from mines in Papua New Guinea. 
All of Dome Mines' production is in Canada. 

   But Mr. Frame said Giant Yellowknife will drop plans to organize opposition to the merger and "wouldn't rule out" the possibility that Giant Yellowknife might seek to acquire a significant stake in the new company, if the merger plan goes through. 
He said Giant Yellowknife, whose offer would have been financed through a loan from a unit of its Australian parent, Ariadne Australia Ltd., will continue to seek "sizable acquisitions." 

   Dome Petroleum, as Dome Mines' largest holder, would wind up as the biggest shareholder in Placer Dome Inc., as the amalgamated company would be named, with a stake of about 8%.

<HL> Dickenson Mines Ltd. Plans Share Exchange For Wharf Resources </HL>

<IN> TNM </IN>
<DATELINE> TORONTO  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Kachmar, president and chief executive officer of Dickenson Mines Ltd., said the company expects to combine, through a share exchange, with 33%-owned Wharf Resources Ltd. 

   Terms will be disclosed at a later date. 
Dickenson expects to complete the planned transaction within 60 to 90 days. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dickenson closed at 7.75 Canadian dollars ($6.31) a share, down 25 cents; Wharf was unchanged at 6.125 dollars a share. 

   Mr. Kachmar said at the mining concern's annual meeting that the proposed transaction would create a gold-mining company with annual output of 135,000 ounces at a cash operating cost of $235 an ounce. 
Dickenson has a 65% stake in an underground mine at Red Lake, Ontario, from which it expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold this year. 
Dickenson also produces silver, lead, zinc and lime. 

   Wharf, Calgary, Alberta, owns an open-pit gold mine in South Dakota. 
Mr. Kachmar, named president and chief executive of Wharf in January after Dickenson acquired its stake, said he expects Wharf's mine to produce 70,000 ounces of gold annually once an expansion program is completed in the fourth quarter. 

   Mr. Kachmar said he is "confident" the proposed amalgamation will win shareholder approvals. 
He said Dickenson would likely offer less for the remaining Wharf shares than the price it previously paid. 
It paid an average 7.32 dollars a Wharf share for its current stake. 

   Separately, Mr. Kachmar said Dickenson is seeking additional acquisitions of gold companies or reserves in the U.S. comparable in size to Wharf. 
He said he is "optimistic" that an acquisition would be concluded in 1988. 

   Mr. Kachmar said he expects Dickenson's 1988 net income to be "in the ballpark" of 1987 net, which reached 6.4 million dollars ($5.2 million), or 44 cents a share, on revenue of 44.1 million dollars. 
Dickenson reported first-quarter 1988 net of 508,000 dollars, or four cents a share, down from net of 1.2 million dollars, or nine cents a share, in the prior-year period.

   Consolidated TVX Mining Corp. shareholders voted to
approve merging the company with the gold-mining subsidiary
of Inco Ltd.
   The combined company, to be called TVX Gold Corp., will be
62%-owned by Inco, a major nickel producer. Shareholders of
Consolidated TVX, which has interests in gold and silver
mines in Brazil and Chile, will own the remaining 38%.
Consolidated TVX and Inco are based in Toronto.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under terms of the agreement, Consolidated TVX will issue
83 million new shares to Inco. The deal has an indicated
value of about $415 million Canadian dollars (US$360
million), based on Consolidated TVX shares' closing price of
C$5, up 15 Canadian cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange
yesterday. The transaction was closed late yesterday.
   TVX Gold is expected to have 1991 production of about
350,000 ounces of gold and equivalent ore reserves containing
about seven million ounces, under a conversion ratio of 80
ounces of silver equal to one ounce of gold equivalent.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Poco Petroleums Ltd. said it acquired
a 32% stake in Voyager Energy Inc. for 43 million Canadian
dollars (US$37.1 million) and said it intends to pursue a
second attempt to merge with Voyager.
   Poco acquired 32% of Voyager's common and a further 29% of
its common purchase warrants outstanding from CanCapital
Corp., an investment and merchant banking concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Combining Poco and Voyager would create one of the top 12
Canadian oil and gas production concerns, analysts said, and
one of the largest independent producers. Together, the two
companies would have an indicated market value of about
C$425.4 million. They also would have a production capacity
of 150 million to 160 million feet of natural gas and 18,000
barrels of oil and liquids a day, Poco executives said.
   The first merger attempt was called off last year after
directors of the companies failed to reach agreement on
terms.
   "The current relative market and underlying values of the
companies should provide a basis for the successful
completion of a merger at this time," said Don Barkwell,
president of Poco. Voyager executives couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Vancouver-based Corona Corp., which has a 47% stake in
Poco, said it is pursuing plans to sell its Poco holdings to
reduce debt related to its Eskay Creek gold mining
operations. The proposed merger of Voyager and Poco "makes
the sale of the controlling block of Poco even more
attractive" to potential buyers, said Peter Steen, president
and chief executive of Corona. Corona executives said that
the sale process for its Poco interest is "well under way"
and that they hope to complete it "as soon as possible." They
declined to identify any potential buyers.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Poco
Petroleum closed at C$7.50 a share, unchanged. Shares of
Voyager Energy closed at C$4.80, up 45 Canadian cents.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Galactic Resources Ltd.
said it is considering acquiring DCC Equities Ltd., a
Toronto-based merchant bank, in a move that would give mining
financier Ned Goodman a major stake in Galactic.
   Terms of the transaction haven't been set, but the deal
likely will involve Galactic's issuing shares for "all or
substantially all" of the assets of DCC Equities, said Peter
Guest, president and chief executive officer of Galactic, a
gold mining concern based here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Closely held DCC is 52% owned by Dundee Capital Inc. of
Toronto with the rest held by a few institutions. Dundee, in
turn, is controlled by Mr. Goodman, its chairman and chief
executive, through direct shareholdings and through his
controlling stake in Corona Corp., a Vancouver-based gold
producer.
   "I believe he'll be a very good partner," Mr. Guest said
of Mr. Goodman, adding that Galactic's current management
would remain in place. "We needed to do something to really
get the company jump-started during these hard times."
   Low gold prices have sent Galactic seeking cash for
operations from outside sources. The company hit a snag in
its attempt to raise $10 million through a private placement
of shares, but Mr. Guest said he expects to complete the
offering in coming weeks.
   Although a share-exchange ratio hasn't been set, it
appears that DCC shareholders would hold a significant
portion of Galactic's share capital following the proposed
acquisition. With 46.9 million shares outstanding, Galactic
has a market capitalization of about $41 million, based on
yesterday's unchanged closing share price on the American
Stock Exchange of 87.5 cents.
   DCC holds equity investments with a current market value
of 140 million Canadian dollars (US$122.3 milion), the
company said.

<HL> Western Mining Unit Plans Bid to Acquire Western Goldfields </HL>

<TEXT>
   A Western Mining Corp. Holdings unit plans to offer 11.25 Canadian dollars a share, or about 95.2 million dollars ($73.8 million), to acquire Toronto-based Western Goldfields Inc. 

   The two companies said in a statement that the unit, WMC Acquisition Inc., holds 1.7% of Western Goldfields' 8.5 million common shares outstanding. 
They said a group that holds a combined stake of 41% in Western Goldfields has agreed to tender its shares under the planned offer. 

   Western Mining said it hopes to proceed with the offer within two weeks. 
If successful, the transaction would close by the end of February. 

   Western Goldfields officials weren't available for comment. 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the company's shares closed at 10.75 dollars, up 2 dollars. 

   Western Mining's proposed acquisition would be its fifth in Canada since mid-December, when it announced bids for three other small Canadian gold mining and exploration concerns, and an agreement to buy gold assets of another company in a private transaction. 
These transactions are expected to close by Feb. 1. 

   Including the proposed Western Goldfields acquisition, the transactions have a combined value of about 446.9 million dollars ($346.6 million). 

   Western Mining, Australia's biggest gold producer, has said the moves are part of its plan to build "a significant Canadian mining and exploration company." 
The proposed acquisition of Western Goldfields, which operates a small open-pit mine in Nevada, would raise to about 250,000 ounces the expected output of its combined North American properties in 1988, a Western Mining spokesman said. 

   Separately, Western Goldfields said it agreed to sell its 18.4% stake in Vancouver-based Delaware Resources Corp. to a group of Western Goldfields shareholders for 8.25 dollars a share, or 13 million dollars. 
Delaware Resources has several gold properties in western Canada.

   Golden Shield Resources Ltd. said it agreed to acquire Kerr Addison Mines Ltd.'s Virginiatown, Ontario, gold mine and its interest in two gold mining properties for $38 million (Canadian) in cash and securities. 

   Golden Shield, a mining concern, said the purchase price includes $15 million in cash. 
Kerr Addison also will receive debentures and common shares of Golden Shield equal to a 25% interest. 
Kerr Addison said it will receive an option to purchase additional Golden Shield common shares that could boost its stake to 40%. 

   Consolidated TVX Mining Corp., Brazil, is currently Golden Shield's largest shareholder, with a 25% interest. 
Kerr Addison is 49.4%-owned by Toronto-based Noranda Inc., a forest products, mining and manufacturing concern. 

   Ian Bayer, president and chief executive officer of Kerr Addison, said the transaction will "enhance the value" of the Virginiatown mine to Kerr Addison, which has interests in precious and base metals mining and oil and gas. 
Proceeds from the transaction will be used for general purposes, he said. 

   Mr. Bayer said the transaction, scheduled to close June 30, would reduce Kerr Addison's expected 1987 gold output to 100,000 ounces from 140,000 ounces.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
backed out of a plan to jointly develop a rich British
Columbia gold deposit, leaving debt-burdened International
Corona to seek other means of raising the 210 million
Canadian dollars (US$183.8 million) needed to finance the
project.
   Fears that Corona could be stuck with all of the bill for
Eskay Creek hurt the company's share price. Yesterday, in
trading on the American Stock Exchange, the shares closed at
$4.625, down 37.5 cents. Placer Dome shares closed in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $10.50,
off 50 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corona, which already has invested about C$300 million in
Eskay Creek, has total debt of about C$380 million.
   But Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive
officer, said, "I don't think we'll have any trouble
financing the project." He said that currently the company is
talking with two other gold-mining concerns about putting
money into Eskay Creek, which is expected to begin production
in early 1994. Corona also will seek bank financing after
completing an economic-feasibility study next year, he said.
   Exploration so far has outlined an estimated three million
ounces of gold at Eskay Creek, valued at about $1.08 billion
at current market prices. Production costs are projected to
be less than $150 an ounce, one of the lowest cost structures
in the industry.
   Placer Dome agreed that the deposit could become a
profitable gold mine. However, the company said it objected
to the proposed joint-venture agreement, which would have
saddled Placer with repaying all the capital costs while
receiving just 50% of the mine's cash flow. Placer spokesman
Hugh Leggatt said the company estimated that it wouldn't
begin to see a profit from the mine until after six years.
The mine is expected to have a relatively short lifespan of
eight years.
   Under the now-defunct plan, cash-rich Placer had agreed to
build the mine in exchange for increasing its stake in the
deposit to 50% from the current 22%. Corona's interest would
have dropped to about 25% from 45%.
   But Corona's Mr. Steen estimated the mine's capital costs
could be repaid in two years using 100% of the cash flow. He
forecast that the mine would produce 250,000 ounces of gold a
year, ranking it among the 10 biggest gold mines in North
America.
   Placer Dome said Corona has the right for the next 90 days
to buy Placer's stake in Eskay Creek for C$105 million.
Failing that, Placer said it could swap its Eskay Creek
interest for shares in Corona or sell it to another party. A
Corona spokesman said it's unlikely Corona would buy Placer's
holding at that price.
