<TEXT>     "I want to promote my culture and history," he said. "I'm proud of my Latin
ancestry.";   Viveros, 34, paints the plumed serpent and other Aztec symbols
-- idols, warriors and sacrificial rituals -- on paper amate. The paper and
technique are more than 3,000 years old, but artists had abandoned the
procedure until Viveros discovered paper amate, made from the bark of a
Mexican tree, about two years ago while wandering through a bazaar in Mexico.;
  The paintings of flowers and birds were geared toward tourists, yet the
ancient paper appealed to Viveros.;   "There was something in my mind that
said this art is new and original," he said.;   Viveros said he doesn't know
of any other artists in the United States who use paper amate.;   "I'm
rescuing the technique so we can be proud of our Pre-Columbian ancestors,"
said Viveros, who was born and raised in Xalapa in the state of Veracruz.;  
Paper amate is crushed bark from amatl trees, which thrive in tropical weather
and only grow in Puebla in central Mexico and parts of Africa and the
Philippines. Viveros travels to Mexico about twice a year to buy the paper.
The paper, which costs $5 for a 14-inch-by-18-inch sheet, is handmade by
Indians, who strip the bark from trees and then smash the bark between a stone
and wood to create brown, white or cinnamon paper.;   The paintings are done
with a Pre-Columbian technique, but using acrylics. Bright and unblended
colors are used for the paintings. "The colors come alive on the paper," he
said.;   In his Campbell home studio, he creates symbolic paintings of the
Aztecs on paper amate. The paintings are displayed on a living room wall.;  
Viveros was a graphic designer in Mexico for two years before he moved to San
Jose in 1979. He is a graduate of the National School of Plastic Arts at the
University of Mexico in Mexico City. He takes sculpture, ceramic and metal
design classes at West Valley College. But to support himself as an artist, he
works full time at a Safeway store in East San Jose.;   Although Viveros also
creates surrealistic oil and acrylic paintings, pencil drawings and bronze
sculpture figurines, he now concentrates on paper amate because of the
attention from the public. At a recent exhibit of his artwork at the
Biblioteca Latino Americana, 690 Locust St., San Jose, people were most
interested in paper amate, he said. "Looking at these paintings makes people
proud of our Latin heritage," he said.;   Viveros teaches paper amate to
students at library-sponsored workshops and instructs a weekly class for the
Sunnyvale School District.;   During the workshops, Viveros tells students
about the Aztecs, a highly civilized group of Indians who lived in Mexico from
about 1200 to 1521, the year that Hernando Cortes led Spanish troops to
conquer the Aztecs.;   Viveros touches upon the ancient group's reputation as
warriors, their religious practices which included human sacrifices and their
gods. "I want the kids to realize that there was life before Christopher
Columbus," Viveros said. "I teach the kids about their Latin American culture
and then they show their knowledge through the paintings.";   Viveros said he
hopes the workshops offer a positive outlet for teens to speed their free
time. "A lot of kids have nothing else to do with their spare time, which
leads to gangs and trouble," he said. "I want kids to come to my workshops and
feel positive about themselves.";   He recently taught a workshop to 11
students at the Biblioteca Latino Americana. The free workshops are sponsored
by friends of the library groups. Viveros will teach a four-week workshop
beginning Dec. 10 at the Empire Library in East San Jose.;   The students'
paintings will be exhibited through Dec. 31. At the Biblioteca Latino
Americana during an artist reception last week, Jose Aquirre, 18, talked about
the meaning behind his painting to approximately 30 admirers. He painted a
skeleton, Indians, an eagle and Aztec gods.;   "When I think about Mexico, I
think about what's in my painting," said the De Anza College student.;   Mark
Lopez, 15, combined his drawing talent and architect career ambition to paint
a group of pyramids. "I learned about the Aztec culture and their life," said
Lopez, a sophomore at Pioneer High School in San Jose.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED;
Manuel Viveros will teach a four-week paper amate workshop for teens from 4 to
6 p.m. on Dec. 10, Dec. 17, Jan. 14, and Jan. 21. There will be a reception
for artists on Jan. 28 at the Empire Library, 491 E. Empire St. To register,

Forest Lawn, the cemetery outfit that brought you replicas of Leonardo da 
Vinci's "Last Supper" in stained glass and Michelangelo's "David" in marble, 
has added an attraction at its memorial park in the Hollywood Hills: copies of 
ancient Mexican artifacts in sandstone, concrete and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
The park's Plaza of Mexican Heritage, completed in 1987, includes full-scale 
copies of mosaics, sculptures and glyphs from the Olmec, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, 
Toltec, Mayan, Aztec, Huastec and Totonac cultures. 
</P>
<P>
There's a circular calendar stone copied from one found buried in Mexico City, 
a sacrificial chacmool figure from the ruins at Chichen Itza, a bas-relief from 
the ball court at El Tajin, and a god of pulque, the pungent fermented wine 
said to have led to the downfall of Quetzalcoatl, the priest-leader of Tula. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza also features subtropical plants native to the lush environment of 
southern Mexico and desert plants from the arid areas of northern Mexico.

'BUSCANDO AMERICA' FINDS A PARODISTIC BRILLIANCE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: AN AZTEC GOD WHO AWAKENS IN LOS ANGELES GENERATES A MULTITUDE OF 
INTERESTING SITUATIONS. ITS LIMITATIONS ASIDE, THE PLAY SUCCEEDS IN SHOWING THE 
SHALLOWNESS OF MODERN VALUES.

<P>
What happens when an Aztec god who has lost his powers wakes up on a Los 
Angeles street and nobody recognizes him? For one thing, you get an allegorical 
sendup of Latino culture that unfolds at times with brilliant parodistic 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
The central premise of Roy Conboy's "Buscando America/Seeking America," which 
opened Thursday at Rancho Santiago College, couldn't be more pointed in its 
intention to satirize not only the shallowness of contemporary values but also 
the god's inflated vanity and injured pride. 
</P>
<P>
The play does this by exploiting the screwball misunderstandings engendered in 
the basic situation -- which is not unlike the landing of a dumbfounded Martian 
-- multiplying them from one scene to the next with a lowly taco vendor, a pair 
of star-struck Hollywood tourists, a macho drug dealer and his girlfriends, a 
rich woman unsatisfied by her wealth and an imperious magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest scene by far depicts the god Quetzalcoatl's confrontation with 
Carlos the drug dealer, a strutting vato who worships money, women and his 
immaculately polished, "chariot de oro" pickup truck -- not necessarily in that 
order. The humor is greatest here because it cuts closest to the bone (with no 
small thanks to Eddie Rivera's exaggerated performance as Carlos). 
</P>
<P>
But as enlightenment begins to dawn on Quetzalcoatl, whose quest to regain his 
former powers provides the play with its satirical thrust, it becomes all too 
apparent that "Buscando America" is trying for pathos as well as bitng social 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Conboy is much less successful at engaging our pity than our 
laughter -- mainly because the writing loses its tension and the tone becomes 
self-indulgent when it takes aim at the tragic dimensions of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mythic legend at the heart of the play -- Quetzalcoatl's conflict 
with his brother god Tezcatlipoca -- is established in absurdist terms as an 
Orwellian thriller replete with Big Brotherish video newscasts and 
pistol-toting assassins in trench coats and aviator sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is played against the vivid backdrop of a huge billboard depicting 
a black cityscape silhouetted by a bright, yellow sky and big, bouncy letters 
proclaiming: "Hello from Los Angeles." On either side of the billboard are two 
painted skeletons. The stage floor bears the death's-head emblem of an enormous 
white skull. The blend -- while inventive and visually rich -- just does not 
lends itself to pathos. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, in the meantime, shows the intense enthusiasm of amateurs imbued with 
belief, if not always with polish. As Quetzalcoatl, Michael San Roman brings 
great comic warmth to his performance. Laurie Woolery, who plays Tezcatlipoca 
in various guises -- including the taco vendor, a bus driver, and a corrupt 
major domo -- has a certain furious presence. 
</P>
<P>
Like Woolery, the other cast members also play multiple roles. Rivera stands 
out, though, with his pricelessly overdone strut as the drug dealer. Also 
notable is Jo Bond's gavel-pounding magistrate, a cartoonish figure who 
purposely can't pronounce Quetzalcoatl's name. 
</P>
<P>
As the playwright, Conboy could have used more help than he has received to 
date at the various workshops where the script has been developed. The script 
still needs to be trimmed of unnecessary repetitions as well as confusing 
inconsistencies. But he clearly has a work-in-progress worth refining. As the 
director, Conboy cannot be faulted. His staging is sharp and highly theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it ought to be said that this production of "Buscando America" 
represents something of a triumph as the maiden outing for the new 
multicultural troupe Cucucuevez, especially given its minimal financial 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
'BUSCANDO AMERICA/SEEKING AMERICA'

CUCUCUEVEZ IS PRESENTING A COMEDY ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF THE ANCIENT TOLTEC

A new multicultural theater troupe called Cucucuevez is being formed in Orange 
County and will present the world premiere of Garden Grove playwright Roy 
Conboy's comedy, "Buscando America," as its first production in August. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Conboy, who will be the artistic director, said Friday that the 
troupe "will be established for the long term" by a group of about 15 writers, 
directors and performers representing "Latinos, Anglos and Asians." 
</P>
<P>
The first production -- described as "a comedy about the adventures of the 
ancient Toltec god Quetzalcoatl in modern-day Los Angeles" -- will be staged at 
Rancho Santiago College's Little Theatre West in Santa Ana for two weeks, 
beginning Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have a permanent home for a while," said Conboy, a former general 
manager and casting director of the Grove Shakespeare Festival. "Among 
ourselves, we think of what we're doing as 'art on the run.' " 
</P>
<P>
The troupe, an outgrowth of the college's New Plays and Players Workshop, will 
receive logistics support from Rancho Santiago's theater department but will 
have to raise $5,000 on its own to pay for staging "Buscando America." 
</P>
<P>
"We took the name Cucucuevez (koo-koo-KWE-ves) from the name of a homeless 
child who was found abandoned on the street by a man on his way home from 
work," Conboy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be identified with the values that gave that child a home and 
allowed her to live and prosper," he added. "Her story also poses the question 
of how we balance the values that our culture handed down to us with the 
necessities of modern existence." 
</P>
<P>
Conboy's play has received staged readings at South Coast Repertory in the 
Hispanic Playwrights Project and at other workshops in Seattle and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Cruz Gonzalez, the director of the Hispanic Playwrights Project, will also 
be a founding member of the new troupe, Conboy said. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes from "As Is," which played the Forum Theatre in Laguna Beach last winter 
and subsequently transferred to the Comedy Store Playhouse in Los Angeles, will 
be featured on "Entertainment This Week" at 6 p.m. Sunday on KNBC-Channel 4 as 
part of a segment about one of its actors. 
</P>
<P>
David Napier, who played a role in William Hoffman's bittersweet play about 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is the focus of the segment. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Wong, who produced the segment, said it talks about how Napier copes with 
the disease in real life and how he feels playing someone with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Five actors who have previously appeared at the Grove Shakespeare Festival will 
co-star with actress Kelly McGillis in a benefit performance at the Festival 
Amphitheatre to help match a $50,000 Irvine Foundation challenge grant, it was 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis, who was recently appointed to the classical theater's board of 
trustees, will be joined in "A Midsummer Night's Eve at the Grove" on July 30 
by Gregory Itzin, John-Frederick Jones, Daniel Bryan Cartmell, Carl Reggiardo 
and Kamella Tate. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, assembled by the Grove's producing artistic director, Thomas F. 
Bradac, will give readings and perform scenes from a handful of Shakespeare's 
plays, including "The Taming of the Shrew," "Romeo and Juliet," "Henry V" and 
"Julius Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old theater company also hopes to raise money with a 
pre-performance dinner to be attended by the cast and with a gallery exhibit of 
paintings by artist Jean Pol d. Franqueuil in the Village Green Courtyard.

   A museum in southeastern Mexico offers clues to
three civilizations that predate the Aztecs. Among other things,
there is evidence that these ancient people probably perceived the
earth as round, designed remarkably accurate calendars and had an
advanced knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.

   Huge carved stone heads, tiny clay figures
and thousands of other artifacts at a museum here tell a strange
story about three civilizations that flourished long before
Columbus discovered America.
   It's about the Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecs, who inhabited a
long stretch of coast on the Gulf of Mexico.
   The fascinating and sometimes gruesome story is told vividly at
the Museum of Xalapa, which specializes in the region's
archaeological treasures.
   A lot is still unknown about the three civilizations. They are
believed to have been part of a series of migrations from Asia that
started about 35,000 years ago across the Bering Strait, by way of
Alaska, and lasted several millenia.
   But, says museum director Fernando Winfield Capitaine, ``as new
finds are made and studies of old ones shed new light, the results
may rewrite quite a few history books.
   ``We don't know what their language was, or what they even
called themselves,'' he adds. ``Even the names we use for them are
false and relatively new. They are `nahuatl' names, the trading
language of the Aztecs, which didn't even exist at the time.''
   Only 3,000 of the museum's 29,000 pieces are on display for lack
of space. They tell how these people performed human sacrifices,
probably perceived the earth as round, designed remarkably accurate
calendars and had an advanced knowledge of mathemathics and
astronomy, among other things.
   The artifacts range in size from a tiny Olmec carving of a rain
god 4 inches high, to huge stone altars. The museum's centerpiece
is a monolithic head 9 feet high and weighing 16 tons, carved from
andesite rock.
   Now housed in a new $3 million set of modern buildings covering
14,400 square yards and surrounded by eight acres of wooded park,
the museum is part of the Veracruz state university in Xalapa, the
state's capital 74 miles northwest of the port of Veracruz.
   The Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecas based their agriculture on
corn, frijole beans and squash, supplementing their diets with dog
meat, river fish and wild animals and birds, which they seasoned
with chili peppers, herbs and other spices.
   Both their weapons and their tools were crude, mostly made out
of stone or wood, and no one is sure how they carved such huge
stone statues. But their civilizations were surprisingly advanced
for its time.
   In his guidebook ``Master Works of the Xalapa Museum,'' Mexican
anthropolgist Alfonso Medellin Zenil says it's possible the Olmecs
were the first to make paper out of wood pulp in America.
   Archaeologists believe the political organization was more of a
loose coalition of small towns or city-states than one big
government entity. But their influence spread far and wide and some
of it survives in present-day Mexico.
   They could read and write and knew what a wheel was, but didn't
use it, probably because they had no draft animals. Their ancestors
had hunted them all out of existence, including the ancient
American horse and the elephant.
   They spun and wove fibers, including cotton. They tailored their
clothes, wore earrings and jewelry, blackened their teeth with
natural tar for cosmetic purposes and made rubber from the rubber
tree, which is native to the region.
   Being cross-eyed was considered a sign of beauty.
   By polishing metallic rock, the Olmecs made flat mirrors which
they hung over their chests as jewelry, or concave ones, which they
used to light fires.
   They made music on drums, whistles, ocarinas, clay flutes and
other instruments. They traveled and traded extensively, as far
west as the Pacific Coast and as far south as El Salvador in
Central America, spreading their cultures and acquiring new ones.
   As a result, cacao _ the bean from which chocolate is derived
and is native to the Gulf Coast _ became a popular currency for
trade throughout pre-Columbian Mexico.
   At first, they cremated or simply buried their dead, but later
they built little pyramidal rock mounds to mark the sites. Later
still, they built the monumental pyramids that survive today.
   They played a ceremonial sport with a rubber ball, which was a
combination of soccer and basketball. The winning team was
afterwards beheaded as a sacrifice, usually to a sun god, although
some authorities claim it was the losers who lost their heads.
   Other victims had their hearts cut out atop some pyramid or
other sacred altar. Some were skinned alive and priests donned
their skins to dance before Xipe Totec, the ``god of the flayed,''
in a fertility rite to mark the beginning of spring.
   Prisoners of war often had their hands severed so the victors
could acquire their strength, skill and magic.
   Worship was centered on the sun, the moon and the planet Venus.
   All three cultures worshipped the jaguar as a sun god and
hunting the animal was forbidden, except for its skins, which
priests wore during sacred ceremonies. The jaguar was often
depicted in partly human form.
   It was said that in times long past a woman mated with a jaguar,
giving birth to a ``were-jaguar.'' Archeologists believe this
explains the Olmecs' morbid fascination with dwarfs, hunchbacks and
other human deformations.
   Little is known about Venus, usually depicted as the lesser of
the three, except that Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl, god of the hurricane
and other winds, and Xochiquetzal, goddess of love and the spring,
were probably associated with it.
   The most fascinating of the moon deities was Tlasolteotl, the
Totonaca goddess of confession, protectress of childbirth and
advocate of illicit love and passions. She encouraged people to sin
so that she could later absolve them.
   Sinners had to confess to her, so that she could devour the
``rubbish or spiritual garbage'' that weighed upon them.
   ``But,'' says Winfield, ``only one confession was allowed in a
lifetime, and people tried to put it off as much as they could,
since there was no forgiveness for a second offender.''

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: All eyes on Mayfest - A preview of the Glasgow
galleries participating in this month's festivities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE few years since its inception, Glasgow's Mayfest has become an
important fixture in the British cultural calendar. Natural civic pride and
rivalry apart, it is hardly yet the equal of Edinburgh as an international
festival of the arts, but who would now say, with enthusiasm on the one
side, and complacency on the other, that a full reversal of the relative
positions was impossible?
So far as the visual arts are concerned, the issue is already nicely
balanced. Glasgow may not yet boast the major exhibitions which Edinburgh's
museums have always the good sense to offer at festival time, with the city
full of visitors. But that effort is usually qualified by a wish to distance
it from the Festival as such, opening particular shows well beforehand and
running them on long afterwards. As for the Festival authorities, their
current advance literature is innocent of any reference to the visual arts
at all.
But Mayfest has always integrated the visual element into its programme.
This year there may be no single outstanding offering, but across the
spectrum, from public to private, some 15 galleries are participating, with
all but two of them open by this weekend, and a further eight listed in
association.
To try the flavour, I visited four shows, one of which, at the Collins
Gallery (22 Richmond Street: until June 6), with the opening due on Friday
night, was on Thursday morning but a flurry of carpentry, paint and
wallpaper and a gleam in the artist's eye. 'Access', by Jim Buckley, is to
be an installation that takes further the images he first developed in his
sculpture. This he based on the old peepshow principle, making boxes with
interiors that proposed their own imaginative scale and reality.
Here, in one darkened gold-papered room, Buckley has set into the wall four
large display transparencies taken from the boxes he showed in Kunst Europa
in Germany last year, the images imagined, richly decorated, sanctuary-like
interiors. The other room, white and light, holds seven peepholes through
which to view photographic details of actual architectural interiors found
in the city itself.
Cyril Gerber was the first dealer to bring modern and contemporary art to
Glasgow, and he stands naturally at the heart of Mayfest. At his personal
gallery (148 West Regent Street: until May 23) he shows Benjamin Creme, a
Glaswegian painter now 70 but long neglected. The work here is of the 1940s,
when Creme was taken up by the emigre Polish painters Josef Herman and
Jankel Adler then living in Glasgow, and the 1950s when he was in London and
one of the circle of Minton, MacBryde, Colquhoun and others. The figure
drawings and paintings are especially interesting, sophisticated in their
modernism, after Braque and Matisse, yet direct and personal in feeling and
character.
Up the road at his Compass Gallery (178 West Regent Street: until May 21),
Gerber is showing the recent work of a most distinctive Scottish
print-maker, Elspeth Lamb. With her 'Cornerstones', she offers us the fruit
of a recent visit to Mexico where she was particularly taken both by the
popular festivals of the Day of the Dead and the ancient architectural
carvings and hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan and Quetzalcoatl.
But what makes her show remarkable is not so much the imagery as the medium
by which she has developed and quite literally expressed it. Making the
paper herself, saturating the pulp with pigment, she at once simplifies and
concentrates the image while impressing it into the very fabric of her
material. The paper is itself the image: and rich and dense and beautiful
too.
The Transmission Gallery (28 King Street) is a co-operative run by a
changing committee of five artists to show not their own but the work of
artists they would wish to see. Throughout May it offers a group show - a
collaborative relief-cum-lightwork by Paul Maguire and Simon Starling,
consisting of three isometric cubes, small, medium and large, described by
white neon tubes; four cibachrome prints of a leather holster, by Michael
McDonough; and a set of of ironically dispassionate photographs of taped and
sand-bagged windows, taken in Zagreb last November by Donald Urquhart.
Small, black and white, the format insistent in its simple frontality, the
plastic bags oddly disturbing in the way they are heaped and trussed, they
are rather impressive.

name. David Childress, a D-Q spokesman, says Deganawidah is a hero in Indian
culture. He says the Mohawk tribe uses the name in its religious ceremonies
and asked the college not to use it in its name. The school complied in 1977.
Childress says Quetzalcoatl is a South American Indian mythical god of

sandwiches." The coupon had a picture of a huge sandwich printed on it. I took
it into a Subway location to get my free sandwich and was told the coupon is
only redeemable for sandwiches up to $2.49. A $2.49 sandwich is about equal to
mustard on a bun. The manager refused to fill my order for a six-inch sandwich
(excluding double meat and double cheese). This sure sounds like the old bait

band together. A coupon should be redeemable for what it says.;    -- Roger

received a free six-inch sandwich at any participating Subway location,
regardless of whether the sandwich is valued at more than $2.49. You didn't
specify which location you went to, so he's not sure if you went to a
participating spot. Abbott is making sure all franchise owners are aware that
people with those Blockbuster coupons are supposed to receive a free sandwich.

<TEXT>     And a good thing too.;   Bibliophiles and art lovers have a treat in a show
that speaks volumes at the Cal State Hayward art gallery. Under the guest
curatorship of Judith Hoffberg of Pasadena, 140 contemporary artists have
contributed works for "Cross Currents: Bookworks from the Edge of the
Pacific.";   There's a whole category of art that takes its inspiration from
the idea of the book. In this show, some creations barely touch base with the
book notion before whirling off into metaphor. Some "books" are pages strung
on lines, the individual sheets revealing as much as personal laundry hung
out.;   Others flip open like a child's toy, fan out in accordion pleats or
are folded to represent the sail shapes of the Sydney (Australia) Opera House.
You'll find book as political statement, book as intimate personal journey.
The book as object -- say, decorative books in model homes -- is represented
by bricks stamped like book bindings.;   "There's lots of energy here," said
Lew Carson, gallery director, noting the contrast between high- and low-tech
works. The printing technology ranges from hand lettering and wood blocks to
Xerox and laser prints. Covers are stamped leather, carved wood, handmade
papers.;   Some of the volumes are fragile, but the show is color coded with
dots marking which books may be opened by the viewer and which should be taken
to the attendant. The curator has thoughtfully provided 100 sets of white
cotton gloves for handling the books.;   Thirteen countries are represented in
the show. The rich mix includes a Russian artist living in Seattle, a Czech in
Australia, a Chinese artist living in the United States who must exhibit
anonymously for safety reasons. Artists living on the Pacific Rim have a
different sensibility from those in New York, Hoffberg believes. In the
introductory statement, she writes: "There is something deeply spiritual about
the Pacific Rim; it is as if the spirals uncoiled, joining us all to each
other, with a binding that is not tight, but which loosely affects us all.";  
The book show is to be read at many levels. The Chinese political piece, "A
Page in History, 1989," depicts events surrounding the Tiananmen Square
massacre. The images are recorded as black and white photocopied news photos
spread on a scroll of rice paper evoking the sense of a roll of film
unfolding.;   Among the visual treats are Michael Tuffery's wooden cover with
carved tortoise, lizard and crab and Sonya Rapoport's "Chinese Connection," a
string of bright illustrations and commentary on how the mind and eye work.
Ismael Vargas' feathery Mexican stand-up piece "Quetzalcoatl in New York"
leads the eye right to the bright pop and religious images of "La Bomba" by
Ecuadoran artist Marco Alvarado Lopez.;   Barbara Pucci's small book "Janson:
His Story" is a commentary on the author of the best-known college art history
text, infamous for ignoring women. Among pages of her own illustrations and
text on art history, the artist has inserted blank pages inscribed with such
statements as, "About women from classical Greece, Janson says: Nothing." And
so on through the great ages of art, Janson continues to say: "Nothing.";  
The show is one vast reading room of commentary within commentary. Having
begun in Santa Barbara, it continues through Oct. 25 at Cal State, then moves
to Florida, Australia and Japan.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Gallery hours are
Monday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Thursday, 1 to 7 p.m., Saturday,
1 to 4 p.m. Closed Friday and Sunday. The gallery is on the first floor of the
Arts and Education Building of the Cal State Hayward campus. For information,

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Cultures before Columbus - An ancient art with a
modern feel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of
considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America
may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new
worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are
demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods'
from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered.
There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and
worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other
cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival
of the Spanish. The works have been assembled from the major public
collections of Mexico, judiciously supplemented by the British Museum
(Museum of Mankind).
It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican
art in London, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront
cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting
reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art
stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even
historical mindset.
A palma of Brancusi-like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as
pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function. A Totonac
sculptor carves a head in which only one half of the face is shown, the
other half left undefined and emerging from its stone casing. It is all one
can do to resist images of Michelangelo's bound figures in the Louvre. The
Chac Mool reclining on his elbows, was so thoroughly imbibed by Moore that
it seems here strangely familiar and modern. So too the Huastec sculptures
and a Veracruz jaguar mask which have a futuristic primitivism that is pure
Star Wars. Mexico can surely boast some of the most alien of all human art
and it is no accident that Eric von Daniken found here so much fodder for
his extra terrestrial dreamings.
Mayan art, widely regarded as the high-point of the Precolumbian
achievement, took the decorative and iconographic principles established by
the Olmecs in the centuries before Christ to a new level of delicacy and
refinement. Jaina ceramic figurines of a women, priests and warriors are
exquisite genre studies whose faces are to be seen all over the Yucatan to
this day. Jade was exploited to lavish effect in relief carvings and, most
spectacularly, in human masks. The so-called 'eccentric flints', fashioned
by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms,
remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece
of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a
remarkable facility for two-dimensional naturalism - an unexpected foil to
the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism.
One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the
revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of
the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Since the script is itself a pictorial code
whose understanding is intimately linked to the symbolism of Mayan art, this
new insight lifts a veil from Mayan iconography too. As in Egypt, much
ancient Mexican art needs to be deciphered in as precise and literal a way
as writing. The more official and ceremonial pieces are interspersed with
pottery and other items of everyday use, including rare wood-carvings. These
are much more spontaneous and imaginative, showing the exuberance of the
household or village craft tradition. In the human- and animal-shaped
vessels of the Colima potters lies a virtual menagerie of local wildlife and
domestic scenes - a baby, an emaciated hunchback, an acrobat - keenly
observed with real sympathy and inventively adapted to shapes that can also
function as vessels.
The show has been laid out with a keen eye for design and lighting, with
adequate wall tests including evocative quotations from ancient Mexican
texts. The designers have made the most of an awkward ramp at the entrance
by arranging a series of intimidating Huastec statues in sentry-like rows.
The layout of material is by regions, which only partly correspond to the
major cultural entities (Olmec, Maya, Aztec etc.) and cuts across both media
and periods. No system is perfect but this is a half-way measure which fully
serves neither an archaeological nor an artistic end.
The handsome catalogue is itself no small design achievement whose superb
illustrations provide much food for further thought and admiration. Alas the
text - a direct translation of the Spanish version - is rather idiosyncratic
in its selection of themes and suffers from the user-unfriendly focus of
academics. The short bibliography ignores most of the major English-language
studies.
The gold which fuelled the Conquistadores ravages is conspicuoulsy absent
from The Art of Mexico. This is only partly the result of the mindless orgy
in which the finest handiwork of the American goldsmiths was consigned
wholesale to the melting pot by the Spanish invaders. Unlike their South
American contemporaries, the Classic and earlier cultures of Mesoamerica did
not much value the yellow metal, importing it from the south only sparingly.
The Hayward show rightly avoids any hint of gold lust, focusing instead on
the myriad other artictic achievements of these most ill-fated of peoples.

<TEXT>     My gaze drifts aloft, to Venus.;    From Venus comes the only bit of good
news we have received all week. (It is not precisely clear to me why we are
able to know when somebody moves a crate of apricots across a gorge on Venus,
but we pretty much throw up our hands over whether Iraq has jets backed up
bumper to bumper on the inbound Hammurabi Expressway.);    Anyway, NASA has
come up with the news that there are spider-shaped volcanic bulges on Venus
(which, for a planet named after the goddess of love, turns out to have the
kind of big-time cellulite problems we would be more apt to associate with a
planet named after, say, Marge Schott).;    I have traditionally been a
detractor of NASA because (a) it's in my nature, generally, to detract; I
can't help that, and (b) I believe NASA has not come up with very much for the
commonweal except for the occasional polymer-coated technological marvel, such
as John Glenn.;    In this instance, however, I believe the NASA people are
onto something. They theorize that these spider-shaped bulges were formed when
huge blobs of molten rock inside Venus rose upward, creating fissures, bulges,
volcanic dikes and lava flows.;    Scientists now think the surface of Venus
is shaped by what they call (no kidding) "blob tectonics," the process by
which enormous giblets of molten rock drift upward toward the surface. On
Earth, this process resulted in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands as well
as Morton Downey Jr. (Well, nobody's that grown up.);    The idea that Venus
is seething with hot molten rock is a fairly new one because Venus is covered
with thick clouds. In 1918, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius theorized that
Venus must be covered with seas, swamps and steamy jungles, which might well
be inhabited by primeval monsters. Because of all the clouds, you see.
Arrhenius won a Nobel Prize. Boy, they were handing them out like Mylanta
tablets back then.;    When this war is over, let's face it, an oil change is
going to cost about the same as filling your crankcase with morel mushrooms.
So we need a new source of energy, and blob tectonics could be the answer.;   
Why couldn't we heat our homes and power our turbines with all that nice hot
magma sloshing around up on Venus?;    Because, you say, it's on Venus.;   
That is the difference between you, a moiling scullion in the common ruck, and
me, a lofty visionary.;    Here is my scheme: We install the
Inter-Solar-System Venus-to-Earth Molten-Rock Pipeline. (Faithful readers of
this column may wish to leaf back a few years in their carefully maintained
laminated loose-leaf binders and marvel at the resemblance of this plan to my
previous Alaskan Ice Cream Roll Pipeline).;    We run this pipeline (some kind
of heat-proof, flexible tubing -- get the guys who did the McDLT box right on
it) down from Venus to, let's say, Hamilton, Ohio.;    I realize it's going to
obstruct the view a little, but what's there to look at in Hamilton, Ohio?
Anyway, President Gephardt (it's inevitable, now) isn't going to stick it in
Missouri, is he? Plus, you'll get tourists.;    We're moving fast here, I
realize, but is everyone still with me? We get the hot rock from Venus. Who's
going to kick about it? They got no Sierra Club up there. Once we set up the
pipeline, it's easier than pumping oil because it's all downhill, right?;   
So all I've done is figured out a way for us to get free energy, pay off the
national debt and thumb our noses at the rest of the world. (It's the American
way.);    Now try to keep things running smoothly for a while. It's too much
trouble for me to be getting sick all the time.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 18/4/1994 -- In the presence of 
Jean Paul-Carteron, president of the Forum Foundation, of the 
Romanian Government's secretary-general and secretary-general of 
the Crans Montana Conference in Bucharest Viorel Hrebenciuc and 
numerous mass media representatives the press centre was 
inaugurated on 18 April of the Crans Montana Forum due in 
Bucharest over 21-24 April. Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Simona 
Miculescu will be spokeswoman also of the centre. 
  The press centre will issue every morning a document in 
Romanian, English and French with details of the day's schedule. 
It will also issue daily press releases in Romanian, French and 
English referring to the debates in plenum and in the sections 
on themes. They will comprise syntheses of the participants' 
addresses. Journalists will also receive Romanian and foreign 
press reviews, home and foreign news supplied by the ROMPRES 
national news agency, the texts of the statements and addresses 
of the previous day's speakers, other publications. The 
spokesperson will meet the journalists daily at 1300 hours [1000 
GMT]. Journalists that want to contact various personalities 
will apply directly to the office set up to this end under the 
conference's secretariat general. The press office will 
function daily between 0800 hours [0500 GMT] and 2000 [1700 
GMT]. It will accommodate also offices of the national radio, 
television and of ROMPRES. The documents issued by the press 
centre will not be official. 
  So far, the following heads of state have confirmed their 
participation in the Crans-Montana Forum: of Cyprus, Belarus, 
Estonia, Yugoslavia, Lithuania and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. All in all there will be 1,100 participants and 
700 journalists. Mme. Catherine Lalumiere will be present on 
the presidium at the inaugural session. Participating will also 
be nine prime ministers and deputy prime ministers, five 
parliament presidents and speakers, 12 foreign ministers and 
deputy foreign ministers, 20 ministers, 17 ambassadors, 12 
secretaries-general and assistant secretaries-general of 
international organizations, 67 members of the diplomatic corps 
accredited in Bucharest, 129 other political personalities. 
  The meeting of the Crans Montana Forum, a world-scale event, 
is going to take place over April 21-24 in Bucharest at the 
Parliament Palace, one of the world's largest buildings. 
  With a surface of 508,000 square meters, Romania's 
Parliament 
Palace is mentioned by the Guiness book of records as the second 
largest administrative building in the world, next to the 
Pentagon in Washington with a total surface of 604,000 square 
meters. 
  In point of the constructed volume, the palace is world's 
third with 2,550,000 square meters, next to a sky-rockets 
assembling building in Cape Canevral, Florida, with 3,666,000 
square meters and Quetzalcoatl Pyramid at Cholula, Mexico, with 
3,300,000 square meters, but ahead of the Keops pyramid ranked 
fourth with 2,500,000 square meters. 
  The construction works started on June 25, 1984, and 
swallowed about 480,000 cubic meters of high-quality cement, 
65,000 tonnes of steel for reinforced concrete, 42,000 tonnes of 
rolled steel. 
  The palace is furnished with a 286,000 square meter green 
backyard. 
  The building is the outcome of a great national effort, 
starting from its design and erection and ending with the 
materials suppliers, everything is Romanian. About 17,000 
people have worked on the building site. 
  Along with numerous main and secondary offices, reception 
rooms, meeting rooms, a plenary sitting room of the Chamber of 
Deputies, the Parliament's Palace has also a set of halls, rooms 
and lobbies impressing through astonishing elegance, size, 
furnishings and design, bearing names such as the main hall, the 
honorary gallery, the hall of the provinces, the union hall, the 
lobby of the union hall, the human rights hall.

<TEXT>
   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of
Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society.''
   The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the second century A.D., which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' Winfield said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the Yucatan
Peninsula, more than 700 miles to the east, Winfield said at the
museum in Xalapa, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in
their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars,
equivalent to May 22, 143 (A.D.), and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' Winfield
said.
   If the mysterious people did exist, Winfield said, they also
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who
emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the
artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one
century later.
   ``They could be the Xicalancas, of which Clavijero briefly
talked about,'' Winfield said, referring to the Rev. Francisco
Javier Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787), a Jesuit priest who
was the first to systematically study Mexico's ancient languages
and peoples.
   In his ``History of Ancient Mexico,'' Clavijero in three lines
briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the
Olmecs, but did not go into details.
   In ``nahuatl,'' the trading language of the Aztecs, who came
much later, Xicalanca means ``the people who live by the Great Body
of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of Mexico was called.
   The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in
the village of La Mojarra, where the Piojo River meets the Acula
River. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be
reached only by boat, Winfield said.
   La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the Acula
about 20 miles south of the port of Alvarado in Veracruz state. But
neither the village nor the Piojo River can be found on any map of
Mexico.
   Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of
basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length
profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering.
   ``He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest
_ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region
in ancient times,'' Winfield said.
   The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four
representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight
feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic.
   A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat
rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 ``elements'' like the
rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab.
   ``It was all carved during one continuous period,'' Winfield
said. ``It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient Mexico.''
   About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded
top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the Acula, just
outside La Mojarra.
   Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of
villagers.
   Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but Winfield said he kept
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed ``without the
pressure that such a discovery creates.''
   The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the
region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one
of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the
museum, is so badly damaged it cannot be studied, Winfield said.
   In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing.
   That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf
cultures. The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the
Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of
fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers.
   A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces
in a cardboard box.
   ``We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let
the museum have it,'' Winfield said.
   Winfield suspects the La Mojarra area could have been a
ceremonial site.
   ``If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be
found,'' he said.

   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of
Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society.''
   The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the second century A.D., which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' Winfield said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the Yucatan
Peninsula, more than 700 miles to the east, Winfield said at the
museum in Xalapa, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in

FT  04 AUG 92 / Arts: Wisdom of the Aztecs, writ in blood - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WISDOM of the Aztecs was enshrined in a painted literature. As the
conquistadors observed, the great Aztec ruler Moctezuma had libraries full
of painted books and scrolls, the work of priest-scribes who 'wrote' in
colourful images rather like strip-cartoons. Human blood was dripped on to
the pages to feed the images.
The exhibition Mexican Painted Books: Before and After the Conquest, at the
British Museum in London, offers a rare opportunity to see these most vivid
survivals of a vanished civilisation. But it does not make much of a fist at
explaining the complexity of what 'reading' meant to the ancient Mexicans.
The American peoples were analphabetic. Essentially, the Aztecs and their
neighbours used pictograms and ideograms, although by the 16th century they
were beginning to evolve phonetic symbols. Page layout, the scale of
symbols, the way they are grouped, even colour values: all influenced
meaning. Decoding a book, as the Europeans commented, was a dual process,
the eye scanning the images which prompted the reader to recite oral
history.
Britain's museums and libraries own a remarkable collection of ancient
Mexican manuscripts, the large part of which can now be seen in the
exhibition. The earliest codexes to appeal to English bibliophiles reached
Oxford's Bodleian Library in the early 17th century
The magnificent Codex Mendoza was illustrated by native artists on the
orders of the Spanish ambassador, to show Emperor Charles V what his new
subjects were like. However, it never reached him - the galleon taking it to
Spain was intercepted by a French man-of-war. Bought by Richard Hakluyt, the
English ambassador to France, it ended up in the Bodleian Library at Oxford
University. Libraries at Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow have also loaned
books, maps and scrolls.
Perhaps inevitably, one's first impression of this show is one of gloom.
Ancient Mexican books are fragile so light levels have to be kept low: even
scholars normally have to make do with facsimiles.
Mexican books were written on animal-skins coated with gesso, or on native
paper made from the beaten inner bark of trees of the Moraceae family, such
as figs and mulberries. Paper (amatl to the Aztecs) was also used to costume
the statues of the Aztec gods and in burnt offerings.
Quite the most remarkable things in the exhibition are the elaborate
pre-Hispanic screenfold books, long accordions of painted animal-skins which
could be read on both sides. In Codex Egerton, a Mixtec genealogy, we see 26
generations of rulers, symbolised by husbands and wives seated on thrones
and passing mysterious presents to each other.
The Fejervary, Zouche and Laud skin-fold books are splendid, but baffling.
Zouche was one of the manuscripts which Cortes sent to Charles V. One side
(it will be turned during the show) relates the bloodthirsty career of the
hero Eight Deer. On the other side, there is a genealogy focused on
generations of goddesses all called Three Flints.
In the brilliantly coloured scenes in the Fejervary codex - red, turquoise,
and pale yellow within heavy black outlines - there are such ominous images
that the human sacrifices of the Aztecs come readily to mind. Gods hold
small figures by ropes around their necks. Severed heads are perched on
stools and a jaguar-headed god holds a human head between its jaws.
Figuratively speaking, these pages are spattered with the blood of
codicologists struggling to interpret them.
Post-Conquest books are, on the whole, easier to follow as native artists
painted for their foreign masters, and became progressively influenced by
the woodcuts in European books. Opportunely, there is a new book on this
topic: Serge Gruzinski's Painting the Conquest: The Mexican Indians and the
European Renaissance (Unesco/Flammarion, 231 pages).
This would be my candidate for the most desirable of all the new books on
the Conquest. Written by a specialist, it is both a pleasure to read and
beautifully illustrated from post-Columbian codices, especially the
Florentine Codex; none of the pictures, oddly enough, are from the BM's
collection.
In the exhibition itself, the Kingsborough Codex provides a vivid picture of
the fabulous wealth of the new country and of the cruel exactions of the
conquerors. Indians are grabbed by the hair to force them to disgorge for
the annual sailing of the tribute-ships for Spain, laden not only with gold,
'the divine excrement', but with furs, obsidian, shoes, pottery jars, and
brilliantly-coloured mantles and cloth.
In one scene, Cortes himself appears, ordering four reluctant tribute-payers
to be burnt alive. Remarkably, one such Aztec tribute-list now on view was
unearthed as recently as 1986 in the Ulster Museum. A charming little
treatise of the mid-17th Century shows the manufacture of cochineal, a red
dye made from crushed beetles, which remained for centuries an important
export.
As for Christianity, arguably Spain's greatest export to Mexico, it is
represented by an 18th century illustrated example of the popular Doctrina
Christiana. Here we see the radical disjunction between word and image which
initially was so foreign to the Indians. The woodcut shows Adam and Eve
expelled from the Garden of Eden. Was this a particularly poignant image to
these recent converts? The text is in Nahuatl, written in Roman script.
The BM's Aubin Codex, a history of the Aztec from 1168 to 1608, just might
jog visitors' memories. Aubin was a 19th century French ethnographer who
also gave his name to a pre-Hispanic codex of horoscopes which in 1841, was
presented to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. And then, ten years ago
this summer, a Mexican journalist 'liberated' it from its wooden box. By the
time the library authorities had noticed its loss, the book was in Mexico's
National Museum of Anthropology. Jacques Lang, French Minister of Culture,
objected, but nothing doing. The Mexicans are sticking to their precious
specimen of reverse plunder.
The exhibition runs until next spring.

VERACRUZ, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The only madhouse with a sea view." That's how one Jarocho, as locals here are 
known, characterizes this city. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the boisterous street life of this bustling port on the Gulf of Mexico 
frequently verges on the insane. Veracruz's zocalo has a reputation, in fact, 
as Mexico's liveliest central square. 
</P>
<P>
And at this time of the year things get even livelier. The week before Lent 
brings the annual carnaval, and to understand it, a visitor first must 
understand what passes for normal in Veracruz, especially around the white 
colonnaded zocalo. 
</P>
<P>
In sidewalk bars, white-shirted waiters pile bottles of beer precariously on 
tables already overloaded with empties. Mariachi bands serenade the crowd, 
while strolling trumpeters, harpists and marimba players in silver-trimmed 
uniforms and oversized sombreros offer song lists to prospective customers. A 
white-faced mime, or perhaps a troupe of lavishly costumed dancers, performs 
for an audience gathered around the central fountain. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a moving market threads its way between the cafe tables. 
Vendors offer goods of all kinds -- silk hammocks and pistachios, cigarettes 
and embroidered dresses, preposterous model ships several feet long and 
elaborately rigged, even Polaroid snapshots to commemorate your evening in 
Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
This is everyday Veracruz. But the city really comes into its own during the 
weeklong carnival, when it plays host to one of the biggest fiestas between New 
Orleans and Rio de Janeiro. This year it is set for Feb. 20-28. 
</P>
<P>
All work comes to a halt during the carnival, and everyone -- visitor and 
native alike -- gets down to the serious business of having fun. Each day the 
streets are filled with colorful parades that begin in mid-afternoon, when 
revelers have recovered from the festivities of the night before, and last into 
the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age beauty queens wave from atop outlandish floats (a giant fish on 
wheels, for instance), uniformed bands march endlessly, and neighborhood 
musicians play odd instruments that have no names in English. 
</P>
<P>
Squalls of confetti fill the air. Salsa, rumba, tango, calypso -- all the music 
of the Caribbean dances its way past the crowds watching from street level or 
from balconies. Many people sport elaborate costumes -- some older folks, for 
example, dress in the fashions of their youth, while others parade about 
disguised as the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl or perhaps as Batman. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival has always carried an undertone of social and political satire 
amid the festivity. This has not always set well with the authorities, but 
attempts by government to tone down the exuberance have invariably failed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as in years past, the first of more than 40 floats will celebrate 
the ritual burning of Bad Humor, a larger-than-life, papier-mache character 
dressed in black and scowling. In previous carnivals, Bad Humor has lampooned 
corrupt politicians or police officials. This year former Panamanian dictator 
Manuel Noriega is one candidate for the role; another is President Bush. 
Jarochos like to poke fun through their choice and at the same time make a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the carnival there is the symbolic funeral of Juan Carnaval, 
not a papier-mache caricature this time but a real person who wanders about the 
city surrounded by grieving women draped in mourning attire. Juan will, of 
course, be reborn the following year. 
</P>
<P>
In between the burning of Bad Humor and the mock funeral of Juan Carnaval, the 
city throws what is virtually a nonstop party. All-night dances fill the 
plazas. Fireworks erupt almost continuously. The spirit is intoxicating, and 
those who begin as spectators usually end up as participants. 
</P>
<P>
Veracruz's light-hearted approach to life may well be a result of its turbulent 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1519, Hernando Cortes and his army of Spanish Conquistadors landed at the 
tiny island of San Juan de Ulua in Veracruz harbor. They negotiated with envoys 
of the Aztec emperor Montezuma, set up a shrine to the Virgin Mary and founded 
the first Spanish town in the Americas. They optimistically named it Villa Rica 
de la Vera Cruz -- the Rich Town of the True Cross. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan de Ulua and the harbor were vital in the country's trade and defense. 
In the 16th Century the port was repeatedly attacked by pirates, and after such 
infamous marauders as John Hawkins and Francis Drake successfully plundered 
Veracruz, the authorities of New Spain fortified the island. Even so, during a 
17th-Century raid the soldiers stationed at the fort deserted their posts 
because they hadn't been paid, and the town succumbed to Dutch buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Today the "island" of San Juan is connected by a highway to the mainland and is 
home port to naval ships and enormous industrial tankers, signs of Veracruz's 
latter-day development as the largest city and busiest port in the oil-rich 
state of Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-minute bus ride from the town center, the old fort, in contrast to the 
concrete jungle of the shipyards, looks like a kindergartner's idea of a 
castle, complete with moat, drawbridge and dungeons. Its wind-swept balustrades 
look out over the Gulf of Mexico. Deep inside are dank, rough-hewn dungeons 
known as Glory, Purgatory and Hell. It is hard to believe that any of them were 
anything but hellish. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries after the last pirate attack the harbor continued to play a role in 
Mexico's defense. During the War of Independence, San Juan's fort was the final 
stronghold of the Spanish, who were expelled by anti-colonial forces after a 
long and bloody battle in 1825. In the so-called Pastry War of 1838, the French 
invaded Veracruz, claiming that the Mexican government owed them money for 
damaged property. The supposedly impregnable fort of San Juan capitulated 
readily to France's superior firepower. But the French later were persuaded to 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also invaded Mexico, twice using Veracruz as the starting 
point. During the Mexican-American War in 1847, Gen. Winfield Scott attacked 
Veracruz, leading troops hurriedly through the town on the way to Mexico City 
to avoid the perennial yellow fever that plagued the coastal area. 
</P>
<P>
During the Mexican Revolution, Woodrow Wilson sent the U.S. fleet to subdue 
Veracruz and hence protect the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
To honor the town's resistance to those four foreign invasions, Veracruz 
officially proclaims itself "four times heroic." 
</P>
<P>
The Museo Cultural de la Ciudad, Veracruz's city museum on Avenida Zaragoza 
between Calle Canal and Calle Morales, celebrates these feats. It also offers 
intriguing details on the town's history, such as the number of times it burned 
down during the 17th Century (four, aided by fierce northerly winds) and major 
goods that once passed through the port (such as hand grenades, silk and olive 
oil from Spain, and chile, cocoa, tobacco and gold from the colony). 
</P>
<P>
Frequent epidemics during the 17th and 18th centuries, due to its humid 
tropical climate and mosquito-infested jungles, earned Veracruz the nicknames 
"Port of Hell" and "Graveyard of the Living." 
</P>
<P>
Early Spanish settlers hurried inland to more civilized regions. Left behind in 
Veracruz were sailors, merchants, Caribbean and African slaves, and random 
wanderers just looking for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this multicultural blend of starry-eyed adventurers and sturdy vagabonds 
emerged the Jarocho, or Veracruz native. Jarocho culture is reckless, 
irreverent, insubordinate, and has produced some memorable political escapades. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th Century, for example, an Angolan slave named Yanga -- who was 
either a bandit or liberator of the oppressed, depending on whom you talk to -- 
led the first slave revolt in the New World. In this century vociferous 
Veracruz prostitutes ignited a tenants' rebellion that helped precipitate a 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Jarochos are more laid-back than revolutionary; they talk slowly, dress 
casually, and excel in music and dance. Music is inescapable. In the zocalo 
alone, you hear four or five varieties at once on almost any evening throughout 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Those visitors inspired to try swinging to the Latin beat should head for La 
Bamba, a waterfront club named after the world-famous dance that supposedly 
originated in Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
At a little bar called La Bella Epoca, two blocks southwest of the zocalo on a 
pedestrian alleyway, a band of funky old men play guitars, drums and percussive 
gourds in the home-grown style of "sol" -- not soul, but sun -- which began in 
the 1940s. The bar's regulars, who look old enough to know, claim that the same 
individuals who play today were among the founders of this syncopated, eclectic 
musical style. 
</P>
<P>
Jarochos are fond of music and equally fond of good food, particularly seafood, 
which is fresh and inexpensive here. The best seafood restaurants are in the 
village of Boca del Rio, on the Rio Jamapa about five miles south of Veracruz. 
There the restaurant most often recommended is Pardino's, which is a little 
more upscale than the rest, serving such dishes as octopus or sea bass with 
Veracruzana sauce -- a delicious mixture of onion, garlic, tomatoes, olives, 
green pepper and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
A good place in Veracruz to try some traditional Mexican favorites, meanwhile, 
is Restaurant Tlaquepaque, three blocks from the zocalo. There, combinations of 
marinated meats and fresh vegetables on tortillas can be enjoyed for less than 
$5 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are no problem in Veracruz, either, except during the carnival. 
The city has an enormous range of hotels, all of which are reasonably priced by 
U.S. standards. For a visit during carnival time, reservations must be made 
months ahead. A few rooms are available for this year's event, but only in the 
budget hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The most luxurious hotel on the zocalo is the Hotel Veracruz, where lovely 
air-conditioned rooms cost about $75 a night. Those who prefer a beach-side 
setting would do well to check out the architecturally splendid Hotel Mocambo, 
a few miles south of town at Playa Mocambo. The Hotel Mocambo has an outdoor 
pool set among spacious patios. Rooms are about $60 a night. More lavish and 
more expensive resorts share the same stretch of coast, where the dark-sand 
beaches are the best in the area. 
</P>
<P>
For the more budget-minded traveler, several hotels near the zocalo -- such as 
the Hotel Imperial, the Concha Dorado and the Hotel Rex -- make up in charm 
what they lack in luxury, offering reasonable accommodations for less than $15 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
How to get there: Veracruz is easily reached from Mexico City. Mexicana offers 
40-minute flights from the capital twice a day. First-class ADO buses take 
about six hours, and leave hourly. There are no direct flights to Veracruz from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

Hotel Veracruz. Avenida Independencia at Calle Lerdo. $65. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Mocambo. Carretera Veracruz-Mocambo, in Mocambo. $60.

As Hernan Cortes' small army neared the Aztecan capital of Tenochtitlan in 
1519, they arrived at Iztapalapa, a hilltop village that gave the Spaniards 
their first panoramic view of the sprawling New World metropolis in the valley 
of Mexico. Cortes and his men numbered only 400. The city was the seat of the 
expansive Aztec empire, and had a population of a half million. 
</P>
<P>
As one chronicler in Cortes' band described it, "We saw so many cities and 
villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land . . . we were 
amazed and said that it was like the enchantments they tell of in the legend of 
Amadis, on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the 
water . . . And some of our soldiers asked whether the things that we saw were 
not a dream . . . all was cemented and very splendid with many kinds of stone 
monuments with pictures on them, which gave much to think about." 
</P>
<P>
It is in such moments of confounded awe -- on the eve of great destruction -- 
that Mexican art, as we know it, had its ambiguous birth. For finally, the 
conquest of Mexico was as much a triumph of the eye as it was a victory of the 
sword and gun. 
</P>
<P>
For many years to come, the conquistadores' way of seeing the world would be 
the only true one, and they quickly set about remaking much of the fantastic, 
alien world they encountered in their own image, as a "New Spain." 
</P>
<P>
The chronicler, writing 30 years after the events, concludes his account of the 
dazzling first sight of Tenochtitlan by noting that, "Of all these wonders that 
I then beheld today all is overthrown and lost, nothing left standing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 471 years later, at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
preparations are nearly complete for a new Mexican conquest. Opening Oct. 10 is 
"Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries," the most significant exhibition of art 
from Mexico to appear in New York in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
From New York City, the nearly 400 objects in the show will later travel 
exclusively to the two Chicano capitals of Mexamerica, appearing first at the 
San Antonio Museum of Art (April 6-Aug. 4, 1991), and then at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art (Sept. 29-Dec. 29, 1991). For Los Angeles, it will be the 
most important public presentation of Mexican art since the 1978 "Treasures of 
Mexico" show, sponsored by the Armand Hammer Foundation at the County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted "Twenty Centuries of 
Mexican Art," the first major exhibition of its kind to be shown in the United 
States (see accompanying story). And in 1970, the Metropolitan Museum hosted 
"Before Cortes," an historic show of the pre-Columbian sculpture of 
Mesoamerica. 
</P>
<P>
But the Met show is perhaps the most comprehensive collection of ancient, 
colonial and modern Mexican artistry ever assembled in the United States. In 
scale, it is the largest show the museum has presented since "The Vatican 
Collection: The Papacy and Art" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, designers, lighting engineers, and workmen at the Metropolitan 
Museum are finishing the specially constructed, maze-like exhibition gallery as 
some of the pieces are being installed. 
</P>
<P>
According to the show's four co-curators, all members of the museum staff, 
featured works include Mayan and Aztecan sculptures, early post-conquest 
manuscripts, popular religious and devotional objects, costumes, graphics, and 
paintings, ranging in date of origin from 1000 BC to AD 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Amassing such an enormous grouping of objects is a logistics triumph that has 
been three years in the making, with pieces drawn from 41 public and 24 private 
collections in Mexico, the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The principal financial supporter of the multi-million dollar event is a newly 
formed, Los Angeles-based foundation, "Friends of the Arts of Mexico," which in 
turn is the brainchild of Emilio Azcarraga, the chairman of Mexico's Televisa 
network. In 1987, Azcarraga approached Philippe de Montebello, director of the 
Metropolitan Museum, with the idea for a comprehensive show of Mexican art. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" is its most high-profile 
undertaking to date, the organization -- which has a mandate to promote 
appreciation of Mexico's artistic and cultural heritage in this country -- has 
already sponsored a touring exhibition of work by young Mexican artists, as 
well as efforts to preserve the Rock Art of Baja California and the David 
Alfaro Siquieros "America Tropical" mural on Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
John McDonald, exhibition coordinator of the Metropolitan show, and curator for 
the 19th-Century section, modestly sums up the collection that has been 
gathered for the October opening in New York City as "more than a roundup of 
the usual suspects." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do a comprehensive exhibition. With 50 years since the last major 
show, it was long enough for people to forget, for generations to come and go 
and not have a chance to see this work. It will be an eye-opener for a New York 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
As befits an imperial exhibition of this sort, the scope of cultural periods 
and styles to be represented in the show is impressive, offering the North 
American public a rare opportunity to see under one roof a spectrum of Mexican 
artistic expression that would be difficult to match in weeks of museum touring 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the pre-Hispanic section, which will comprise one-third of the 
exhibition, will be one of the colossal stone heads of the Olmec people, who 
came before the more familiar Mayan and Aztecan civilizations. The giant heads, 
discovered in La Venta and San Lorenzo, Tabasco on the Gulf Coast beginning in 
the 1920s, depict faces that appear distinctly Negroid and have caused many to 
speculate on the possibility of ancient contact between the peoples of 
Mesoamerica and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
From the ancient Mayan city of Palenque, there will be an exquisitely 
naturalistic sculptured stucco head with an unforgettable penetrating, yet 
tranquil gaze. Julie Jones, curator for this section of the exhibition, 
explains that recent breakthroughs in cracking the Mayan hieroglyphic language 
allow us to now identify this figure as the king Pacal II, who ruled Palenque 
during during its 7th-Century heyday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jones, the pre-Columbian portion of the show will not just be "the 
son of 'Before Cortes,' " -- the Metropolitan's 1970 show -- but will reflect 
the expansion of knowledge related to the ancient cultures of Mexico that has 
taken place over the last 50 years, with such "meaningful digging" as the 1978 
excavation of the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The cultures of civilizations before the conquest will be further explored 
through artifacts of the great cities of Izapa, Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, 
Palenque, El Tajin, Chichen Itza and Tenochtitlan. 
</P>
<P>
With the mixing of Spanish and indigenous blood after the conquest, Mexican art 
begins to reflect the mastery and subtle transformation of European artistic 
styles, along with an abiding rootedness in the ritual power and visual drama 
of the Pre-Hispanic cultures. A good deal of the rest of the show will 
illustrate this extraordinary tension which is the veritable reactor core of 
the Mexican tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than finding continuity," observes Johanna Hecht, curator for the 
Colonial -- or Viceregal -- element of the collection, "I would say there is a 
kind of attitude or historical sensibility that carries through. Aztecs 
attempted to identify with the Toltecs. And the criollos and mestizos come to 
do the same with the Aztecs." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to advance criticism of her section by some art critics, Hecht 
insists she is not presenting "conquistador art." Indeed, there will be an 
anonymous miniature folk sculpture of St. James the Moor Killer, ironically 
depicted as a conquistador. Also, Jose de Alcibar's somber 1777 religious 
portrait of the newly ordained 22-year-old nun Sor Maria Ignacia de la Sangre, 
which out-Baroques the Spanish master Velazquez with a dizzying excess of 
floral ornamentation and fetishized Christian iconography that comes close to 
being neo-Aztecan kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
A stunning 16th-Century mosaic image of the Virgen de Guadalupe in the show 
stands six feet high and is executed entirely in mother-of-pearl inlay on wood, 
in a frame adorned with cracked shells. This artisanal object exudes a primal 
aura that resonates with the presence of the Madonna's Indian alter-image, 
Tonantzin, the Aztecan goddess who had been worshipped, before the Spanish 
</P>
<P>
came, on the hill where Juan Diego had his visions of the Virgen. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, because of lending restrictions, this mosaic is among several objects 
that will only appear in the Metropolitan Museum's installation of the show, 
depriving Los Angeles and San Antonio of potentially one of the most popular 
objects in the assembled collection. (This omission may yet lead to the first 
time someone comes to the Metropolitan Museum on a sacred pilgrimage -- a 
number of years ago, a replica from Mexico of the Virgen de San Juan de los 
Lagos attracted thousands of San Antonio worshipers to a barrio chapel to view 
and pray to the small figure.) 
</P>
<P>
With the works to be shown in the 19th- and 20th-Century sections of the 
exhibition, another current of the complex Mexican psyche will be evident. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellion and the struggle for independence are now almost genetically 
ingrained in the Mexican national consciousness. For many artists, this has 
provoked passionate efforts to transcend the Eurocentric vision of the 
conquistador that marked modern Mexico's beginning and achieve a completely 
native aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan show promises an array of explosive self-portraits that 
testify to this inner struggle among Mexican artists. From the smoldering stare 
of Hermenegildo Bustos painted in 1891, to the exotic personal mythology of 
Frida Kahlo's "Self Portrait With Monkeys," and the fiery iconoclasm of 
muralist David Alfaro Siquieros' self-portrait, where, with outstretched arm in 
front of him, the artist appears to be tearing at the canvas, attempting to 
escape, or perhaps, to pull the viewer in. All of these paintings, and other 
work by masters such as Jose Maria Velasco, Jose Guadalupe Posada, Diego Rivera 
and the major muralists, and Rufino Tamayo, testify to the crucible of 
self-exploration that has been the forge of revolutionary change in Mexico for 
the last two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the museum and foundation literature describing the monumental show 
emphasizes the theme of the Mexican tradition's grandeur and continuity, 
offering the images and objects of the massive exhibition as a collective 
symbol of modern Mexico's rich cultural patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has one of the most ancient, continuous, and important artistic 
heritages of any region of the Americas," observes museum director Philippe de 
Montebello in one exhibition press release. "As our neighbor and friend it 
should be better known to us." 
</P>
<P>
The show itself will essentially be organized around the history, and 
prehistory, of the modern Mexican state. With one-third of the exhibits devoted 
to the pre-Columbian civilizations, and another third devoted to the colonial 
period, the remaining work will represent the Independence and Revolutionary 
periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively. The latest work dates 
from 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, from Mayan stelae to Diego Rivera, the assemblage approximates a 
family history of what Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- in 
another piece of exhibition literature -- calls "La identidad nacional" (The 
national identity). The President's office, along with the Ministry of Tourism, 
has gotten into the act with a festival of events, "Mexico: A Work of Art," 
adding yet another level of public relations patina to the Metropolitan show. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the new exhibition's rather safe conceptual scheme mimics the 
general outline of the 1940 MOMA show, as well as the 1978 exhibition at LACMA. 
Consequently, important recent experiences in Mexico's history, from the demise 
of the idealism of the muralists, to the 1968 student massacre at Tlateloco, 
crippling international debt, and the devastating Mexico City earthquake, will 
go unnoted. And we will have to wait for the next major Mexico show to hope for 
a more thematically reflective and syncretic approach to the profound questions 
Mexico's traditions present. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the omission of contemporary work, exhibition coordinator McDonald 
explains, "If we had tried to do it justice, we would've had to nibble back on 
other sections -- or break up the show with a staircase to another floor." (The 
exhibit also contains no folk art, which was included in the 1940 MOMA show.) 
</P>
<P>
While this artistic Circus Maximus of things Mexican is likely to win a new 
host of aficionados in New York City, it will be interesting to follow the 
Metropolitan show's impact in San Antonio and Los Angeles, where the rich array 
of objects and images may yet rekindle some of the nationalist artistic 
sentiment that marked so much Chicano art of the Movimiento period through the 
'60s and '70s. At a time when young Mexican Americans are exploring new 
expressions of their own "root aesthetic" in rap, performance art, and film, 
such exposure could add heat and light to their mounting critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shortcomings or exaggerations may exist in the show's interstices, the 
exhibits, along with a season of related lectures and films, will compose a 
not-to-be-missed tableau of the ages of a nation. Of course, there would seem 
to be limits to what can be shipped and seen in this country. "You can't 
transport Teotihuacan or Monte Alban or a baroque church," muses McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" we are likely to glimpse the 
deeper streams of Mexican identity, too often overlooked in media coverage of 
the country's Byzantine political system, its poverty- and debt-burdened 
economy, and the perennial concern with the flow of undocumented workers across 
the U.S. border.

It takes quite a mental leap to enter the world of ancient Mesoamerica from our 
contemporary, urban cocoon. The shift in sensibilities is dramatic and may even 
evoke some surprising jealousies if one contrasts today's techno-efficient 
mind-set with the sturdy spiritual and aesthetic scaffolding that framed 
Mesoamerican culture. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty and integrity of the work in the Mingei International Museum's 
current show, "Precolumbian Flora and Fauna: Continuity of Plant and Animal 
Themes in Mesoamerican Art," help make that mental leap inviting. Once 
transported, the ingenuity of form and depth of belief so abundant in the show 
can both nourish and instruct the mindful viewer. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit (through Feb. 17) does more than offer a rich survey of painted, 
carved and modeled animal and plant forms from present-day Mexico and its 
southern neighbors. It reminds us of what we have lost and may never recapture: 
a cycle of respect among the species, an interdependence that ensures mutual 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
The Mingei show focuses on the continuity of certain motifs and belief systems 
across Precolumbian cultures, but the work itself speaks more of distinction, 
of individuals' creativity, their endless, marvelous permutations on familiar 
forms and functional objects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the show and its well-illustrated catalogue are divided into four 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
The first three represent the three tiers of the Precolumbian cosmos -- air, 
earth and underworld -- and the final section presents contemporary examples of 
thematically related folk art from the Mesoamerica region. 
</P>
<P>
"Precolumbian man used animals to understand and order natural phenomena," 
explains guest curator Jeanette Favrot Peterson in her catalogue essay. 
</P>
<P>
"Ancient societies structured their world view using plant and animal 
metaphors; they endowed their deities with powers symbolized by fauna and 
flora; their ruling elite borrowed from nature those characteristics they 
wished to emulate and control." Hence, when a Mayan ruler wore a waterlily 
insignia, the flower's associations with agricultural canals and the watery 
underworld bestowed power to the ruler over fertility and the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Tight visual and conceptual links bound the earth to its occupants in 
Precolumbian culture, which spanned roughly 3,000 years, from about 1,500 B.C. 
up to the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. The crocodile, for example, was 
one of several fish-like creatures that came to symbolize the earthly realm, 
for it floated on water, just like land, resting atop the fluid underworld. 
Further, the patterns on the backs of crocodiles, turtles and toads were 
compared to the geometric patterns of tilled fields. And the snake's shedding 
of its skin each year came to represent the Earth's own seasonal renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitivity to the form, texture and behavior of animals ran high among the 
Olmec, Maya and Aztec cultures, and the candor and energy of the animal figures 
here bear witness to the artists' close observation as well as his belief in 
the animals' spiritual power. A clay monkey effigy (550-800 A.D.) with a 
sacrificial rope around its neck wears an expression of uncanny honesty, as if 
aware of the higher meaning bestowed upon his life and death as purveyor of 
creativity and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs, though domesticated, were also eaten and offered as sacrifices to the 
gods in ancient Mesoamerica, which comprised Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, 
most of Mexico and parts of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Most of the 
canine figures capture the animal's frisky, friendly nature, nuzzling into 
another's neck, gnawing on a bone, or squirming on its back, with legs poking 
up into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to depict essences of form and character overshadow any concern for 
detailed representation. Forms are often simplified and generalized. This 
paring down not only heightens the vitality of the forms but lends them 
integrity as abstract design, a fact not lost on such early 20th-Century 
modernists as Picasso and Braque. 
</P>
<P>
Form and function meld gracefully in vessels whose openings double as dog 
tails, or whose handles are formed by the arching body of a bird. In one Mayan 
vessel of buff clay, a cylindrical base incised with delicate patterns supports 
a horizontal fish. The vessel's opening, a large round hole in the creature's 
belly, echoes the shape of the fish's bulging eye and is subtly framed by the 
arch of its fins. 
</P>
<P>
The show concludes with a small selection of masks, vessels and ritual objects 
from contemporary Mexico and Central America. Native beliefs have persisted, 
despite the Spanish imposition of Christianity in the 16th Century, and the 
continuity of themes and motifs during Precolumbian times still holds today.

   Art in Service of Revolution

   San Francisco -- "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation,
1965-1985" began its three-year national tour at the Wight
Art Gallery at UCLA almost a year ago. After stops at Denver
and Albuquerque, it spent most of this summer (to Aug. 25) at
San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art. Next, these 130-plus
works by 90-plus artists will go to the Fresno Art Museum in
Fresno, Calif. (Sept. 21-Nov. 24); Tucson, Ariz.; the
National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C. (summer
1992); the Bronx Museum of the Arts in New York (spring
1993); and San Antonio, Texas.
   A Chicano manifesto of 1969 insisted that "we must ensure
that our writers, poets, musicians and artists produce
literature and art that is appealing to our people and
relates to our revolutionary cause." One essay in the
projected catalog virtually defies the non-Chicano critic to
understand what is going on here. The author claims that the
artists who have participated in "El Movimento" since 1965
have been and continue to be aggressively political, even
propagandistic, uninterested in such outdated
European-modernist concerns as "universality" or the supposed
intrinsic worth of unique works of art. "Someone who is not
an expert in the field may impose notions of quality that are
inappropriate to the work under consideration."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, I've been warned.
   Like many big touring art shows these days, this one tells
you what to think, every step of the way. We begin in a sort
of consciousness-raising chamber, in which world history has
been rewritten, on a series of large placards, from a
Chicanoactivist perspective.
   From this re-educational experience, we are led through a
series of eight thematic subsections ("La Causa," "Cultural
Icons," "Reclaiming the Past," "Feminist Visions," etc.). At
the entrance to each section, another placard informs us of
the importance of this particular aspect of the Chicanos'
struggle for justice and identity in the U.S., beginning with
the Delano farm-workers' strike of 1962, and its several
artistic offshoots -- notably poster art and Luis Valdez's El
Teatro Campesino. The show focuses on Aztlan, the
southwestern swath of the U.S. (roughly Texas through
California) ceded by Mexico in 1848. In 1969, some radical
utopians in El Movimento demanded that all this land -- which
they regarded as the historic homeland of the Aztecs -- be
given "back" to U.S. Chicanos, so they could use it to set up
an independent nation.
   Alongside about half the works on display, additional
placards tell us (a) what the artist intended, (b) how to
interpret the work, and (c) how we are to respond to it,
emotionally and politically. This is all very helpful, but I
tend to resist such directives and reconstruct exhibitions
according to more personal reactions.
   The three all-Chicano committees that oversaw the
selection process probably guaranteed that a great many
artists (including six committee members) would end up being
chosen. If the work of a few participants appears to rise
above the norm, it may be because it comes closest to meeting
those outdated, European-formalist standards. The vivid
silk-screen prints of Malaquias Montoya and Rupert Garcia
belong in any history of modern poster design. Carlos
Santistevan's "Holy Infant of Atocha," made out of old car
parts, fits an international modern sensibility, as does
Patssi Valdez's huge handcolored photo collage of "Downtown
Los Angeles," on loan from a private collection in Vienna.
   Some degree of identity confusion is likely among artists
and activists who speak Spanish and have Spanish names, but
tend to identify with the indigenous peoples the Spanish
colonized -- or, more confusing still, with a genetic mixture
of the two. They may derive emotional benefit from the
symbols and rituals of a religion many have rejected; feel no
profound connection to a "homeland" their families have only
recently left; seek a new identity in the flashy artifacts of
their current and unloved economic masters; and have to break
laws to get their paintings and signatures up on other
people's walls.
   Some of the most interesting art on display bears witness
to this cultural dissonance. I was struck by iconoclastic
works like Rudy Martinez's "A Juanderful Piece" and Teddy
Sandoval's "Chile Chaps," which mock half a dozen Anglo
stereotypes of Mexicans at once. Amalia Mesa -- Bains's
lavish mirrored vanity -- altar to Dolores del Rio (the pile
of dried rose petals at its base suffused a whole room with
its scent) was a far wittier statement than the humorless
label-writers seemed to realize -- as were a number of other
religion-twisting versions of Mexican altars or niches, laden
with "milagros", snapshots, toys, lace, death's heads and
dime-store junk. Larry Yanez's "Hey Zeus" placed a
Christ-in-Agony chromo inside a pear-crate frame adorned with
crude "turista" artifacts. David Avalos's fine blue "Donkey
Cart Altar" -- a protest against border-patrol brutality,
among other things -- combined a number of warring and bitter
ideas.
   The Virgin of Guadalupe, La Patrona de la Raza (whether
all the artists believed in her or not, the curators inform
us she did appear in 1531) is recycled into a number of
contemporary Chicano visions. Yolanda Lopez's versions of
herself, her mother, and her grandmother as the Virgin are
popular, powerful feminist illustrations. Rupert Garcia's "La
Virgen y Yo" (himself an agnostic black shape hanging upside
down, confronting the blurred sacred image) implies more by
saying less.
   A few artists -- notably wall muralists and poster makers
-- have been able to do powerful things with Aztec motifs,
ancient geometric patterns, heroic images of muscled
warrior-gods and serpentine monsters. More recent cultural
icons include the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo -- already
being transformed into a kind of suffering feminist saint --
and Mexican rebel heroes like Emiliano Zapata and Pancho
Villa.
   Some Chicano artists have tried to legendize the less
heroic "pachucos" and "cholos" -- members of urban street
gangs of the '40s and today -- along with their ritual
costumes and customized cars, their defiant girls and
graffiti. Luis Valdez pulled this off in his play (and film)
"Zoot Suit," and a few 1970s images of the scene are still
potent. But there seems something a little decadent today in
celebrating these (I quote the wall) "symbols of Chicano
cultural resistance and affirmation" without even the hint of
a question. A few Chicano "graffiti artists" have made the
leap from defacing buildings with flair and daring to a kind
of inspired calligraphy on canvas, sanctioned by gallery
shows. Careful social-realist images of barrio life, whether
photographed (Joe Ramos, Ricardo Valverde) or drawn (Santos
Martinez), can inform the uninformed by virtue of their
craft.
   Of specifically, univocally political art -- "Viva la
Huelga]" posters, border patrolmen as the devil -- the more
explicit the message, the less satisfying the art. The
complex ethics and politics of immigration and deportation
across the Rio Grande cannot be explained or resolved by
images of Mexican corpses impaled on the spikes of the Statue
of Liberty's crown.
   This is an exhibition of art on behalf of a
cultural-political cause, and (barring the pushy wall
placards) about as good as such an exhibit can be.
Traditional art collectors and gallery-goers in the U.S. seem
more than willing to go into liberal-aesthetic raptures over
the agitprop art of Russian revolutionaries, Picasso in his
Marxist mode, Polish poster-makers fighting their Soviet
masters -- all of them safely distant and past. Such people
might do well to expose themselves to many-layered, vibrant,
provocative art that reveals at least some of the faces of a
growing and justifiably angry portion of this country's
population.

AT THE GALLERIES: ARTIST NANCY KITTREDGE TAKES A PAGE FROM THE FAUVIST LEGACY

In the early years of this century, painters Henri Matisse and Maurice De 
Vlaminck launched a style that became known as Fauvism for its wild, autonomous 
color. The two artists also played the violin together, but at a certain point 
in their musical relationship, Matisse bowed out. Vlaminck, it seemed, insisted 
on playing fortissimo all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
This snippet of art history brings much to bear on the current show of Nancy 
Kittredge's work at the David Zapf Gallery (2400 Kettner Blvd.), through Oct. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Kittredge's use of hot, vivid color owe much to the Fauvist 
legacy, but, like Vlaminck's playing, Kittredge's painting shrieks with a high 
intensity that never lets up. Searing reds and shocking greens smother nearly 
every canvas, piling on the tension but offering no relief. 
</P>
<P>
Christian themes such as the fall of man and the offering of Communion appear, 
as do such religious symbols as crosses and fish. Many of the paintings and 
pastel drawings in the show can also be read in more universal terms, as images 
of individuals on personal journeys of enlightenment. Yet the passionate 
physicality of Kittredge's palette seems to be at odds with the cool 
spirituality of her images. 
</P>
<P>
In "Uncharted Course," two women in a boat float down a grass-lined canal, 
quiet and contemplative. In "The Blue Triangle," a pair of silhouetted figures 
stand in awe at a vision of the geometric form hovering in a luminous cloud. In 
her notes to the show, Kittredge points out that the blue triangle represents 
the Holy Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
Whether gazing at symbols in the sky or at each other, the figures in 
Kittredge's paintings are always statuesque and stoic, their expressions 
absently fixed in the middle distance. "I accept the fact that we live on two 
different spheres and that we are going on to something different and have been 
somewhere else," Kittredge is quoted as saying in the 1988 book, "San Diego 
Artists." Indeed, her characters do seem to exist in an amorphous space between 
realms, pondering the spiritual threshold before them. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, however, this quiet narrative is clothed in an ill-fitting costume 
of scorching color. While the Fauves used strong color to give their paintings 
a rawness and immediacy, Kittredge seems to use her intense palette more out of 
habit than anything else, and the work suffers from a cloying sameness as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
ART NOTES . . . 
</P>
<P>
The artists who have been designing posters for the Royal Chicano Air Force 
have one foot in the old, spiritually-charged world of pre-Colombian pyramids 
and the other in the brash present. In their work, symbols of Aztec and Mayan 
gods mingle with proclamations of political power, calls for boycotts and 
announcements of community events. 
</P>
<P>
A spirited collection of posters by the RCAF can be seen through October 14 at 
the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. The group, founded in Sacramento 
in 1968 by three artists, was intended "as a political action organizing body 
to express personal visions of Chicano rights through the magic of art." 
</P>
<P>
This retrospective look at the RCAF's efforts, from the collection of 
co-founder Ricardo Favela, reaches from the mundane to the militant. Benign 
posters announcing concerts hang next to sterner statements of solidarity with 
the United Farm Workers. The show resonates with nostalgia, though the roots 
and reasons for the movement remain very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoss McGraw, whose wry, whimsical works have both inspired and been inspired 
by poetry, has completed a new book. "Janet and DeLoss: Poems and Pictures" 
pairs five new poems and four translations from the Japanese by San Franciscan 
Janet Lewis with woodcuts by the San Diego-based artist. The book was published 
in an edition of 90 by Brighton Press, the local printmaking atelier that has 
published four other books illustrated by McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego artists on the move: Sculptor Anne Mudge and installation artist 
Mario Lara are included in the four-person show, "Ancient Stillness/Ancient 
Silence," at the Biota Gallery in West Hollywood, through October 13. The show 
was organized by Katya Williamson, formerly curator of public art for the 
Carlsbad Arts Office. . . . Joyce Cutler-Shaw is currently featured in an 
exhibition at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, The Netherlands. The show, titled 
"In Flight/Op Wieken," continues through November 24.

<HEADLINE>  THIRTY CENTURIES OF MEXICAN SPLENDOR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Art  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's the gripping saga of a flourishing native culture, the clash with its
conquerors and the ultimate reconciliation of the two strains in a synthesis
as beautiful and moving as a fugue.;   Told through about 400 works of art,
this is the story of 3,000 years in the life of Mexico.;   Forgotten America;
In common parlance, nortenos overlook the fact that the country is every bit
as much a part of the American continent as the United States.;   But as
"Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" demonstrates, the dramatic forging of
the American identity found no better stage than in Mexico, which was home to
one of the continent's most advanced Indian civilizations, bloodiest conquests
and sweetest resolutions.;   By contrast, the U.S. ethos always has been
dominated by the urge to start from scratch, so mainstream artistic trends
have yet to integrate our American Indian roots.;   But not so Mexico, whose
artists have a long tradition of smoothing ethnic differences by grafting the
traditions and customs of one group onto its successor.;   Historical cycle;
"The process of rupture, reintegration, rupture (and) reintegration can be
taken as a leitmotif of the history of Mexico," writes Octavio Paz, the
country's Nobel laureate, in the impressive catalog for "Splendors.";   The
exhibit, which will be on view through Dec. 29, traces this intricate
progression through seven pre-Columbian groups, 300 years of colonial rule and
100 searching years after independence from Spain.;   Such revered modern
masters as Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Frida Kahlo brought the
influence full circle. Melding ancient, folk and European traditions, they
were seeking to give voice to national pride in the wake of the Mexican
Revolution of 1910, but they ended up giving one of the most eloquent
descriptions of what it means to be both native and imported.;   "They showed
how one can bring together the past and present into a visual message that can
be a point of pride," explained Miguel Angel Corzo, now director of the Getty
Conservation Institute but formerly an exhibition organizer.;   In assembling
such an ambitious display, organizers have borrowed from dozens of major
museums in Mexico, Europe and the United States, as well as smaller museums at
far-flung archaeological sites in Mexico.;   "It's possible to see these
things in their homes," said Thomas Lentz, one of four curators installing the
exhibit. "But it would take you years and thousands of miles.";   Besides, the
intrepid traveler would miss all the hoopla surrounding the exhibit, which
comes to Los Angeles after popular runs in two other cities.;   At New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art, which started the exhibit last October,
"Splendors" attracted almost 600,000 visitors, making it a blockbuster,
officials there said.;   And at the San Antonio Museum of Art, where it closed
Aug. 4, the exhibit attracted nearly four times more people in five months
than the museum had seen in its best year.;   "It totally transformed San
Antonio," said Marion Oettinger, the museum's director.;   In Los Angeles, the
reception is expected to be no less spectacular.;   The largest exhibit ever
mounted at the museum, it will fill the museum's three main exhibition spaces,
spilling from the Robert O. Anderson to the Frances and Armand Hammer
buildings.;   The exhibit is so vast, so varied that even seasoned veterans
such as Virginia Fields, the museum's resident pre-Columbian expert, hadn't
seen some of the pieces before she unpacked them.;   "She'd go, 'Oh, my gosh,
I didn't realize it looked like this,' " Lentz said.;   Under any
circumstances, the exhibit spanning from 1000 B.C. to 1950 would be expected
to find an enthusiastic following among people of Mexican heritage, and the
museum is leaving nothing to chance.; Bilingual signs;   In an unprecedented
move, the museum is printing the exhibit's descriptive text in both Spanish
and English. It also has signed on bilingual docents to accommodate an
anticipated crush of Spanish-speaking visitors from Mexico as well as Los
Angeles and other parts of California.;   "In many ways, it will be a matter
of pride to see another country become so excited about one's cultural
heritage," Lentz said.;   It has been 27 years since the museum has staged a
overview of Mexican art from pre-Columbian to modern times. But by some
accounts, there hasn't been a comparable look at Mexican art since the
Metropolitan Museum of Art mounted "Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art" in 1940.;
  However it stacks up against previous Mexican exhibitions, "Splendors" can
already boast an unprecedented effect, having touched off a whole series of
events spotlighting Mexican and Mexican-American culture through February.;  
More than 300 lectures, films, exhibits and performances organized under two
banners -- "Artes de Mexico," a locally organized celebration; and "Mexico: A
Work of Art," a celebration that received support from the Mexican government
-- will complement the exhibit.;   Greater understanding;   Originally
proposed by the Friends of the Arts of Mexico, a U.S. foundation dedicated to
promoting awareness of Mexican culture, "Splendors" is designed to awaken a
deeper understanding of the country.;   "We wanted to have an exhibition that
would show Mexico and its very important historical contribution," explained
Miguel Angel Curzo, who was president of Friends of the Arts of Mexico during
that period. "There are very few countries that can boast 30 centuries of
constant artistic evolution, especially starting at the high level that this
exhibit does.";   Ultimately, however, the most lasting lesson may be the
beauty of synthesis, a lesson that, when ethnic and racial tensions dominate
local headlines, couldn't be better timed.;   "We haven't reconciled these two
worlds to the extent Mexico has," said Julie Jones, a curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art who helped assemble the exhibit.;   The story
begins in 1000 B.C. with massive stone sculptures carved by Olmecs, the
founders of the first complex civilization in the Americas.;   It will be
impossible to miss the 5-ton Colossal Head, a thick-featured head of an Olmec
man that stands 5 feet tall. Stunningly modern-looking, the highly stylized,
helmeted statue that probably had some religious connotation looks as though
it were carved in the 1920s to immortalize a football player.;   The head,
like the equally weighty Olmec "Seated Figure," exemplifies the organizers'
concerted effort to include large stone sculptures from every pre-Columbian
site represented.;   There is a 6-foot stela from Monte Alban near Oaxaca, a
6-foot column from El Tajin on the Mexican Gulf, a choice Chacmool statue from
Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, and so on.;   Themes -- such as the plumed
serpent, a god revered in one form or another by so many Indian cultures --
surface, disappear and then re-emerge transformed, from a first-century Olmec
burial urn, to a 10th-century bas relief from Veracruz to a 16th-century
sculpture from Tenochtitlan.;   Likewise, sensibilities repeat over and over
again in the manner of a haunting melody. No sooner will you shake the chill
of a hideously disfigured Olmec deity, than the old Mexican fascination with
the macabre will raise its head in the form of intricately carved,
2,000-year-old human bones. Or in the 19th-century cartoons by Mexico's master
caricaturist Jose Guadalupe Posada. Or in Kahlo's deliciously gruesome stabs
at exorcising the pain of crippling spinal injury and resulting
childlessness.;   (box); IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty
Centuries" will be on view through Dec. 29 at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art. Call (213) 857-6000 for more information.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
Perhaps no account of the fate of the Amerindians since Columbus could be
dispassionate. Home of the Brave, its title ironically provided by The Star
Spangled Banner, takes a highly charged subject and does all it can to
elicit an emotional and political response from its audience as it is
propelled from 15th century Castile to the White House. In more ways than
one, this 'amazing new museum experience' is a provocative as well as
spectacular European contribution to the Columbus quincentennial.
It is indeed an experience, a touring, Pounds 2m, multi-media tour-de-force
organised by Glasgow Museums and the Fondation Mecenat Science et Art of
Strasbourg. Visitors make their way through a sequence of dimly lit
stage-set galleries which chart the discoveries of the Americas and the
relentless quest for Eldorado. We travel with Columbus to the Bahamas and
the Caribbean islands, with Cortes to Mexico, Pizarro to Peru, and Jacques
Cartier to Canada. En route we encounter a recreated pueblo village and an
Iroquois longhouse.
As we progress, our cordless headsets pick up the music specially composed
by Phillipe Eidel, background sounds of dripping rain forest and crackling
fire, plus the narrative from the short films playing on the wide TV screens
clustered at seven different sites. There are things to touch: an Olmec
stone jaguar head from 1500BC Veracruz; a buckskin; a snowy feather
headdress and a recently carved 4m high totem. The borrowed tepee even
offers the lingering fragrance of the camp fire. Effects and videos are
exceptionally well done, and the headsets ensure peaceful viewing even if
surrounded by schoolchildren. The pitch is popular, but the quality of the
exhibits is sufficient to captivate the enthusiast for hours.
Glasgow has chosen to focus its show on peoples already familiar to its
audience, and British museum collections unsurprisingly boast rich holdings
of North American Indian artefacts. A far greater treat, however, is the
astounding and generous loans from Mexico. Here are dozens of sculptures,
bas reliefs, frescoes, ceramics and other ritual artefacts that have
survived from the pre-Columbian civilisations of South America. What is
maddening is that one wants to know more about the objects than the bald
captions supply, and the book - rather than catalogue - accompanying the
show does not oblige.
An elaborately carved chalk head from 500-700AD Chiapas, its intertwining
symbols forming a pictorial text, introduces us to a group of Mayan
rarities. A second gallery concentrates on the remarkable clay figurines and
vessels produced 1150-100BC, largely by the Olmecs or under their influence.
One naturalistically relaxed Guerrero figure from 1150-100BC is of a
well-coiffed woman sitting cross-legged in a fringed skirt, her left arm
supporting her weight. The garment draped across her shoulders might almost
be a cardigan. Zapotec funeral urns depicting various divinities are another
highlight.
No doubt much interest is generated by the basalt figure of one of the 400
Aztec gods of intoxication, and by the objects associated with the last
years of Aztec human sacrifice. Flint knives, some decorated with eyes and
teeth, were used to cut out human hearts which were then offered to the sun
to refresh the cosmic energy. Such rituals were to horrify the Spanish
Conquistadores, but was their own Auto da Fe any less morally reprehensible?
Inevitably, the exhibition book is able to explore more fully the
circumstances that compelled the confrontation of the Old and the New
Worlds, the subsequent devastation and, at times, the vital merging of the
two. (Americas Lost, edited by Daniel Levine, published by Bordas, Pounds
19.)
One of the strangest aspects of the chance discovery of the new continent is
how, again and again, the native Americans offered so little resistance to
relatively few Spanish troops and accepted their subjugation. Most of them,
it seems, anticipated the return of white and bearded divinities. That helps
us to understand why the Amerindians were literally demoralised when the
whites revealed themselves not as gods but as slaughterers and oppressors.
Their whole concept of the world was destroyed.
Certainly the record of the European presence in the Americas is shameful.
It is estimated that some 80 per cent of the native population disappeared
during and immediately following the Spanish Conquest. Smallpox and measles
brought death to thousands. The Old World gave its diseases, but took land,
slaves, and the plundered the continent's mineral resources. The great
monuments of the Aztec and Inca empires which had so amazed the
conquistadores were razed to the ground, and Catholic churches erected in
their place.
Unlike the Spanish, the British and French in the North showed little
inclination to intermarry and preferred to colonise Indian land. By the late
1770s, the colonial population outnumbered the Indians. By the end of the
19th century, the Indians had all but shared the fate of the buffalo. It is
with the history of the North American Indian that the exhibition, unlike
the book, loses its balance and objectivity.
We find a muslin tunic taken at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 -
complete with bullet hole - among the pieces placed in old-fashioned museum
display cases. This presumably signifies the end of the living culture of
the Redskin and the beginning of the villainous White Man's ethnography. In
the same room, called 'The Old Museum', the TVs run the old cowboy and injun
movies that celebrate the pioneer's version of American history.
'Pacified America' offers an emotive climax. Its walls are lined with
colourful hand-blocked panoramic wallpaper first produced by Zuber in 1834,
and which hangs in the White House. Entitled 'Scenic America', its portrays
the North American Indian reduced to the indignity of curiosity as he dances
for the amusement of the white man. In the centre of the room, exhibited
behind a wire fence, are a dozen of the 40,000 sepia photographs taken by
Edward S. Curtis at the turn of the century to record the fading glory of
the redskin. They make a mockery of the words of the Star Spangled Banner
resounding in our ears.
In their simplistic portrayal of Indian life, the organisers of this
otherwise excellent exhibition are in danger of romanticising the North
American Indian and simply replacing the myth of the western with another of
late 20th century making, ecologically sound and politically correct.
The exhibition continues at the McLellan Galleries, Glasgow, until September
20, then on to Paris, Strasbourg, Munich, Lyon and Bordeaux

ART WORLD: SOVIET ARTIST SURFACES AT USC GALLERY

FACES 
</P>
<P>
"In art you need some tragedy. Where would we be without that?" asks 
Leningrad-based painter Gleb Bogomolov, referring to a 40-year period in which, 
he says, the development of Russian art was "completely cut off." 
</P>
<P>
Bogomolov should know about that tragedy in Russian art; he has long been 
recognized as a leader of the Soviet Union's underground art scene. But 
Bogomolov was one of the lucky ones. He has been able to make an underground 
living through his work, which he has been selling to foreign diplomats and 
collectors for more than 10 years -- long before Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is included in "Keepers of the Flame: Unofficial Artists of Leningrad" 
at USC's Fisher Gallery through Jan. 19. In addition, he has his first Los 
Angeles solo show at George Mayers Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard through Dec. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
"My condition has not changed, except that now I can go abroad, I can travel 
with my works," says the artist, who is currently on his first visit to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although his English is excellent, the 57-year-old artist with the ready grin 
insists on using an interpreter so that the "subtle nuances" of his 
conversation will be understood. Frequently, however, he finds himself helping 
out the interpreter with those very nuances. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, since being officially "recognized" by the Soviet 
government, Bogomolov has shown at several prestigious Soviet institutions, 
among them the Russian Museum, Far East Museum, Museum of Leningrad and 
Moscow's Museum of Modern Art. He has also shown in Norway and Sweden, and is 
currently featured in the large-scale exhibition "The Quest for 
Self-Expression: Painting in Moscow and Leningrad, 1965-1990" at Ohio's 
Columbus Museum of Art. But times were not always so easy for the artist, who 
left his state job as an engineer 13 years ago to devote himself to life as an 
underground artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something contrary to society," Bogomolov remembers. "Before 
perestroika, we were to be a (slave) to what we were told. But I was always 
doing what I wanted to do. I was supposed to work officially, but I didn't want 
to do it, even though they could imprison me for having no official job. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult trying to be an artist. They tried to stop my work," 
continues Bogomolov, who had no formal art training, but began making art while 
still a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always striving for avant-garde work," he says. Bogomolov did not become 
an "official artist," he says, because he did not want to always paint what he 
was told to, or paint in the official style of Socialist Realism. 
</P>
<P>
He notes, however, that because his work relies heavily on old Russian icons, 
he may be seen more as following old traditions that new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the avant-garde often leans on old traditions," he says. "I 
always turn to the tradition of icon painting because I think our modern times 
and ancient culture are very connected to each other. We have the literal 
result now of what was happening in ancient times." 
</P>
<P>
In his mixed-media paintings, Bogomolov often depicts "only vague remains of 
something that is not understood" thus causing the viewer to "guess" the 
piece's meaning. Such is the case with "Shrine," a work included in the USC 
show, which features only one clear element, a hand of playing cards 
representing "absolute mockery and a challenge that takes away from old history 
and culture." 
</P>
<P>
"I think (works like this) are a consequence of my experiences of spiritual 
tragedy," Bogomolov says of the suffering he underwent as an "unofficial" 
artist in the Soviet Union before Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
Photographers + Friends United Against AIDS, which mounted "The Indomitable 
Spirit" traveling exhibition seen at the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery earlier 
this year, has donated $350,000 to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
To date, the organization has raised nearly $1.2 million through the 
exhibition, catalogues and a connected portfolio. A second limited-edition 
portfolio featuring works by artists including Andres Serrano, David McDermott 
and Peter McGough is planned for release in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
HAPPENING 
</P>
<P>
Artists including Leo Limon, Dolores Guerrero-Cruz, Ricardo Duffy and Michael 
Amescua will participate in Self-Help Graphics third annual Christmas Arts and 
Crafts Sale, to be held at the East L.A. gallery today from 2-6 p.m. Works will

Fernando de Szyszlo, Peru's best-known painter, practices an art of fusion, 
melding together European and pre-Columbian motifs, abstract and figurative 
styles. His current show, at the Iturralde Gallery (7592 Fay Ave.) through Dec. 
13, reveals his work also to be of hybrid quality, at one moment rich and 
suffused with mythical power, the next decorative and gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
Szyszlo, who was born in 1925, studied architecture in his native Lima before 
shifting his focus to art. He lived in Paris, Florence and several American 
cities sporadically throughout the 1950s and '60s, but since then has been 
based primarily in Peru. His work has been collected and exhibited 
internationally, and was recently seen at the San Diego Museum of Art in the 
traveling exhibition "The Latin American Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The paintings and prints in the Iturralde show, all from the 1980s, speak in 
the highly personal vocabulary of forms that Szyszlo has developed over his 
40-year career. Occasionally, his shapes and patterns resonate with those found 
in pre-Columbian art and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in each work in the series, "Mar de Lurin" (Sea of Lurin), 
Szyszlo sets a blocky vertical shape before a horizontally striated background. 
The vertical form vaguely suggests a human figure, but its articulated sections 
also recall ancient stele and the colossal columns of Toltec temples. While the 
background appears landscape-like, its undulating layers of patterns also echo 
the meandering geometric ornamentation of ancient Mesoamerican temples. 
</P>
<P>
Szyszlo's affinity with ancient cultures surfaces throughout his work, though 
subtly. In "Anabase," a gouache painting on paper from the series, the artist 
pictures a flat ocher plane studded with squat, pyramidal forms. A knot of hot 
color and swirling shapes rushes toward these structures on the horizon with 
the blind fury of an impending storm. Szyszlo may be pitting the flux and fury 
of modern civilization against the solidity and permanence of the ancients in 
this powerful image, just as he may be representing the classic dichotomy 
between nature (the horizontal) and culture (the vertical) in his "Mar de 
Lurin" series. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest of Szyszlo's images sustain and even encourage such lofty 
interpretations, but others trade this poetic tension for trite decoration, and 
abandon the artist's fiery hues and ominous shadows for a palette of lipstick 
pinks. 
</P>
<P>
After a generation of hard-edged abstraction, minimalism and conceptualism, 
painting has made a comeback on the American scene. Impassioned brushwork flung 
itself with fervor onto gallery walls in the early '80s in the work of 
neoexpressionists, while young "new image" painters and others professing a new 
romanticism have breathed life into an otherwise arid artistic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
For some artists, however, painting never died. Its potential to satisfy the 
senses and nourish the spirit never even waned during the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Geer Morton, for one, has been frosting canvases with lush, juicy pigment for 
30 years, undetered by opposing winds of taste and popularity. "East Coast, 
West Coast," at the Tarbox Gallery (1202 Kettner Blvd.) through Dec. 9, joins 
paintings from a short-term stay in San Diego with works from Maine and 
Northern California, where the artist maintains homes. 
</P>
<P>
Morton's work makes no intellectual claims and has no pretenses of conceptual 
currency. It is refreshingly free of rhetoric, relying only on rich color, 
genuine emotion and uncontrived gestures for its appeal. Morton's creamy tones 
and abbreviated representational style owe much to his mentors of the '60s, Bay 
Area painters Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff and David Park, but his work 
feels more modest in intent. He clings to traditional themes -- landscapes, 
floral still lifes, figure studies -- and seeks in earnest to capture the 
fleeting light and mood of each arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Morton's fluid strokes have a natural affinity with their organic subjects, and 
it comes as no surprise that his paintings of cities, with their blocky, static 
monoliths, are the least convincing. Flowers, however, seem to continually 
regenerate his painterly energy, and each arrangement maintains its 
individuality and integrity. A dozen distinct brush strokes in a subtle range 
of tones define a small glass vase in "Porch With Flowers," exemplifying the 
artist's keen regard for even the most nondescript objects. 
</P>
<P>
Deep ochers, teals and violets balance against shimmering whites, golds and 
fleshy pinks in Morton's ceaselessly varied palette. Morton makes each canvas a 
celebration of the transitory moment, for he knows that color and light never 
meet the same way in the same place twice.

MEXICO CITY YIELDS MORE CLUES TO PAST;

A PRE-SPANISH SKULL, TABLETS ARE DISCOVERED BY REPAIRMEN UNDER A DOWNTOWN 
MANSION.

For a captured warrior in the Aztec Empire, the most honorable way to die was 
fighting. Tied to a giant stone, the prisoner would do battle against four 
gladiators at once. In death, he -- or she -- was decapitated, a sacrifice to 
the gods. 
</P>
<P>
This, anthropologists say, may have been the fate of the Indian soul whose 
skull was unearthed in downtown Mexico City last month five feet beneath a 
colonial mansion that was undergoing restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, diggers found what may be the key to the skull: six stone tablets 
depicting dismembered limbs, symbols of divine blood and acorns for the god 
Xipetotec, one of the many Aztec gods to whom sacrifices were made. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we have found something like this downtown," said 
anthropologist Elsa Hernandez, who is in charge of the urban site. "The cranium 
is deformed. That is a characteristic of someone of high social class. As 
babies, their heads were bound with pieces of wood in the front and back until 
the bones gave way. It was considered beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologists, who are just beginning to study the skull and tablets, are far 
from certain to which god the offering was made. But they consider the new find 
another clue to unraveling the mysteries of Mexico's extensive and often grisly 
pre-Spanish past. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish conquerors built Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital, 
Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Templo Mayor, or Great Temple pyramid, was discovered 
in 1978, a block from the Spanish-built National Palace and the Roman Catholic 
cathedral. The Templo Mayor was the principal religious site, surrounded by 
lesser pyramids dedicated to minor gods. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion at Argentina 12, where the skull and tablets were found, was built 
atop one of those. The temple was directly in front of the Templo Mayor and is 
believed to have been dedicated to either Coateocalli, the god of prisoners, or 
to Cihuacoatl, a serpent woman and goddess of land. The discovery may help 
anthropologists decide which one. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 18th Century, Spanish tax collector Jose Francisco de Fagoaga 
y Arozqueta bought the land and commissioned Valencian sculptor Manuel Tolsa to 
build his three-story mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Fagoaga's elegant home was completed in 1805, five years before Mexico's war of 
independence from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the 20th Century, the Mexican government bought the colonial 
building to house its growing bureaucracy, using it for one of its ministries. 
Since then, the mansion has been in continuous use by various government 
offices. In 1988, it was turned over to the National Council for Culture and 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1901, archeologists discovered the stairway to a pyramid beneath the 
mansion's central patio. Soon afterward, they unearthed a carved stone jaguar, 
called Cuauhxicalli, with an opening in its back for offerings to the Aztec 
gods. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City, sitting on a dry lake bed prone to earthquakes, shakes like a soft 
bed under a restless sleeper. Its colonial buildings teeter, sink and crack. In 
1985, while repairing the foundation of Argentina 12, workers discovered a 
stone eagle the size of a sheep. 
</P>
<P>
The arts council has continued restoring the building amid the desks and 
paperwork. When fixing a crack last month, workers found the skull and tablets 
in the corner of a storeroom. 
</P>
<P>
"These are pieces of the great mosaic that was the ceremonial center of 
Tenochtitlan," Hernandez said. "They are pre-Hispanic information." 
</P>
<P>
Such digging goes on throughout downtown Mexico City, despite hordes of street 
vendors, office workers, shoppers and tourists. One gets the impression that 
all of the central city is sitting atop a pre-Spanish treasure chest: The Sun 
Temple was discovered beneath the cathedral in 1976; the Education Ministry 
building is being excavated now. 
</P>
<P>
By law, anthropologists may examine all downtown work sites and renovations of 
colonial buildings. The subsoil is under the guardianship of the National 
Institute of Anthropology and History. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes they arrive too late. Workers renovating the San Agustin Church 
on Uruguay Street shoveled up a graveyard of Spanish viceroys before 
anthropologists could get to them. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers don't like us anthropologists very much because we interrupt their 
schedule," Hernandez said. "But we have the right and obligation to go in. This 
is our history."

<TEXT>
<P>
With city government funds available to individual artists for the first time 
through the L.A. Endowment, an exhibition at Cal State Northridge's North 
Gallery seems timely. The exhibition, "The Fugue," documents artist Jack 
Reilly's execution and installation of a public arts commission in the city of 
San Diego (a steel sculptural painting on the 120-foot wall adjacent to the 
entrance of the County of San Diego's new Health Services Complex). 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes photo documentation of Reilly's work in progress, 
models from the original proposal, a scaled-down version of one of the pieces, 
and a 30-minute video documentary of the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
The North Gallery is on the college campus, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. The 
short-lived exhibition closes on Friday. 
</P>

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Marvellous monsters from Mexico - From the Oltecs to
Frida Kahlo, Patricia Morison finds them all in Belgium at the Europalia 93
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM Antwerp to Zonhoven, cultural events with a Mexican accent spatter the
map of Belgium from now until Christmas. Mexico in Europe is the title of
Europalia 93. Events span the conventional arts and go beyond to include
horsemanship, numismatics, literature (presided over by Octavio Paz and
Carlos Fuentes), and papel picado or paper-cutting. Free to all comers is an
seven-day linguistics seminar on Mexican Spanish at Antwerp.
But what is Europalia? The unkind answer would be, a Belgian arts festival
which leaves the French cold and blank looks from most culturally aware
Britons. Yet Europalia has quite a pedigree. It was set up in 1969 as a
non-profit making, multi-disciplinary biennial arts festival to provide a
cultural window onto the member states of the EC. In 1989, it drew 1,660,000
visitors. A measure of devolution has crept in and events now spill over to
Maastricht, Rotterdam, even Paris.
Certain EC countries have yet to take the stage - Luxemburg for one, Ireland
for another. In 1989, Portugal declined on grounds of expense (her turn came
in 1991). The foundation's invitation to Japan threw Europalia open to all
comers; Scandinavia and Turkey currently contend for the 1995 slot.
Staging Europalia is not cheap. Belgium covers all costs within the country,
the guest nation pays the rest. This year, Mexico's costs were approximately
Dollars 20 million while Belgium's were roughly half, which is the standard
proportion. Where formerly there was a plethora of sponsors, this year, in
addition to the National Lottery, the Belgian end has six 'structural'
sponsors, each contributing BFr10 million: Alcatel Bell, Batiments et Ponts
Construction, Bekaert, Belgacom, Generale de Banque, and Swift.
So much for the Europalian nuts and bolts. In my own area of the visual
arts, Mexico has fielded some sumptuous exhibitions and others which sound
promising but I had no time to see. Sinister and heavy with the reek of
blood, Mayan archaeology is the festival's glory. Two large exhibitions must
be seen; The Eagle and the Sun, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts until December
19, and Maya-Metropolis at the Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in
Cinquantenaire Park until December 24.
A statue out of a nightmare, lifesize on a high plinth, stands guardian to
'The Eagle and the Sun'. It is made out of modelled and cast sections of
blackish-red like a ghastly mechanical toy. A human torso and legs balance
on feet with triple talons curved upwards. The face and huge ears of this
god of Oaxaca are clearly those of a bat. With its gaping mouth and four
great canine teeth, there seems every reason to believe that the three clay
bells on its neck sounded the death-knell for human sacrifices.
'Anthropomorphised mouse, Zapotec culture' is as far as the label goes and
the catalogue, beautifully photographed though it is, is not much more
informative. This is not an exhibition which seems to want to instruct its
public nor is it stylishly displayed. Yet despite this, the show is a
memorable introduction to pre-Columbian art.
It aims to be more, the theme being 3,000 years of Mexican art from the
Oltecs (1200-600 BC) to Frida Kahlo. However, Mexico after its conquest by
Hernan Cortes in 1521, is on the whole only thinly evoked with certain
exceptions from New Spain. My favourites were a remarkable 17th-century
painted genealogy of the family of Mendoza Moctezuma and four paintings by
Miguel Cabrera in the genre of scenes illustrating New Spain's rigid caste
system.
The pre-Columbian rooms are surely where you will want to linger. More than
100 pieces have been sent by museums all over Mexico, for the most part
sculptures, some of them large and of superb quality. A number of the best
pieces stand free of glass cases like the vampire-god, which increases the
almost palpable air of menace.
Many figures peer through rings strangely like spectacles or have skin
welted by snaking cicatrices. Some of the more human creatures sit on the
ground, cross-legged or hunched. Warriors, priests, or victims, they serve
gods who stand four-square under their plumed head-dresses displaying the
emblems of divinity, eagles, serpents, the skulls which to this day are
omnipresent in Mexican folk-art.
A statue of a god of the Totonacs clasps a severed head by a handle as if it
were his handbag. He comes from the Gulf of Mexico and belongs to the
centuries equivalent to Europe's Gothic age. To form a picture of which
peoples were active when, Maya-Metropolis is the far and away the better
show, a survey of the Mayan city-states from the Yucatan to the Nicaraguan
frontier in the classical and post-classical period (200-1500AD).
The aim is to show how distinct these city-states were. Anyone not reading
French (or Dutch) is at a disadvantage although the show has a a clear
lay-out. Essentially it is one large space mapped chronologically into
city-states - Bonampak, Jaina, Chichen Itza, Palenque, and so on. Stylish
design puts stepped details and turquoise decoration everywhere to suggest
Mayan temples.
Astonishing and even beautiful things are in the show. Highly carved
figurines from Jaina, the island necropolis, have jointed limbs and
detachable shields for the warriors, like Action Man dolls, as well as
figures such as old women and hunchbacks who have much to tell
archaeologists about Mayan society. Here is the show to discover the Mayans'
incredible skill at using primitive means to carve obsidian and jade.
The catalogue, clear and readable, will give you the latest from the bloody
Mayan battlefield, whether the hieroglyphs really can be read (yes is the
answer). My world is the richer for learning that jade comes from Spanish
for 'stone of the kidneys', ijada, because the conquerors followed Mexican
practice in taking powdered jade as a medicine. No doubt that was the fate
of many fabulously carved necklaces such as stout Cortes gave his marquesa
on their betrothal. See also the very fine pre-Columbian rooms at the
Cinquantenaire museum which reopened last week after four years.
A smaller exhibition I liked is Crucible of Hope at the BBL headquarters,
place Royal 6. A survey of Mexican history from 1810 to 1910, it surveys a
century of revolution. The Belgian link is poignantly presented, less in the
person of Empress Charlotte who, I learnt, was an insanely ambitious woman
who forced poor Maximilian to accept the throne, than in the story of the
Belgian volunteers who left from Oudenaarde to defend their princess.
Ghent has a superb exhibition of silver, mostly religious, from New Spain in
the fine new galleries of the Museum vor Sierkunst; and shows elsewhere
explore popular art through masks, Day of the Dead paraphernalia, and the
muralists. For a Europalia catalogue, ring 071 629 0230.

The Los Angeles Festival's emphasis on cultural diversity serves to remind us 
how culturally mixed the vocabulary of contemporary visual art has become. The 
festival, with its mandate to focus on the arts of the Southland's various 
ethnic groups, combined with the afterglow of the Museum of Contemporary Art's 
just-closed "A Primal Spirit," has made it abundantly clear that the work of 
contemporary visual artists cannot justifiably be roped off into isolated 
cultural communities. The artists may indeed base their work on their own 
heritage, but increasingly they are deeply affected by the conceptual movements 
and vocabulary of Western art that makes them participants in the 
globe-trotting '90s' "internationalization" of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Voices From the African-American Community," curated by Josine Ianco-Starrels, 
presents five male black artists enmeshed in their community and heritage yet 
speaking with the cosmopolitan tongue of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the show's strongest work is by two photographers. Dennis Olanzo 
Callwood's boldly graphic black-and-white photographs of closely cropped black 
legs, hands and faces have the straightforward emotional bluntness of all 
documentary photography. Carefully composed into a vaguely abstract harmony of 
shapes, these images are compelling encounters with an unexpected reservoir of 
silence. Willie Middlebrook's greatly enlarged silver prints unite innovative 
darkroom techniques with emotion laden portraiture. These tender images of 
family and friends emerge from their dripping, liquid grounds to gingerly avoid 
schmaltz by the strength of their scale and careful manipulation of the image 
by the artist. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Dickson's off-the-wall humor moves unencumbered between primitive and 
modern art. It is responsible for the wild-wheeled chariot "Bongo Kongo: 
Mobilization of the Spirit" and the color-spewing, formalized nonsense of 
"Tabernacle." Dickson is an enigma to be watched. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings by Frank Williams are less interesting. Their penchant for idealized, 
emotional self-portraits painted in acid, artificial color hits you over the 
head with messages of confinement and alienation. Only in the triptych pastels 
"Rhythm" does that sense of strangeness link up with something really deep. The 
combination of three disparate images allows the landscape and human 
vulnerability to undergo a ritual transformation into something foreign, 
ominous and ancient. Mathew Thomas' pigment- and clay-encrusted paintings 
easily get bogged down in their thick surface explorations and all the visual 
references to Zen emptiness and religious icons. Not until the surface becomes 
a literal ground for strangely shaped totemic forms suspended in front of the 
painting does the rich color and the painting's form begin to vibrate into 
something wonderfully alive. (Long Beach Art Assn. Gallery, 447 Long Beach 
Blvd., to Sept. 24.) 
</P>
<P>
Urban Debris: California painter Raymond Saunders is a world-traveling black 
artist whose work internalizes the cultures and imagery of the cities where he 
immerses himself. He collects pieces of signage, bits of old wrapping paper or 
other fragments of urban debris. He slaps this clutter onto large, black, 
painted grounds that read like old blackboards, newly asphalted streets or 
cosmopolitan billboards. Then he unites the whole with a loose structure of 
marks, hand lettering, graffiti or calligraphic splashes of bright, pure color. 
Even though the elements are spread around the black canvas panels like idle 
thoughts in the middle of the night, they maintain an intriguing sense of 
internal order. 
</P>
<P>
If Saunders' paintings refer to his world travels, they are also right at home 
patching together concepts of abstraction and representation in a single image. 
In this freewheeling kind of formal exploration of painting's limits, Saunders 
goes several directions at once. On one hand, the paintings muse about issues. 
When that issue is the art world, as it is in one untitled painting, Saunders 
can present tiny, perfectly lovely, chalk rendered images of "primary form" 
eggs tumbled against the quiet cynicism of paint-by-numbers realism and 
elementary school hopscotch games of get-it-right advancement. 
</P>
<P>
But in "Sameness in Etcetera" the artist shows that he can be intellectually 
formal by involving the painting's surface in a broad explosion of radiant 
color while intentional and random marks do battle for dominance. (Santa Monica 
College Art Gallery, 1900 Pico Blvd., to Oct. 27.) 
</P>
<P>
Sound and Vision: East meets West in an exhibit of the same name at the Woman's 
Building, where Japanese artist Mineko Grimmer presents two of her 
always-appealing sound sculptures made with wooden boxes and dripping pyramids 
of frozen pebbles. As her structures go, these are particularly simple 
constructions relying on a single bar of brass or two strands of metal guitar 
wire to generate sound from the falling pebbles. But the addition of a strong 
side light on each shallow water-filled box means that the back wall is awash 
with moving reflections as the water is disturbed by each icy drip or pebble 
drop. It's a lovely animated display that makes full use of the subtle visual 
elements for which the artist is known. 
</P>
<P>
Also showing are the small but haunting gouache on paper paintings of Hilary 
Baker. Reminiscent of Ed Ruscha's recent prints of contemporary icons, these 
linear drawings float mundane items like power lines, tractors and fences in a 
colored atmosphere of isolation and containment. As images of a rural America, 
these drawings are nondescript, thin to the point of being invisible and laced 
with a sense of desolation and holocaust. (The Woman's Building, 1727 N. Spring 
St., to Sept. 29.)

Orange County wades into its second hundred years facing a summer that's filled 
with a wider range of arts and entertainment activities than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Calendar staff of the Times Orange County Edition selects highlights among 
the hundreds of choices offered at the county's theaters, art museums, outdoor 
amphitheaters, concert halls, comedy clubs, movie theaters and elsewhere to 
stave off any summer doldrums that might dare to take roost. 
</P>
<P>
* War and revolution, race and culture, gender and economics are among the 
weighty topics to be explored in a major exhibit at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum that may well be the summer's most promising and provocative. "Committed 
to Print: Social and Political Themes in Recent American Printed Art," July 
15-Sept. 23, will include 144 prints and other works on paper from the '60s, 
'70s and '80s by more than 110 artists, all participants in the three-decade 
resurgence in politically charged and socially conscious art. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by New York's Museum of Modern Art, the exhibit's illustrious artist 
roster boasts such names as Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Jonathan 
Borofsky, Barbara Kruger, Chris Burden and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
Running concurrently at the Newport Beach museum will be a solo exhibit of 
works by Los Angeles artist Charles Ray, whose sensibility bridges sculpture, 
installation and performance art. 
</P>
<P>
* The Laguna Art Museum will also host two meaty shows this summer: 
</P>
<P>
"Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper," July 13-Oct. 7, gives the late California 
abstractionist her first major museum survey. DeFeo, a San Francisco artist, 
was associated with the poets and artists of the Beat generation. The exhibit, 
with more than 50 works on paper from 1956 on, is being organized by the 
University Art Museum, UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning the Tide: Early Los Angeles Modernists, 1920-1956," July 13-Sept. 16, 
features 80 paintings and 10 sculptures by 10 leading Los Angeles modern 
pioneers including Lorser Feitelson, Helen Lundeberg, Hans Burkhardt and Rico 
Lebrun. 
</P>
<P>
During July and August, the Laguna Art Museum will be open Fridays until 8 
p.m., in addition to normal hours of 11 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Conceptual Impulse," coming to Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa, 
will feature works in a variety of media. Seven artists who are "aggressively 
investigating ideas" are included in the exhibit, says curator Mark Johnstone. 
The show runs June 17-Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
* The Irvine Fine Arts Center is celebrating its 10th anniversary with "Top of 
the Crop: 10 Year Pick," through July 22. The multimedia exhibit is composed 
mostly of works by Orange County artists, selected by curator Dorrit Kirk 
Fitzgerald who has chosen one old and one new piece by each participant. 
</P>
<P>
The center will also host "Island Indonesia: Reflections of Art, Mirrors of 
Culture," a traveling, 160-piece exhibit of Indonesian artifacts presented in 
conjunction with the Festival of Indonesia, a national touring program. 
Textiles, ritual sculptures, jewelry and paintings from the 12th to the 20th 
Centuries will be on view from Aug. 18- Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
* The Orange County Center for Contemporary Art has once again chosen a 
superior Southern California curator to select artists for its annual juried 
exhibition. Judi Freeman, associate curator of 20th Century art at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, will officiate OCCCA's 10th annual juried show 
(to take place at its main location at 3621 MacCarther Blvd.) from July 18-Aug. 
17. Artists from the Western United States will be included. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, a range of ethnic groups should be represented in "Cross Cultural 
Currents in O.C.," July 18-Aug. 3 at Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery. 
Artists in the multimedia exhibit, curated by local artist Emigdio Vasquez, 
have either worked or lived in Orange County. Summer gallery hours (from June 
11 to September) are Tuesdays, 6 to 8 p.m.; Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A list of summer arts and entertainment activities for children will appear in 
Wednesday's Calendar.

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: EXPLORATION OF THE SEXES BOGS DOWN IN 
POLITENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Good manners can get in the way of good art. Demonstrating this are Carole 
Laventhol's new paintings, "The Gaia Series," on view at Mesa College Art 
Gallery. The series explores the female/male duality as both a sexual and a 
metaphysical opposition, but it does so too politely to bring forth anything 
particularly compelling or new. 
</P>
<P>
"Anima-Animus," of 1989, directly states Laventhol's concerns in its title, 
using terminology for female and male popularized by Carl Jung. It represents 
this polarity with two stone-like forms, one rounded and one rectilinear. Their 
physical relationship on the canvas can be described as touching, nudging or, 
maybe, penetrating. If the latter, the union is a cool and very discreet one. 
</P>
<P>
The same reticence restrains the 1987 painting, "Eidolon," and "Innerspace II" 
of 1988. These use contrasts of light and dark colors, smooth and rough 
surfaces, and compositions of paired forms to express the artist's idea of 
interacting opposites. This represents a very familiar game in abstract 
painting. In the comfort of this familiarity, novel expression and impact are 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of these geometric works are so aloof, however. In "Attracting Chaos" 
of 1988 an orb and a spiked ribbon shape generate a visual tension that 
appropriately suggests the excitation inherent in their apparently imminent 
union. It is noteworthy, though, how the title suggests the attitude of the 
artist concerning this prospect. The prediction of "chaos" in the title, with 
its implication of undesirable outcomes, raises a question of whether the 
artist is uncomfortable with certain aspects of what she's dealing with: that 
in the contrast between the erotic as a physical reality and the erotic as a 
metaphysical reality, she is at ease with the latter, but discomforted by the 
former. 
</P>
<P>
This resulting distancing from possibly impolite passions even has its 
equivalent in the artist's handling of materials. Her thick paints, and the raw 
edges of the large, unstretched canvases suggest an indulgence in sensuality. 
Yet the colors throughout are kept uniformly cool. This is not so unexpected in 
the blues, greens and earth tones that pervade the work, but seems peculiar in 
the reds, which are warm at best, but never hot. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, all the images are coated with a slick, clear glaze that acts 
like Saran Wrap. For the eye, this closes off contact with the physical stuff 
of paint and canvas the way a glove gets in the way of holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps recognizing what was happening in the paintings, the most recent works 
in the series, all produced this year, reveal Laventhol incorporating figures, 
primarily female ones, into her imagery. In "Venus," she reproduces the 
30,000-year-old "Venus of Willendorf." This tiny statuette of a very robust 
female was created deep in the past, where one imagines that primal forces 
operated much more directly on human life than they do today. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of this knowledge, the image, in Laventhol's painting, fairly 
clobbers one over the head as a symbol of femaleness both literal and primal. 
Laventhol presents this ancient Venus as a giantess placed in front of a series 
of archways that closely quote another source: a painting by the Italian 
surrealist De Chirico. It is not difficult to ascribe male attributes to the 
architectural elements of Laventhol's painting and then to contrast these with 
the complementary aspects trumpeted by the female figure. But nothing comes of 
this because the maleness and femaleness don't meet. They're separated by a 
rigid screen of color and surface effects that locks each into quite disparate 
spaces. So much for the spice of life. 
</P>
<P>
A similar isolation of elements occurs in "Discomposed Woman," in which a nude, 
richly rounded female appears merged into a slab of pale stone. Above the slab 
is a smaller, blue, stone form next to which are the head and shoulder of a 
shadowy figure that may or may not be male. Surprising here is the way the head 
of the female is cropped off by her fit into the stone slab. Feminists 
generally find such treatment offensive and sexist for emphasizing women as 
objects at the cost of their full humanity. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that this is the issue Laventhol is focusing on, it represents a 
retreat from her broader concerns in favor of the more specific territory of 
real interactions between real people. As an illustration of sexist attitudes 
and consequences, the painting is effective but leaves one wondering where the 
artist's passions are in all of this. 
</P>
<P>
The one work that goes beyond this limitation is "God's a Woman." Here, a nude 
female sits on the bottom of the painting's edge, facing into the space of the 
scene, where she confronts a dark shadow image of herself. This black shape 
appears joined to a massive crucifix that looms across the format on a bold 
diagonal. Beyond this, a dim face emerges from the painting's gray background. 
However, this face seems superfluous because the interaction of the fleshy and 
shadowy figures and the weighty cross possess so much more drama. Here one sees 
a self directly confronting itself, both physically and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
The image is private and universal simultaneously. In it, Laventhol brushes 
aside simplistic politeness and seems personally invested for the first and 
only time in this exhibition. The return on her investment is a compelling work 
that begins to fully enter the domains that she otherwise only scratches the 
surface of in the "Gaia Series." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues through June 16 at Mesa College Art Gallery, which has 
done commendable work in organizing the show and publishing a 42-page 
illustrated catalogue that thoughtfully surveys this San Diego artist's past 
and current work.

<LEADPARA>  A revolution has taken place without most of us being aware of it. The results
of the revolution will be on display at this weekend's Cinco de Mayo
celebration in downtown San Jose.;    Most of us know that in the first half
of the 19th century, Mexicans ruled California before the Anglos came and, in
1848, forever changed the good life that the Mexican Californianos had here in
Santa Clara County.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We know that these Californianos owned huge ranchos but that they lost
their land, political influence and cultural dominance in the years following
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo when California was ceded to the United
States.;    In the last half of the 20th century, descendants of the
Californianos are coming back to assert their influence in current affairs
once again.;    As for la revolucion, Mexican people have a long history of
fighting for their independence. Cinco de Mayo itself is the commemoration of
their victory over Maximilian's French troops in 1862 at the Battle of
Puebla.;    That noisy revolution even made headlines in the United States.
But the quiet revolution of the past few years in California has barely caused
one head to turn.;    It had its beginnings in the 1960s, when
culture-consciousness was being raised throughout the United States. Part of
this was a new self-awareness of the contributions of Mexican-Americans in
California and the Southwest. As a number of Mexican-American leaders emerged
to exert influence in social, economic and political arenas, a resurgence of
interest in their culture -- the arts, crafts, music and dance -- grew among
other segments of the population.;    As in most revolutions the seeds were
sown many years before the fruit was harvested. Almost imperceptibly, our
colleges began to move away from strict adherence to the Euro-American
philosophies of art and to become more sensitive and aware of the validity of
art from other cultures.;    Young artists fostered;  As these new areas of
programming were explored, faculties collaborated with such unsung heroes as
San Jose Art Museum curators Albert Dickson and Marty Manson, to develop and
showcase young artists.;    George Rivera, curator of the Triton Museum in
Santa Clara, gives much credit to San Jose State University and the community
colleges in the area. Rivera was an art student at SJS in 1975 when he felt
his school was "the hub of all the energy in the area.";    A number of
non-profit galleries emerged about that time such as the San Jose Art League,
San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art and the Works Gallery. All continue
today to provide the most diverse forums possible. Each gallery holds
receptions, lectures and gallery exhibits -- taking chances on newly
developing talent.;    In the forefront of addressing today's need for
cultural pluralism, professor John Porter and instructor Sylvia Rios have
pushed an outreach program for the art department of Gavilan College in
Gilroy. Also, Euphrat Gallery in Cupertino's De Anza College has developed a
broad program for showcasing minority artists through the efforts of its
curator, Jan Rindfleisch.;    Artistic backers have a role;    Among those
taking individual responsibility for promoting the quiet revolution are local
artists, Erin Goodwin Guerrero and Consuelo Underwood, and San Juan Bautista
painter Eduardo Ramos. Al Preciado, and other members of the San Jose Fine
Arts Commission, have also extended a helping hand to struggling Hispanic
student artists.;    The San Jose chapter of the G.I. Forum has long worked to
provide exposure for Mexican-American art and has sponsored an exhibition
during the Cinco de Mayo celebration for several years.;    The tangible
results of the ongoing revolution in Chicano creativity will be on display at
the San Jose Convention and Cultural Facility at Park and Market streets from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Folk dancing will begin at noon as an added
attraction.;    The exhibition is free to the public under the joint
sponsorship of the G.I. Forum, the city of San Jose and its fine arts
commission.;    A list of the exhibitors for the art show includes San Josean
Pablo Soto and Los Gatan Hugo Lecaros. Maria Ortiz's Barrio Art Gallery will
display the work of fledgling artists age 13 to 18. Mary Andrade's sensitive
and perceptive photographs will also be shown.;    The crafts section will
feature the Maria Rodriguez handmade Mexican dolls in traditional costume, and
Luz Elena Limas will demonstrate her skill in creating handmade pinatas.;   
Joining the ranks of persistent fighters in the quiet revolution is Martin
Hernandez, gradually gaining recognition as a sculptor/potter. The San Joaquin
valley native was born 44 years ago into a migrant farm worker's family. He
grew up in the Tropicana Village subdivision of East San Jose. After working
his way through SJS, he graduated with a master's degree in art.;    Hernandez
calls himself "a hybrid American: part Mayan, part Papago Indian," and admits
it took him 30 years before he called himself an artist. He works part-time at
the Children's Discovery Museum and finally has been able to get his own
studio. His Blue Ribbon pieces that combine "mysticism and magical realism"
are strongly influenced by Mayan and Aztec themes.;    Hernandez is proud to
be the first Chicano artist in the area to have an original work on permanent
public display. His eight-foot sculpted wall was purchased by the Children's
Discovery Museum.;    Exhibitor Ramon Brusuelas, a former cabinet maker, found
his niche after an early retirement. Brusuelas, who, in the 1930s, went to
school barefoot in his native village of Tularosa, N.M., has a bachelor of
arts degree in industrial arts from San Francisco State University. He is a
teaching assistant in wood and ceramics.;    Hernandez, Brusuelas and their
peers, as effective combatants in re-establishing the intrinsic value of their
culture, are proving to be good role models for the next generation of artists.  </TEXT>

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: IN THE ART WORLD, JANUARY BECOMES THE MIDDLE OF 
THE YEAR

January may signal the beginning of a fresh, untried year -- and in the present 
case, a new decade -- but in the art world, it is a month like any other. More 
auspicious on the art world's calendar is September, when the new "season" of 
shows begins and galleries settle down to business again after the summer lull. 
Allegiance to an academic calendar that begins in the fall and ends with spring 
is steadfast among New York galleries, whose clients retreat from the sweating 
city during July and August. 
</P>
<P>
The same pattern holds in San Diego, though the population here swells in the 
summer. Galleries hang the traditional summer group shows, university and 
college spaces shut down, and museums often schedule their most broadly 
appealing shows. 
</P>
<P>
However nondescript a month for those in the art biz, January is here, now, and 
it has brought with it the rooted ritual of surveying the year ahead. The view, 
of one exhibition season half-completed and the next barely planned, is 
splintered, but telling. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego galleries and museums have on their books for 1990 a globe-trotting 
schedule that glimpses at the art of Indonesia, Poland, the Soviet Union, 
Mexico and England. Good neighbors to our area artists, they also keep one foot 
on local soil, anchoring the visionary with the responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Several voids will begin to be filled in the coming year. Two shows featuring 
contemporary African-American artists ought to restore at least a temporary 
sense of egalitarianism to the local scene. One, focusing on printmakers 
nationwide, opens Saturday at the Lyceum theatre, and was organized by the 
embryonic African-American Museum of Fine Arts. The other, at Grossmont College 
(Feb. 1-23), includes local and Los Angeles artists working in a variety of 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The void left by last year's closing of Installation, the downtown alternative 
space, is also expected to be filled this year. The gallery's board of 
directors is currently running the organization out of one board member's home, 
but they have begun the search for a new director and anticipate getting back 
on track by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
ARTWALK, the downtown art community's annual open house, coordinated by 
Installation, will take place April 21-22. Other holes in the fabric of the 
local art community may be left gaping this year. The large gallery space at 
9th and G, recently vacated by Dietrich Jenny and, before him, Mark Quint, 
awaits another brave soul willing to risk a fragile future as a contemporary 
art dealer for the sake of helping to keep downtown's art scene alive. 
</P>
<P>
New voids will also be created in 1990, as the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art closes its downtown space (this weekend) and maybe part of its La Jolla 
facility in the fall while it undergoes a major expansion. The museum is 
scouting about town for a temporary exhibition space -- or several -- in which 
to continue its programs until the expansion is completed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
What else to expect in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which 
will be publishing a book assessing its present and future endeavors. The 
gallery also plans a rich schedule of shows, from the annual eye-opening 
"Border Realities" installation by the Border Art Workshop, to a string of 
one-person and group shows featuring Native American artists, Chicano artists 
living in the Southwest and muralists from Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious global grazing on the part of local gallery directors will yield a 
promising array of shows this year. Mark Quint Contemporary Art will feature 
work by the Polish painter and photographer Mikolaj Smoczynski as well as the 
wry assemblages of British sculptor Richard Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet artists return to the local limelight at the David Zapf Gallery, which 
featured (along with the Mesa College Art Gallery) an engaging selection of 
paintings by Leningrad artists during last year's festival. More paintings by 
members of the Fellowship for Experimental Art will be seen at the gallery this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
German sculptor Franz Erhard Walther will present his brand of Minimalism in a 
series of abstract, dyed fabric works at the San Diego State University Art 
Gallery beginning February 9. Sculptures, murals, drawings and exuberant 
reliefs by the Basque artist Andres Nagel will be on view at the Tasende 
Gallery the following month. 
</P>
<P>
The Iturralde Gallery narrows its Latin American focus to concentrate on a 
handful of Mexican artists this year, while the Mingei International Museum of 
World Folk Art extends its gaze southward to present "Mayan Threads," a show of 
textile treasures from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists Manny Farber, Faiya Fredman, Graciela Ovejero, Reesey Shaw, David 
Baze, Nancy Kittredge, Roy David Rogers and others will add solo shows to their 
resumes this year, and ten as-yet-undisclosed locals will also be included in 
"Satellite Intelligence: Boston/San Diego New Art Exchange," this summer at the 
La Jolla Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Double-takes and murmurs will, as always, greet Sushi's StreetSites projects 
this year. In March, the performance and visual art gallery will plant three 
temporary public art works downtown to engage the community in dialogue on such 
issues as local growth and development, homelessness and censorship of the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Also bound to raise a few eyebrows is photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's "X" 
portfolio, to be shown at PhotoWest Gallery this spring. Homoerotic and 
sadomasochistic images from the series were at the heart of the recent 
congressional debate over government funding of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Two dwellings will be temporarily constructed in town this year -- one a 
shelter for the body, the other a refuge for the spirit. The San Diego Museum 
of Art presents "In the Realm of Ideas" this summer, featuring the work of 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright. As part of the exhibition, a full-scale "Usonian 
Automatic House," Wright's proposed solution to the need for moderate, 
custom-built housing, will be erected in the parking lot in front of the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
On a more intimate scale, Los Angeles artist Mineko Grimmer will create a 
site-specific installation for the Mesa College Art Gallery in May. Grimmer's 
organic sculptures pay homage to the musical theories of John Cage as well as 
to the Japanese reverence for the integrity, meditative potential and 
metaphoric possibilities of stone. Perhaps the most subtle of the year's 
offerings, Grimmer's work will seal the current season of shows and usher in 
the calm interlude before the next begins.

Sated as we are by reviews of the past year and decade, it's a relief to look 
ahead in 1990. Forget about the disappointments of 1989. Here come big 
exhibitions of art by Francis Bacon, John Baldessari, Kasimir Malevich, Henri 
Matisse, Claude Monet and Titian. The Soviets are sending more loan shows from 
their great museums, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is organizing a 
landmark exhibition on "The Fauve Landscape" and the J. Paul Getty Museum is 
planning a special show of ancient Cypriot art. 
</P>
<P>
In short, 1990 offers a typically impressive slate of celebrated names and 
ambitious projects -- particularly if you take a coast-to-coast view of 
exhibition highlights and if you extend both ends of the calendar year. The 
first 1990 event at the County Museum of Art, for example, is a double bill of 
contemporary artists' traveling retrospectives that debuted last year in other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
One is a survey of British artist Francis Bacon's work, organized by the 
Hirshhorn Museum in Washington to mark his 80th birthday in 1989. The eagerly 
awaited celebration of an artist whom many critics consider to be the best 
living painter will be at the County Museum of Art from Feb. 11 to April 29, 
then go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York (May 23-Sept. 4). 
</P>
<P>
"Helen Frankenthaler: A Paintings Retrospective," which honors a New York 
painter known for stained abstractions, premiered at MoMA last year. The show 
of 40 years' work will appear at LACMA from Feb. 11 to April 22, then have its 
final engagement (Nov. 5-Jan. 7, 1991) at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest feather in LACMA's cap this year may turn out to be a brand-new 
exhibition, called "The Fauve Landscape." Judi Freeman, the museum's associate 
curator of 20th-Century art, has selected 175 paintings made between 1904 and 
1906 by artists who were dubbed fauves (wild beasts) because of their use of 
vivid, unnatural color and their modern vision. The show will premiere at the 
County Museum of Art (Oct. 4-Dec. 30) before moving on to the Met (Feb. 14-May 
5, 1991) and the Royal Academy of Art in London, (June 13-Aug. 18, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most important 1990 exhibitions at Los Angeles' Museum of 
Contemporary Art are also major traveling shows. One, a long overdue 
retrospective for Los Angeles conceptual artist John Baldessari, was organized 
by MOCA and will appear there first (March 25-June 17). Then the show will set 
out on an exhaustive tour, going to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 
(July 12-Sept. 16), the Hirshhorn Museum (Oct. 16-Jan. 6, 1991), the Walker Art 
Center in Minneapolis (Feb. 3-April 28, 1991) and the Whitney Museum of 
American Art in New York (July 10-Sept. 29, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, MOCA will honor another internationally known Los 
Angeles artist, Edward Ruscha. His exhibition of about 50 paintings from the 
'80s, which was organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam and 
the Pompidou Center in Paris, will wind up in Los Angeles (Dec. 9-Feb. 24, 
1991) at the end of an international tour. 
</P>
<P>
As the world grows smaller through speedy transportation and instant 
communication, art shows take to the road almost as routinely as people. This 
tends to homogenize the art scene for frequent fliers, making it appear that 
the same exhibitions eventually pop up in every major city -- right next to 
McDonald's hamburger stands. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Angelenos continually complain -- with justification -- that 
many important exhibitions never come here. The 1990 list of major attractions 
that are not booked in the Southland includes the following: 
</P>
<P>
- "Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912-1913." The exploration 
of a short but vital period of the French modernist's oeuvre will be at 
National Gallery in Washington (March 18-June 3), New York's Museum of Modern 
Art (June 24-Sept. 4), the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow (Sept. 28-Nov. 
20) and the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad (Dec. 15-Feb. 15, 1991). The show 
will include 24 paintings -- about half of them from Soviet collections -- and 
36 drawings made while Matisse traveled around a country that he considered an 
earthly paradise. 
</P>
<P>
- "Titian, Prince of Painters." The assembly of 60 works will celebrate the 
Venetian Renaissance master's 500th birthday at the Ducal Palace in Venice 
(June 1-Oct. 7) and the National Gallery (Oct. 28-Jan. 27, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
- "Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings." Sure to be a popular success, the 
exhibition of 90 paintings will include images of haystacks, the Rouen 
Cathedral, gardens at Giverny and other subjects that Monet painted repeatedly 
during the 1890s. The show will appear at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston 
(Feb. 7-April 29), the Art Institute of Chicago (May 19-July 21) and the Royal 
Academy in London (Sept. 7 to Dec. 9). 
</P>
<P>
- "From Poussin to Matisse: The Russian Taste for French Painting." The 
Hermitage and Pushkin museums have agreed to lend 50 paintings for this 
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (May 20-July 29) and the Art 
Institute of Chicago (Sept. 8-Nov. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Regrettable as these losses may be, Los Angeles isn't exactly out of the 
traveling show loop. The County Museum of Art has scheduled a staggering array 
of exhibitions to be trucked in from afar. They include "Envisioning America: 
Prints, Drawings and Photography by Georg Grosz and His Contemporaries," 
featuring German Expressionist views of America (April 19-June 24); "Thomas 
Hart Benton: An American Original," a retrospective of 81 paintings by the 
American Regionalist (April 29-July 22) and "The New Vision," 125 innovative 
works by 70 modernist photographers (May 10-July 15). 
</P>
<P>
Also on LACMA's 1990 agenda of traveling shows are "A Primal Spirit: 10 
Contemporary Japanese Sculptors" (June 17-Aug. 26), "Treasures From the 
Fitzwilliam Museum" (June 21-Sept. 9) and "Masterpieces of Impressionism and 
Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection" (Aug. 16-Nov. 4). 
</P>
<P>
The first imported attraction at Armand Hammer's new museum in Westwood, which 
he plans to open in May, will be a landmark retrospective of works by Soviet 
modernist Kasimir Malevich (Nov. 25-Jan. 13, 1991). The exhibition of more than 
100 paintings and works on paper, primarily from Soviet museums, will have its 
first U.S. engagement at the National Gallery in Washington (Sept. 16-Nov. 4) 
and end a three-city tour at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Feb. 
3-March 24, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art will present paintings from the "AMERIKA" series 
by Tim Rollins and KOS, a highly publicized New York workshop for adolescent 
artists (July 8-Sept. 2). Among other imports, MOCA will adapt Ellen 
Sebastian's "Sanctified" performance piece as a collaborative exhibition with 
Betye Saar (April 22-July 22). "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the 
Aesthetics of Plenty" (Nov. 4-Jan. 13, 1991) will present a British group's 
responses to American technology, mass media and popular culture in a show that 
MOCA has jointly organized with the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, 
UC Berkeley's University Art Museum and the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum will start off the year with "Success Is a Job in 
New York: The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" (Jan. 21-March 18). This 
exhibition on Warhol's early development as a designer and artist, featuring 
194 works made between 1945 and 1963, was organized by the Grey Art Gallery at 
New York University. "Tony Cragg: Investigations into Chaos" is a Newport 
production, however, and a big one at that. The first solo American exhibition 
of works by the British sculptor will premiere at the Newport museum (Oct. 
14-Dec. 30) before going on a national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Still other exhibitions are for local consumption only. Out-of-towners will 
have to come here to see them. The California Afro-American Museum, for 
example, will present "The Blues Aesthetic: Black Culture and Modernism," an 
examination of a merger of blues music, black folk culture and modernist 
elements (Jan. 13-March 4). More or less concurrently (Jan. 31-March 3), USC's 
Fisher Art Gallery will offer "Celebrations: Sights and Sounds of Being," an 
exhibition of paintings, prints and sculptures by 25 African-American artists, 
which will be accompanied by taped music. 
</P>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum's exhibition program will continue to offer important 
glimpses of the museum's steadily growing collection in small, comprehensible 
shows. This year's agenda includes "Renaissance and Mannerist Drawings in 
Northern Europe" (Jan. 9-March 25), "The Art of the Written Word: Medieval and 
Renaissance Calligraphy in Illuminated Manuscripts" (Jan. 16-April 1) and 
"Carleton Watkins: Western Landscape and the Classical Vision," a show of 
19th-Century photographs (March 13-May 27). 
</P>
<P>
The Getty generally concentrates on its own art, but this year a rare loan 
exhibition will bring 32 objects from the Cyprus Museum and three from the 
Menil Collection in Houston together with a Getty-owned idol in a special 
exhibition called "Chalcolithic Cyprus" (Feb. 22-April 11). Sculpture and 
pottery dating from 3500 BC will include new finds from excavations at 
Kissonerga on the island of Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Whether any or all of these exhibitions -- not to mention hundreds of others -- 
will live up to our most optimistic expectations remains to be seen. It's a 
sure thing that both homebound and peripatetic art aficionados can keep very 
busy covering the 1990 scene.

   Columbia University is opening the first public gallery in New
York devoted exclusively to architecture.
   The gallery space in Buell Hall, which was constructed in 1876,
consists of 4,100 square feet. The building also houses the School
of Architecture.
   The first exhibition in the new gallery opens April 4 and runs
through May 11. ``The Filter of Reason: Work of Paul Nelson,''
focuses on the work of the American architect, movie set designer,
painter and critic who taught and practiced architecture in the
United States and France for more than 50 years.
   Nelson helped develop functionalism in the 1930s and '40s, a
movement that rejected beaux-arts traditionalism.
   Elsewhere, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has received an
unrestricted gift of $5 million from Akira Tobishima, president and
chief executive officer of Tobishima Corp., an international
engineering and construction company based in Tokyo.

   Masterworks in the permanent collection at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Houston are featured in the institution's first full-color
publication, ``A Permanent Legacy.''
   Published by Hudson Hills books, the 352-page work presents 150
full-page colorplates of works by the world's greatest artists,
including Renoir, Degas, van Gogh, Picasso, O'Keeffe, Matisse,
Sargent, Cezanne and Cassatt.
   ``During the 1980s, the museum has expanded to serve the varied
and complex demands of a major cosmopolitan city,'' said Peter C.
Marzio, the museum's director. ``As the museum has become a
cultural hub for the community, the need to document and celebrate
the collection has become apparent.''
   The museum's permanent collection contains more than 24,000
works of the Renaissance, English and early American decorative
arts, late 19th and 20th century European and American art and
photography. There is also Near and Far Eastern art, tribal arts
and ancient and early European art.
   Here is a list of shows and exhibits at some of the nation's

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: INDIAN WORKS SUCCUMB TO THE TRITE, OBVIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leah Ollman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tradition weighs heavy on the minds of Native American artists, but no more so 
than on the minds of the curators and public when viewing their work. 
</P>
<P>
Two current exhibitions encourage us to see contemporary Indian art in terms of 
its cultural heritage. "Traditions -- Old and New" at the Faith Nightingale 
Gallery (535 4th Ave.) and "Paths Beyond Tradition" at the Museum of Man in 
Balboa Park claim a continuity between contemporary Indian art and the rich 
Native American traditions of weaving, pottery, jewelry making and other arts. 
</P>
<P>
Artists in both shows incorporate traditional motifs from nature and ceremonial 
life in their work, and most in the Faith Nightingale show also remain faithful 
to the traditional materials of clay and fiber, feathers and stone. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the artists in either show, however, manage to transcend the art of 
their ancestors, or even to match its solidity and integrity. Instead, most are 
ensnared by the very traditions they claim as their inspiration. Mimicry, 
exploitation and a diluted sense of spirituality are all that link most of the 
contemporary artists represented here with their forebears. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 artists are included in "Traditions -- Old and New." Mike and 
Jackie Torivio's spectacular "Yucca Vase," in the Acoma tradition of precise 
geometric patterning, and Lucy Yearflower Tafoya's miniature black pots in the 
Santa Clara style of relief decoration demonstrate the vitality of traditional 
forms when subtly and gracefully extended into the present. 
</P>
<P>
Pahponee's "All My Relations" trilogy of pots merges ancient pictographic 
emblems of buffalo, birds, snakes and sun with a more contemporary mottled, 
smoky clay surface. Conrad House's "Two Mountain Lions," austere glass forms 
with edges encrusted with sand and midsections wrapped with feathers and 
stones, exude a convincing presence as modern-day fetishes. 
</P>
<P>
Such potent understatement is rare here, however. Much more common are blatant, 
garish expressions, such as Don Clark's drawings, which strive for a spiritual, 
mystical aura but instead wallow in the cheap theatrics of science-fiction 
illustration. George Walbye debases the traditional ceramic wedding vase form 
(two spouts emerging from a single vessel) by adding a portrait of an Indian 
bride and groom at the end of each spout. The elegant and symbolic thus succumb 
to the trite and obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Romanticized, sentimental visions prevail here, as does the stereotype of the 
Indian as a brave, proud and tragic -- not to mention generic -- character. In 
the end, the slick, predictable work insults the very tradition it means to 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Man exhibition also sags under the burden of abused cliches. 
William Franklin imposes gratuitous decorative schemes upon traditional 
geometric patterns and kachina motifs, bending and stretching the forms until 
they whirl dizzily across his canvases. Virginia Stroud paints idealized scenes 
of traditional Indian life using an artificially sweet spectrum of colors, with 
each rosy-cheeked squaw a cookie-cutter image of the one beside her. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these artists leaves much to the imagination. The melodramatic 
bronzes of Michael Naranjo and the stiff stone sculpture of Clifford Fragua 
suffer as well from their makers' formulaic and overly stylized approach. 
</P>
<P>
Only Michelle Tsosie Naranjo's delicate watercolors possess a mystery and magic 
that doesn't reek of forced spirituality. Her curious, abstracted mask forms 
float ambiguously on sheets of handmade rice paper, textured and saturated with 
deep blue and magenta pigments. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dancing for the Rain Gods," an attenuated human figure at the bottom of the 
thin, vertical sheet lifts one leg and arm in homage to the hovering masks 
above. Though not profoundly affecting, Naranjo's abstracted impressions 
nevertheless have a power entirely absent from the other artists' tight 
transcriptions of physical reality. 
</P>
<P>
Such familiar Indian symbols as the snake, hand and buffalo appear ad infinitum 
in the paintings and assemblages of Richard Glazer-Danay, but least of all to 
evoke a mystical or spiritual aura. The artist, familiar to local audiences 
through his inclusion in the San Diego Museum of Art's "Cultural Currents" 
exhibition last year, delights in a dense surface decoration that rarely, if 
ever, coheres into intelligible meaning. 
</P>
<P>
By coating the rotund wooden figures of "Fry Bread Fred and Fry Bread Freda" 
with vibrant renderings of ice cream sundaes, cherry pies and Coca-Cola, 
Glazer-Danay pokes fun at the unhealthy diet that plagues many reservation 
Indians, but he shies away from any deeper sociological or economic statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not searching for truth and beauty," his wall text reads. "I'm just having 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
The sheer exuberance of his painted surfaces grants the audience a good time, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Freeman's paintings also elicit smiles, but, even more than 
Glazer-Danay's work, they reduce complex, urgent subjects to simplistic 
one-liners. Freeman (who is also represented in the Faith Nightingale Gallery 
show) visualizes the clash between modern and traditional Indian ways of life. 
Beads and cigarettes, feathers and high heels, tepees and television sets all 
confront each other in his tableaux. Painted in tired, Southwestern decorator 
colors, Freeman's work merely glosses over a theme that deserves deeper 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the Native American artists who engage their own history, who address 
issues affecting Indian life today, and who examine the survival or abandonment 
of traditional values? "Traditions -- Old and New" and "Paths Beyond Tradition" 
implicitly ask these questions, but neither show provides a satisfying answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditions -- Old and New" continues through July 29. "Paths Beyond 
Tradition," which also includes work by David Dawangyumptewa, Edna Davis 
Jackson and Karen Lynn Noble, can be seen through Sept. 4.

COLLEGE MARKS ANNIVERSARY WITH MEXICAN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hot and sticky Saturday at the Cinco de Mayo celebration sponsored by 
the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, perfect weather for a nice cold 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
But Jered Standing was having trouble with the soda his mother had just bought 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can drink with this thing," complained the 10-year-old boy, 
referring to the still-wet plaster-of-Paris Mexican mask that a folk artist had 
just created for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaaah!" Standing said when artist Lonnie Miramontes gently pulled it off his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
All day long, children lined up to have their faces wrapped in gooey gauze. 
</P>
<P>
And when the masks dried, they sat under a shade tree to paint them with 
brilliant colors. 
</P>
<P>
Miramontes said he hoped to share a little of Mexican culture with the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that was one of the principal aims of the organizers of the Cinco de 
Mayo festival, which was held to celebrate the college's 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really making an effort to bring these two cultures together," said Sue 
Bozman, the college's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Another purpose was to encourage Latinos to become familiar with the college. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really trying to do is outreach for the Mexican community," Bozman 
said. "To let them know this is a place where they are welcome, where they can 
have fun and learn." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers estimated that 1,000 people would attend the daylong celebration 
that included plenty of music, salsa, folk dancing and dramatic skits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were 200 migrant farm worker families. 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly a day for children, who scampered from one event to another. 
</P>
<P>
They made miniature pinatas out of paper bags and crepe paper, and shaped bowls 
and vases from big mounds of clay. 
</P>
<P>
And once the full-size pinatas appeared, the children all seemed to gravitate 
toward the grassy clearing where the real action was. 
</P>
<P>
When a boy bashed the head off a blue Cookie Monster pinata, bedlam broke out 
as children scoured the grass for candy. 
</P>
<P>
A new "musical sculpture," made by the college's welding students, was a big 
hit with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
When a child hit the large metal sculpture with a rod, it sounded like the 
tinkling chimes in a bell tower. 
</P>
<P>
Some adults preferred to escape the heat by slipping into an air-conditioned 
building to look at an exhibit of 40 paintings by Mexican artists, sponsored by 
the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
Still others crowded around the messy soda booth where frantic volunteers were 
unable to keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
But Angee Harrold, 21, another college student, said, "It's so hot out here I 
can't stand it."

CHICANO SHOW MIXES ADVOCACY, AESTHETICS

<P>
In an epoch when polarization runs high and skins rub thin, the multi-ethnic 
Los Angeles Festival wants to nurture understanding between the diverse 
cultures on the Pacific Rim. Lurking behind this benign and healing impulse is 
the danger that the festival might fail to draw the right balance between 
ethnography and art. Too much of the one and the festival speaks only to the 
already initiated. Too little of the other and it disappoints an audience 
expecting entertainment or aesthetic delectation. 
</P>
<P>
The problem nags at the most prominent art exhibition associated with the 
festival. Titled "CARA" (an acronym for "Chicano Art: Resistance and 
Affirmation"), it opened Sunday at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery and runs to Dec. 9. 
As a measure of its ambition, it will travel to seven museums around the 
country and includes about 130 works by more than 90 artists, including many 
collaborative projects and suggesting the communal urge that inspired the 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, it is an exercise in cultural history, out to educate -- even 
indoctrinate -- its audience, first in the history and mores of a U.S. 
subculture. But, unlike the recent "The Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists 
in the United States," "CARA" tightens the focus first to Americans of Mexican 
descent, then to that faction among them who wish to be known as Chicanos and 
as part of the Chicano movement. An interpretive glossary to be included in the 
show's yet-undelivered catalogue, defines the movement as social, cultural, 
political and out to assert and regain the civil rights in a community where 
some feel they have been lost. It defines Chicano as a "self-designating term 
for politicized people of Mexican descent in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, some Mexican-Americans regard the term as a slur. According to the 
glossary virtually all terms for Latin-descended U.S. citizens from Spanish to 
Latino to Hispanic are offensive to somebody, proving there is no consensus on 
the subject. U.S. citizens who call themselves "Americans" are generally 
regarded as arrogant as the whole continent is America, north and south. 
Chicanos embrace their handle as a symbol of identification with the poor and 
disenfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
The main essay by Shifra Goldman and Tomas Ybarra-Frausto says the movement is 
centered in the Southwest. The geography is known to Chicanos as Aztlan and 
regarded as the ancestral home of the Aztecs. During the heyday of the 
movement, some Chicanos held it was plunder lost to the Anglos in the 
Mexican-American War and they wanted it back. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition traces the movement from 1965 to 1985. The essay reviews it from 
Cesar Chavez's organization of the United Farm Workers in the '60s to its 
tragic apogee in East Los Angeles during a huge 1970 anti-Vietnam War 
demonstration when newsman Ruben Salazar was killed by a tear-gas canister 
fired by a sheriff's deputy. It moves on to such cultural matters as the 
representation of Latinos in feature films like Gregory and Anna Nava's classic 
"El Norte." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of this is informative if sometimes myopically biased but it does create 
a problem that is shared by the increasingly large numbers of exhibitions that 
want to link fine art to social and political issues. There is always a 
traumatic disjuncture between the intellectual and generalizing mind-set of the 
social historian and the intensely personal and specific operation of the 
artist. Even when the artist consciously shares the intellectual's goals, his 
creative product and its scholarly rationale repel each another like magnets 
turned the wrong way. They represent irreconcilable modes of human expression. 
Art is about organic feeling which is reduced to cold ideology by advocacy 
scholarship. The Chicano art movement is not well-known to the general culture. 
In L.A. we have seen such occasional museum exhibitions as the County Museum of 
Art's "Los Four" in 1974 and commercial gallery shows that have created 
individual reputations for such artists as the late Carlos Almaraz, Gronk and 
John Valadez, among others. "CARA" creates the impression that Chicano art was 
less an organized movement than a spontaneous expression. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneity is hard to define but very convincing, as when somebody suddenly 
slugs you. That is what the real art in "CARA" does and it's a big relief after 
all the polemic. The art also bursts unexpectedly into song or plants a big 
kiss on your kisser. You feel like you've been invited into the barrio to share 
the artists' most tender and angry feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The trademark form of Chicano art is its powerful, raw murals, like the noted 
works of L.A.'s Judith Baca. They speak most clearly of a subculture struggling 
for internal cohesion and individual identity. Since murals can't be brought 
into an art gallery, they are represented, diluted, in a slide show. Other 
installations remained unfinished as vernissage festivities approached on 
Sunday, but the spirit was there. 
</P>
<P>
The very first image encountered in the galleries is a woodcut by Carlos Cortez 
Koyokuikatl, a portrait including the phrase, "Art for art's sake is an 
absurdity." About three-quarters of the work echoes that sentiment. It's out to 
be forceful, idealistic, heartfelt and funny rather than perfect. You want 
generosity? Look at Amalia Mesa-Bains' "An Ofrenda for Dolores del Rio." There 
are works echoing the artists' admiration for Mexican Surrealist Frida Kahlo 
but only one of them -- by Yreina D. Cervantes -- approaches the quality of 
Kahlo's art. Admiring memories of the great Mexican revolutionary muralists, 
Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco, are everywhere with a dollop of Posada and a 
whiff of Tamayo thrown in. Yet none of the Chicano artists display the masters' 
command of materials, heroic scale or symbolic savvy. 
</P>
<P>
The style of what we see here is that of neighborhood art. Even markedly 
professional artists like Luis Jimenez retain an aura of home-grown funk. 
Rather than taking that immediately as a shortcoming, let's look at it as a 
diagnostic symptom. It's really not unlike what we've seen coming out from the 
now-liberated Soviet underground. It's art made to express intimate feelings to 
be shared with friends and family without consideration of a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a shame to change the candor of Carmen Lomas Garza. Her gentle 
poetry is already complete in "Camas Para Suenos" where we see mother making 
the beds while the kids lounge on the roof dreaming at the moon. Gilbert 
Lujan's Pachuco dogs and Aztec-jaguar lowriders have already been ripped off as 
boutique knickknacks, proving he can't afford to get much slicker. 
</P>
<P>
"CARA" shows a complete sensibility. It's socially concerned, inbred, romantic, 
proud, nostalgic, ceremonial, masochistic, fetishistic and original. Where 
would the Anglos have been for fashion after World War II without the zoot 
suit? 
</P>
<P>
Any art judged by sensibility is of interest just as all people are of 
interest. "CARA's" collective look becomes a simile of a stay-with-the-gang 
subculture. That works among the home folks but in a larger world, it's 
different -- as proven by the growth of numerous artists here. Now they are in 
the Wight Gallery, which once housed a retrospective of Henri Matisse. That 
raises the ante just as society does when Junior moves out and has to please an 
objective boss, not just his mom and buddies. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful single body of work here are the photographs. Maybe that's 
because a demand for technical savvy is built into the medium. Ricardo 
Valverde's "Boulevard Night" doesn't lose an ounce of eloquence from being well 
composed and printed. Technique enhances the dark glamour of a barrio street 
cruise and a girl with Egyptian eyes. Photos are also ideally suited to 
exhibitions with a sociological bias, as witness the work of Harry Gamboa Jr., 
Adam Avila and others. 
</P>
<P>
Graphic art looks strong because it's learnable and a natural medium for 
propaganda. Rupert Garcia's red barbed-wire image " Cesen Deportacion!" is as 
good as any prime Cuban revolutionary poster, but his striking image of Zapata 
falls apart. It's a drawing problem around the jaw line and that's odd because 
a lot of the more cartoony work shows immense natural facility. 
</P>
<P>
To paraphrase the moribund comedian, "Dying is easy, painting is hard." More 
paintings are blown among "CARA" works than in any other medium. Daniel 
Galvez's dogged, hyperreal "Homegirl" is a triumph of expression over art. The 
tough lady stands there in her T-shirt and the image is so present it nails us 
to the wall. But no thanks to Galvez's worriful paint handling. Baca has 
similar problems in "The Three Marias." When you have to agonize too much it 
hurts the work. 
</P>
<P>
"CARA's" art rarely shows Chicano artists at their best. The exhibition proves 
that combining art and sociology is still a dicey business requiring more skill 
than was shown here. More importantly, "CARA" proves that the issue of quality 
in art will not go away. Some commentators are insisting these days that 
quality is a code word for the judgmental domination of white males. Nonsense. 
That's not what the word means. Quality has to do with every person's desire to 
get better, to express themselves with greater eloquence, force and finesse. 
The best artist in "CARA" wants to do that. So do I. So do you.

INTRODUCING YOUNGSTERS TO 'PEOPLE OF THE SNOW' RIGHT IN AN IRVINE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the kids have been clamoring for a little kilaujatut, load 'em up in the 
family komatik and head for "Igloos of Fun," the Irvine Fine Arts Center ninth 
annual Youth Art Day. But you had better leave the aiverk at home. 
</P>
<P>
If by chance you don't speak Inutitut, the language of the Inuit Eskimo, those 
exotic-sounding words mean, respectively, drum dancing, sled and walrus -- not 
exactly part of the average county schoolchild's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, the Inuit come to Irvine. Well, sort of. From 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m., children ages 3 to 10 can sample the lighter side of life among these 
hardy "people of the snow" in a day of art workshops, entertainment and games 
on the center's grounds in Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
The children's festival coincides with four Eskimo-themed exhibits on display 
at the center through April 28. They are "Inuit Games: Traditional Sport and 
Play of the Eskimo," a collection of stone-cut prints and soapstone sculpture 
by Eskimo artists that depict games of skill and endurance; artifacts of the 
Bering Sea Eskimos from Bowers Museum's permanent collection, and "The 
Grandparents of My Gloves," a retrospective by Berkeley dancer Patricia Bulitt, 
which features costumes, recordings and mixed-media remembrances of Bulitt's 
10-year cultural exchange with Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
Bulitt recently shared her experiences with teachers from the Irvine Unified 
School District. District teachers passed on the lesson to their students, who 
interpreted their studies in a series of drawings, poetry and clay sculptures 
displayed at the center's gallery. (A drawing by Culverdale School student Mike 
Jazayeri sums up the children's cross-cultural experience with a decidedly 
California flair: The Alaskan god of summer, a six-armed figure, wears 
sunglasses and clutches a hot dog, an ice cream cone and a Beach Boys album.) 
</P>
<P>
Docent tours of the exhibits will be offered through the day. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's festivities center on seven, hourlong art workshops and several 
Eskimo games that will introduce children to the culture, said Jill Stute, the 
center's special events coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"The Inuit used games as a means of developing strength and manual dexterity," 
Stute said. "Theirs was a harsh way of life, and some of their games were very 
physically taxing. The kids can see those tougher games in the exhibit, and on 
the day of the festival they'll get hands-on experience with games like Eskimo 
yo-yos and bean-bag juggling." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stute said, Dori Kirk Fitzgerald, the center's curator of 
exhibitions, will lead children in an authentic Eskimo hunting dance taught to 
her by Bullitt, and storytellers will share traditional tales of the Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's balmy weather is a far cry from the Eskimo's chilly climate, so a snow 
machine will provide a frosting of real snow on the center's lawn. The snow 
will fall at 11 a.m. Depending on the weather, it should last about an hour, 
Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
Art workshops will begin at 10 a.m. In "Magical Masks," children 6 and older 
will create masks based on Arctic animals. "Snow Prints" introduces youngsters 
to a variation on Eskimo-style block printing. In "Charms and Spells," children 
will learn how good-luck charms and magic spells helped the Eskimo succeed in 
the hunt, then create their own charms in clay. 
</P>
<P>
"Arctic Antics" is a collaborative project in which small groups will create 
clay scenes of Eskimo life, which will be fired and later displayed in the 
center's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Go Fish" will be geared for children ages 3 to 5. In it, children will learn 
about fish as a staple in the Eskimo diet, then design and decorate their own 
fish from a grab bag of art materials. In the "Drawing and Painting 
Expedition," children will hear tales of the Eskimo hunt, then depict their 
impressions in mixed media. "It's Snowing" will let young artists create snow 
by drawing Arctic scenes, then applying a solution of epsom salts that form 
snowlike crystals on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Two drop-in workshops -- "Arctic Mural," in which youngsters will contrast 
their life style with the Eskimo's on two large murals, and "Build Your Own 
Igloo," a construction project of fair-weather igloos of cardboard and paint -- 
will be offered throughout the day. Face-painting will also be available for a 
small fee. 
</P>
<P>
In the center's courtyard, such local entertainers as the Lori Hansen Dancers, 
the Rainbow Singers and Sky Badger, an American Indian who tells folk stories, 
will be presented. Food will be sold from 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Art day will be Saturday at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, 14321 Yale Ave. 
in Irvine's Heritage Park. Attendance is open to the entire family. Children 
under 6 must be accompanied by an adult. Walk-in registration will begin at 9 
a.m. Registration fee is $9 per child and includes two 1-hour workshops, both 
drop-in workshops and all entertainment and games. Adults are free.

TIM HAWKINSON -- MANIPULATING EVERYDAY OBJECTS AND NOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American penny becomes a cobra snake with a long thin mass of copper 
stretched between the coin's "head" and "tail"; a nurse's cap becomes a 
mother's breast complete with a nipple sculpted from human hair; a crucifix 
becomes an old-fashioned scale, with the weights consisting of two bags of gold 
resembling figures in mourning; and an American flag becomes a literal 
black-and-white, stars-and-stripes image with the stars coming from a 
photograph of the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the works of mixed-media artist Tim Hawkinson, who manipulates 
everyday objects and the notions we hold about them to create a diverse body of 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the work comes from an investigation of social and personal views of 
the objects," said Hawkinson, who has a one-person show at Wilshire Boulevard's 
Ace Gallery through Saturday, and will be included in a three-person show 
opening at Santa Monica's Michael Kohn Gallery on Thursday (through Aug. 25). 
"There's just this kind of general urge to corrupt everyday objects that we 
find." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkinson, 29, works in a variety of mediums and says that he has no special 
trick to coming up with the diverse ideas. "I just use whatever medium is most 
suited to the ideas, but the ideas always come first" the soft-spoken, clean 
cut Hawkinson said, noting that he must sometimes "invent" objects to use as 
materials for his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hawkinson's pieces are romantic, such as a manipulated lunar calendar 
made of a 10-foot-long pearl necklace. Some refer directly to already existing 
artworks, such as the copy of Simone Martini's famous "Annunciation" painting 
that Hawkinson put onto an envelope so that the cancellation stamps became 
halos around the deities' heads. 
</P>
<P>
And still others are based on his own body. Three recent "self portraits," for 
instance, include a photographic collage of "the area I can not see in the 
periphery of my body," a cast lead sculpture of "the maximum mass I could get 
into my mouth," and a sculpture of the artist's legs where "the height of the 
sculpture was determined by (the amount of lead needed to equal) my body 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
But most of Hawkinson's pieces stand on their own, unrelated to other work he 
has done. An example seem during a recent trip to the artist's downtown studio 
-- which he shares with his painter wife Patty Wickman -- was a rather pretty 
rose window composed of medical slides from the pap smears of 300 women. The 
piece, Hawkinson explained, shows "the relationship of the (pap smears) to the 
history of the church and religion: There are two ways of seeing things, 
through the window and through the microscope." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkinson, who normally works on a number of pieces at one time, says he likes 
to keep variety in his work, which has "remained consistently inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
"I've avoided the idea of working in any kind of a series format," he says, 
noting that the variety helps him avoid falling into a formula and keeps his 
work more honest. "I'm much more interested in the ideas themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The visual arts category accounted for $403,862 of the more than $3 million 
awarded last week in cultural grants through the Los Angeles Endowment for the

<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue's Cure Gallery is making its own contribution to the debate over 
"obscene" artworks and National Endowment for the Arts funding. Included in the 
gallery's current three-man show, called "Collaborative Views," is South 
Pasadena-based artist Theodore's 72-by-48-inch texturized acrylic painting 
depicting a large, erect penis. The work's title: "What Does Jesse (Helms) 
Want?" Also included in the show is Studio City-based artist Steve Montiglio's 
oil painting, "Helms Deep," which features two intermingled nude females. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first two weeks of September, cancel everything; just drop it now!" 
began L.A. Festival director Peter Sellars as he addressed an enthusiastic 
crowd of more than 100 members of the Fellows of Contemporary Art at its recent 
new members party. 
</P>
<P>
While Sellars' Pacific-themed festival doesn't officially begin until Sept. 1, 
the first two of the more than 25 visual art exhibitions included under its 
banner open this week. "Images of Faith: Religious Ivory Carvings From the 
Philippines" opens at Pacific Asia Museum today, and "Tongues of Flame," the 
first comprehensive exhibition of works by controversial New York artist David 
Wojnarowicz, goes on view Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three emerging L.A. artists are hoping to make a go of it with a new art space 
opening up today in the downtown Santa Fe Artists Colony. Alan Blizzard, 
Richard Gerrish and Heidi Von Kann have joined together to form Millenium, 
which they have committed to run for one year and would like to open up to both 
visual and performance artists if adequate financial support can be found. 
</P>
<P>
As its first event, Millenium (at 2401 S. Santa Fe Ave., Studio 22) is holding 
a special $100-per-couple opening today from 2-5 p.m. to benefit the charity 
Vital Options. RSVP: (213) 587-5902.

"I probably have stuff around my house that would fit in this room," said a 
middle-aged woman in a black-and-green pantsuit as she glanced at the 
"funny-looking teapot" and other works in the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art's 20th-Century Ceramics room during one of the museum's special 25th 
Anniversary Member's Evenings. 
</P>

<P>
When Los Angeles artist Francesco Siqueiros visited colleagues in Mexico City, 
he discovered something exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taken by their group projects and by the discussions they held every 
week," Siqueiros says. "It was stimulating talking about art issues." 
</P>
<P>
He was so moved by their group sharing and cooperation that he wanted to tell 
the world about it. Or at least Southern California. "How could I bring these 
artists to Los Angeles?" he asked himself. 
</P>
<P>
Siqueiros pictured the two art communities meeting each other and opening the 
lines of communication through an exhibition and art workshop. He proposed the 
idea to Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in 1988 but he says he "got a lot 
of bureaucratic run-around from them. They didn't know what to do with this 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than putting together a show just for viewing. I wanted something 
with the intellectual friction and historical tension that exists between the 
two countries," Siqueiros says. 
</P>
<P>
Mentioning his idea to friends at a party, Siqueiros was told to go to Edward 
Leffingwell, then the new director at Barnsdall's Municipal Art Gallery in 
Hollywood. Leffingwell, Siqueiros learned, had been exploring a similar idea. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was Siqueiros' vision of getting together onto the same stage Mexican 
as well as Mexican-American artists that won Leffingwell's interest. He 
extended the city's support through the auspices of the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, with additional financing from the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
What Siqueiros and Leffingwell, along with co-curator Gabriela Cortines, have 
assembled is Aqui y Alla (translation: Here and Over There), an exhibition of 
contemporary works by Nahum Zenil, Diego Toledo, Eloy Tarcisio, Ruben Rosas, 
Mario Rangel Faz, Ruben Ortiz Torres, Monica Castillo of Mexico City and Victor 
Estrada, Yreina Cervantez, Anthony Zepeda, Margaret Garcia, John Valadez, Frank 
Romero and Patssi Valdez of Los Angeles. The exhibit will run through Nov. 4 at 
the Barnsdall Park Arts Center. In addition, the artists will meet this month 
and next in several panel discussions on contemporary Chicano art. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will also be shown in Tijuana and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Leffingwell promises that the exhibit "will be about ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Like those of Patssi Valdez of East L.A., a painter who now deals extensively 
with on-site installations. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work with chance," she says. "Life is chance. We never know what's 
going to come in life." 
</P>
<P>
Chance is not an element of Yreina Cervantez's art. The daughter of farm 
workers, she paints images of her inner pain and conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"My work uses personal symbolism and cultural symbolism," the Los Angeles 
artist says, "but it gets back to identity, which is so important. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be open up to our experiences. We're all very different, but there 
are basic truths. Art manifests changes in the community. As artists, we have 
responsibilities. We are visionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Facing the past and placing it into perspective, as Cervantez has done on a 
personal level, is what the Chicano art movement is about, she says. 
</P>
<P>
However, Victor Estrada of Los Angeles warns against any temptation to 
categorize the Chicano art movement as solely political. To do so, he says, 
implies that Chicano artists cannot do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to the ability to express one's self? The social issues are going 
to come out in the work anyway," he says defending his abstract style. "Some 
artists make their art specific, and in other's the issues just come out. 
</P>
<P>
"The more room there is for difference, the greater power art has. If you try 
to control culture, it's another form of facism. Artistically, people have to 
assume their right to exist. Freedom is not given, it's taken." 
</P>
<P>
But master printer Anthony Zepeda of Los Angeles says he could never be 
political with his work. 
</P>
<P>
"My art is more like poetry," he says. "It's the only way I know how to express 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda says he views the Aqui y Alla exhibition as an expression of ethnic and 
artistic pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in this particular show because I want my father to come see 
it," he says of his father who migrated to the United States in 1905 during the 
Mexican Revolution. "He's essentially more Mexican than me. I want him to be 
happy that it's happening."

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: PAIR OF TIJUANA SHOWS TOO NARROW IN VISION

<P>
San Diego hardly deserves the epithet of a sleepy border town, but in terms of 
recognizing artists living just on the other side of the line, this city has 
slumbered long and deep. 
</P>
<P>
Like the country at large, however, the city awoke with a start last year and 
began to make up for lost time. Regular exhibitions of Mexican art have shown 
at the Iturralde Gallery (formerly La Casa del Arte), and the La Jolla Museum 
of Contemporary Art organized a show of Tijuana artists for its downtown space, 
Sushi gallery played host to two shows of Tijuana artists, and an exhibition of 
contemporary Mexican art has been seen at Mesa and Palomar colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Each had its share of compelling work, and each introduced a local audience to 
currents of activity that had not passed through San Diego with such vigor 
before. None, however, claimed to be a comprehensive survey of its territory, 
and viewers were left to wonder what else may have been overlooked while the 
city's attention to the south lay dormant. 
</P>
<P>
Two current shows at the Centro Cultural Tijuana (Paseo de los Heroes, Tijuana) 
address that curiosity by presenting the work of more than 40 artists living in 
Tijuana -- all of the "serious" artists there, according to a representative of 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
One show, "Elogio a Tijuana," delivers a eulogy, or declaration of praise, for 
the city through a survey of its artists. The other, "Grupo Centenario," 
presents work made specifically in honor of the city's centennial this year by 
10 artists working loosely as a collective. 
</P>
<P>
Both shows contain work that is broad in range but overall narrow in vision. 
Except for a handful of engaging paintings, the shows threaten to lull even the 
most eager visitor back into the sleepy ignorance that characterized our 
southward gaze for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana's own dynamic growth, its status as a thoroughfare for immigrants 
heading north, its extremes of wealth and poverty and numerous facets of its 
history would seem to be fertile subjects for the artists in the "Grupo 
Centenario" show. Most, however, adopt a static, shallow approach to their 
theme, representing the city through images of its architectural landmarks 
nestled within decorative compositions. 
</P>
<P>
The bland tone of these works is broken only briefly, by the thoughtful work of 
Manolo Luis Escutia and a collage by Alejandro Chanona. An Escutia triptych 
pays homage to the anonymous women who work in maquiladoras; in another work, 
he visualizes the city's history as a montage of human and material products, 
both bearing strong imprints of American influence. 
</P>
<P>
In "Las Cien Tes" ("One Hundred Ts"), Escutia examines the letter T, finding 
its vertical and horizontal lines to be symbols of hope and frustration and, 
together, an appropriate emblem for the city of Tijuana. He repeats the letter 
on 100 sheets of paper, forming each with a different pattern or image that 
represents an aspect of the city. This approach, with its political, 
agricultural and cultural references, encourages a multifaceted reading of the 
city, not one limited to its physical appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Chanona's collage, "T. J. Cien Anos" ("T.J. 100 Years"), also provokes thought 
about the city's character and the challenges it faces. All but one corner of 
the collage is smothered by a dense patchwork of clothing tags, references to 
Tijuana's status as a haven for American bargain hunters. In the one quiet 
corner, only two labels appear. One bears the words One Way and an arrow 
pointing up to the jumble of tags, and the other advertises a "Total Selloff," 
to which the artist has added the emblem of the Mexican flag and the words T.J. 
100 Anos. 
</P>
<P>
Through this small intervention, Chanona expresses a sharp note of concern 
about the Americanization and exploitation of Tijuana. In the accompanying wall 
label, he shares his cynical hope that in 100 years, when the city celebrates 
its bicentennial, people will still be speaking Spanish and eating tacos. 
</P>
<P>
The adjacent exhibition, "Elogio a Tijuana," is crowded with weak, facile 
imagery, forced enigmas and failed fantasies. Only a few of the artists 
included manage to convey a strong personal vision or style. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Almada's "El Jaguar," for instance, a simple yet bold rendering of a 
jaguar being struck down by an anonymous, all-powerful hand, evokes a narrative 
of mythic proportion. In an untitled photograph by Ana Maria Herrera, a 
sculpture of a male torso stands amid the deep shadows of an abandoned 
building. The surrogate human presence exudes a mystery and surreal magnetism 
akin to the subjects of Mexico's photographic patriarch, Manuel Alvarez Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
The soul of the show is not to be found in these scattered impressions, 
however, but in the grouping of 2 dozen paintings by Benjamin Serrano Banuet, 
who died last year. The exhibition begins with his relatively staid, 
environmental portraits of a prominent Tijuana family, then jumps abruptly to a 
whimsical self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the artist playfully pinches the conventions of dignified portraiture 
that rule the preceding paintings by appearing shirtless, wearing a folded 
paper hat and false nose, and playing a violin to an oversized green apple. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano was a prolific artist whose paintings, prints and sculptural 
assemblages embody the wisdom of dreams and the whimsical spirit of games. 
Though this selection of his works is spotty and includes none of his 
brilliantly funny sculptures, it does hint at the richness of his personal 
vocabulary. Impossible flying contraptions sputter about among turtles with 
wings, fish with human heads, people with paper-doll tabs and women ripe with 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the artists in "Elogio a Tijuana" emulate Serrano's spree through 
the realms of fantasy and dreams, but none matches his passion and wit. 
</P>
<P>
"Elogio a Tijuana" was organized by the Centro's new director, Pedro Ochoa 
Palacio, to mark the first visit by the director of the Consejo Nacional para 
la Cultura y las Artes. Both shows continue at the center through Aug. 14.

<DESCRIPT>  MUSEUM; STORE; PRODUCT; SALE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT'S difficult to be a bohemian, free-spirit, artsy type at Christmas.;  
After all, you know that the true spirit of the season does not lie in the
exchange of gifts, but in the exchange of souls and hand-made batiks that you
should have started making in June if you were going to have enough for all of
the cousins.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Fantasy Gifts; Fantasy art  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That's right, you're going to hand out presents of the temporal kind this
year, even though it is disturbing to think of yourself as a mere consumer.
You could be making this world a more beautiful place. Instead, you'll be
standing in line at Target.;   But there is a compromise: the museum store,
those shops that not only have unusual, art-related gifts, but help support a
cultural institution. What a deal: you get great gifts and none of the guilt.;
  You also can combine shopping with pleasure if you give yourself enough time
to visit the galleries. However, museums will allow you to visit their stores
without paying the admission fees for the galleries if you tell the guards
you're just there for the shopping.;   Here's a guide to some of the best and
biggest museum shops:;   (star) San Jose Museum of Art Book &amp; Gift Shop, 110
S. Market St., San Jose. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday; 10 a.m.-8 p.m.
Tuesday-Friday; 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday; and noon-6 p.m. Sunday. through Dec.
23. (408) 294-2787. Sometimes it's difficult for San Jose to rise above
feelings of inferiority when it comes to our neighbor to the north. After all,
most of San Francisco's cultural institutions have a jump of several decades
on our own. However, when it comes to museum stores, San Jose bows to no one.;
  The shop, located in the older part of the museum and with its own entrance
on Market Street, is bustling. The museum shop has a nice selection of art
books, calendars, cards and jewelry, but its strength might be its birdhouses.
The store carries two kinds. The hand-carved bird abodes of Barry Leader are
bright and whimsical. There's even one fashioned like the head of a cat,
presumably for your less intelligent avian life. Prices range from $120 to
$140.;   For those with smaller budgets, there are the birdhouses of Fred Van
Anda. They're rustic, made from used wood and bits of tin. They sell for $78.;
  (star) Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum Shop, 1342 Naglee Ave., San Jose. Open 9
a.m.-5 p.m. daily. (408) 287-9171. The place to go for that Egyptologist on
your list. The Rosicrucian shop carries items ranging in price from slides of
the museum (38 cents) to golden statues of Egyptian gods (up to $100). The
more popular gods are also featured on their own T-shirts, which are $15. The
shop also has books on ancient Egypt, including some for children, such as
"How to Make a Mummy.";   (star) Triton Museum of Art Collector's Gallery,
1505 Warburton Ave., Santa Clara. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday and until
9 p.m. Tuesday; noon-5 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. (408) 247-3754. The Triton's
store is rather small, and opts to spend its space on more objets d'art than
books and cards. The Triton has a surprising collection of African objects,
including a Somali milking container for $98 and a leather shield from the
Masai tribe for $68. There is also a selection of jewelry, including sterling
silver pins in the shape of fish skeletons for $50.;   (star) American Museum
of Quilts and Textiles, 776 S. 2nd St., San Jose. Open 10 a.m.-4 p.m.
Tuesday-Saturday. (408) 971-0323. It's the place to go if you like quilts and
textiles. For the specialist there are such titles as "The Button Lover's
Book" and "America's Glorious Quilts." But there are also quilted Christmas
tree ornaments ($3.50) and quilted Christmas stockings ($20). The American
Museum of Quilts and Textiles also wins the award for homiest store. Get there
at lunchtime and you can hear the volunteers in the kitchen stirring up
something hot.;   (star) San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Books, 401 Van
Ness Ave., San Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Friday and until 9 p.m.
Thursday; 11 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. (415) 252-4035. As the name
implies, the Museum of Modern Art has books. Lots of books. Books about every
artist who's got a book, even unknown artists. Take "Thrift Store Paintings --
Paintings Found in Thrift Stores" ($45), which features works titled "Ochre
Baby Crawls on Man's Chest as Dog Looks On" and "Woman Made of Pillow, Wax
Lips, Green Thing." It's irresistible stuff.;   The museum also has a large
selection of children's books, including the "Art for Children" series that
attempts to get kids interested early. Somehow it seems unlikely that your
10-year-old nephew will be ecstatic with the ambitious-sounding "Diego
Rodriguez de Silva y Velasquez Art for Children," but what the heck. He'll
thank you in a decade or two.;   Also notable is the jewelry selection, which
is the best around if your tastes run to modern art. Prices range widely --
from a few dollars to thousands.;   (star) Mexican Museum La Tienda, Fort
Mason Center, San Francisco. Open noon to 6 p.m. daily through Dec. 24. (415)
441-0445. The Mexican Museum buys from 14 different importers to get goods
from all over Mexico. Right now, La Tienda is stocked with lots of tin
Christmas tree ornaments ($2.50-$12) along with the pottery, masks and
paper-mache figures that normally fill the room. Prices range from a few cents
for a tiny clay bird to $550 for an enormous copper pot.;   (star) M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum Store, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Palace of the
Legion of Honor Store, Lincoln Park, San Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m.
daily. (415) 750-3600. The shops of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco
share a lot of the same merchandise. They're where you can get replicas of
Degas' dancer in a substance called "Alvastone" ($85) and limited edition
plaques from Holland ($475).;   But there are also silk scarves of Frank Lloyd
Wright's "Tree of Life" pattern ($35) and museum T-shirts ($15). There are
even stocking stuffer bookmarks (50 cents).;   The de Young store is
significantly larger than the tiny Palace of the Legion of Honor store. And
now the Fine Arts Museums have an outlet on the fifth floor of Macy's on Union
Square.;   (star) California Academy of Sciences Store, Golden Gate Park, San
Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. (415) 221-5100. This store is a little
hard to find, but it's worth it. Ask for directions. The Academy Store has a
wide selection for both children and adults. We'll start with the adults.;  
There's an amethyst necklace from Uruguay ($265), woodcuts of California
wildlife by Jim and Lisa Pesl ($65 unframed), hand-painted safari plates from
Italy decorated with zebras, tigers, giraffes and jungle plants ($25 for
dinner plates, $22.50 for salad plates) and a wooden model of a spotted
sturgeon ($17.95).;   For kids, there are plush hand puppets you probably
won't find many other places. Along with the more cuddly animals, the puppets
include crabs, bats and octopuses ($12.95-$15.95). You can buy Catgrass Seed
and grow snacks for your cats ($9), or pick up an Astronaut Ice Cream Sandwich
("Ready to eat! Freeze Dried!! Will not melt!!!" $2). And then there's the
Butterfly Garden, with packaging that says it's fun and educational, and adds,
"Mail the enclosed free coupon for your caterpillars!" Oh boy.;   (star) The
San Francisco Opera Shop, 199 Grove St., San Francisco. Open 11 a.m.-5 p.m.
Monday; 11 a.m.-curtain Tuesday-Friday; noon-curtain Saturday. (415) 565-6414.
It's not in a museum, but the San Francisco Opera has its own store, stocked
with merchandise you might more frequently find imprinted with "San Francisco
Giants" than "San Francisco Opera." There are opera T-shirts (most $14.95),
opera baby bibs ($4.95) and opera suspenders ($25).;   There are also opera
recordings. Hundreds of them. And there's that chocolate candy from Austria,
Mozart Kugeln, of course.;   (star) The San Francisco Ballet Shop, 455
Franklin St., San Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday-Friday. (415)
861-5600. This shop is for the serious dancer. The "Nutcracker" souvenirs are
sold at performances in the War Memorial Opera House.;   The ballet shop, on
the other hand, carries shoes and leotards -- and the heating pads, hot wraps
and cold wraps that convince shoppers ballet is not for the squeamish.;   But
there are also a few more general items, like a San Francisco Ballet water
bottle ($6.95) and San Francisco Ballet sweat shirts ($38 and $48). (box)  </TEXT>

POET WRITES 2ND NOVEL 20 YEARS AFTER A PULITZER;

BOOKS: IN 'THE ANCIENT CHILD,' KIOWA AUTHOR N. SCOTT MOMADAY USES DREAMS AND 
VISIONS TO FIND PATHWAYS TO BLOOD ANCESTRY AND RACIAL MEMORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1969, the year man took his first steps on the moon, a young Kiowa poet 
named N. Scott Momaday stunned the literary world when he was awarded the 
Pulitzer Prize for a novel called "House Made of Dawn." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday, then an English professor at UC Santa Barbara, was so shocked he 
thought someone was playing a joke on him. His own publisher couldn't recall 
the obscure book. 
</P>
<P>
But some American Indians weren't too surprised. They knew the poet was 
destined for glory. His last name in the Kiowa language, Mammedate, means 
Skywalker, or One Who Walks Above. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, Momaday has written a second novel, "The Ancient Child" 
(published Oct. 25 by Doubleday), about the spiritual journey of an American 
Indian artist exploring his heritage and the mythology of his people. 
</P>
<P>
The early reviews have praised the book as a dazzling new work. And demand for 
the literary novel has been surprisingly high, considering the author has been 
out of the national spotlight. "The Ancient Child" is already in its third 
printing with more than 20,000 copies published. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the sales -- we can't go back to the printer fast 
enough," said Lisa Eskow, publicist for Doubleday. "We expect the book to 
continue selling quite strongly." 
</P>
<P>
Why has the 55-year-old Momaday, an important voice in American letters, been 
silent for so long? "I don't think of myself as a novelist. I'm a poet," said 
Momaday, relaxing in the living room of his large adobe house during a break in 
his book promotional tour. "It's been 20 years since I wrote 'House Made of 
Dawn,' and I think of it as an aberration. I still feel poetry is the highest 
form of literature." 
</P>
<P>
After his dazzling debut, Momaday wrote two books of poetry and two memoirs. 
None won the same widespread praise nor attention as "House Made of Dawn." 
Momaday admitted he struggled to match the artistic power of his first work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a state of disbelief when I heard about the Pulitzer," said Momaday. 
"It also put extra pressure on me. I had a hard time getting on with the next 
book. What could I have possibly done that would have topped it?" 
</P>
<P>
Most critics wrote highly of "House Made of Dawn." Although he thought the 
novel's narrative was flawed, Baine Kerr in the Southwest Review called it "a 
brave book" in which Momaday "mythicized Indian consciousness into a modern 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
Others condescended to it, suggesting that the fiery politics of the '60s 
swayed the Pulitzer Prize judges to select a nonwhite author. In the New York 
Times Book Review, John Leonard wrote that Momaday's book was honored because 
it was a "safe" choice, "a pet instead of a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's friends scoff at the criticism his early work received. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott was obviously a person of great capacity and promise," said novelist 
Wallace Stegner, who taught Momaday in the 1960s when the poet was a 
creative-writing fellow at Stanford University. "It was clear he could more 
than hold his own among any writers -- minority or non-minority." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday believes the poor reviews and doubts about his novel's artistry arose 
from an ignorance of his American Indian background, a mystical culture of 
animal spirits, gourd dances and creation rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the reviews were perceptive and responsible; some were not," said 
Momaday. " 'House Made of Dawn' must have been very difficult to understand for 
writers from a more privileged experience. The Indian world is one of which 
most people know nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Like authors from James Joyce to Ralph Ellison, Momaday wrestles with questions 
of language, identity and racial ancestry in a civilization that seems to 
destroy cultural tradition rather than preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
His themes from old Indian tales and his haunting lyrical style reflect the 
cadences of Kiowa and Navajo prayers and chants. His dreamy stories and 
characters jump back and forth across time. 
</P>
<P>
Some feel Momaday's strongest writing is not in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 
novel, but in his memoirs, "The Way to Rainy Mountain" (1969) and "The Names" 
(1976). In those meditative works, Momaday makes a pilgrimage to the Devil's 
Tower rock in Wyoming, a great landmark in Kiowa myth. 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's new novel continues his journey across a magical landscape. Its hero, 
an Indian artist named Set, discovers he is the reincarnation of a Kiowa child 
of legend who turns into a bear. The bear chases seven sisters and a brother up 
Devil's Tower, but the siblings escape into the sky, forming the stars of the 
Big Dipper. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's an unusual novel -- much different from 'House Made of Dawn,' " said 
Momaday. "It's a love story, a mythic tale. . . . It even has dime novel 
elements. And it has the old, old idea of a man searching for his identity." 
</P>
<P>
"The Ancient Child" is a largely autobiographical novel. Like Set, his 
character, Momaday is a painter who has had shows in several galleries in the 
Southwest ("I didn't make Set a brain surgeon for a reason," said Momaday, 
laughing). Like Set, Momaday believes that dreams and visions are pathways to 
one's blood ancestry and racial memory. And like Set, Momaday believes the 
violent power of the "bear spirit" dwells inside him. 
</P>
<P>
"With certain animals in the Indian cosmology, you can acquire power and 
benefit from knowing them," said Momaday. "But the bear is hostile, a 
confrontation that can only be expressed as a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Usually the bear is dormant, said Momaday. But it often surfaces in bursts of 
anger and destructiveness, he said. Or it may flood him with a new artistic 
vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Animal spirits aside, Momaday and his publisher are pushing "The Ancient Child" 
as a quintessential American work. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine it being written in any other country," he said. "No other 
country has Indians, Wild West legends, Western landscapes . . ."

Momaday's red adobe home is pure Americana. It squats amid sagebrush and cacti 
in a gently rolling desert area of Tucson, a short drive from the University of 
Arizona where Momaday teaches classes in literature and oral tradition. 
</P>
<P>
His cream-colored Airedale, Sabadotarde (Saturday afternoon) gallops across the 
tiled floor to greet visitors. Momaday is a tall man with slow, graceful 
movements. He wears jeans and a black shirt like Marlon Brando to hide his 
large belly. 
</P>
<P>
"Make me look a lot lighter," he said, joking with a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
The living room and den resemble a private gallery of Indian and Western 
artifacts and Momaday's own etchings and paintings. On one wall hangs an old 
Apache shield made of dried horsehide, human hair and a yellowed bear tooth. It 
looks dull and faded. 
</P>
<P>
"These things are full of power," said Momaday. "I think of them as personal 
flags, coats of armor belonging to one man, representing one man, and he must 
be true to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I hold onto these things because I'm a writer, and the imagination 
and the culture are so important to me," he said. "Somehow, I manage to keep 
one foot in those worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's facial features are clearly American Indian. But his deep, resonant 
voice -- sounding theatrical and Anglo upper-crust -- clashes with his 
appearance. He and his German wife, Regina Heitzer, have a 9-year-old daughter, 
Lore. 
</P>
<P>
"This bicultural identity came naturally to me," he said, sipping a soda water. 
"I was born into two cultures and brought up in two. I learned to exist in both 
worlds fairly early. Even though, at times, I was the only Indian in school, I 
was proud of my identity. And I got into a lot of fights with kids because of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
His father, a full-blooded Kiowa, and his mother, part-Cherokee, were 
educators, artists and writers who taught their son about the gifts of language 
and culture -- white and Indian. The family lived on and off Navajo and Kiowa 
reservations in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Momaday attended reservation 
and Catholic schools and then college at the now-defunct Augusta Military 
Academy in Virginia. The student Momaday was well-prepared when he arrived at 
Stanford in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
People soon noticed the young writer from New Mexico. The late critic and poet 
Yvor Winters took Momaday under his wing. Francis McCullough, a classmate and 
editor of the school's literary journal, The Sequoia, would later publish 
Momaday's first novel as an editor of Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Momaday's supporters believe his writing and celebration of the Indian 
oral tradition is a beacon to Anglo writers and readers lost in a soulless 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with most Americans is we don't speak from within a tradition; we 
all speak from outside and try to trample tradition," said novelist Stegner, 
who lives in the Los Altos Hills near Stanford. "Scott has managed to find a 
mythological foundation for his writing, and it's served him well." 
</P>
<P>
In the world according to Momaday, his life reflects his art over and over, 
like the seasons. Each summer, he tries to make it to Oklahoma City to join the 
few living Kiowa for the gourd dance, the tribe's celebration of creation and 
mythology. 
</P>
<P>
"When the drums start rolling and the eagle-feather fan is in my hand, it's as 
if I'm going back 200, 300 years, and my father and grandfather and 
great-grandfather are dancing next to me," said Momaday. "It takes hold of you. 
It's intense and mystical, a kind of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense I am where I ought to be, and where I have always been."

SOVIET FESTIVAL ASIDE, S. D. WILL OFFER DIVERSITY IN '89

With or without a mayoral proclamation, 1989 is shaping up to be a bountiful 
year for the visual arts in San Diego. The Soviet Arts Festival, scheduled for 
October and November, will undoubtedly get the heaviest dose of hype of any 
local art event this year. In terms of visual art offerings, however, the 
festival promises to be mostly bark and very little bite. 
</P>
<P>
The rich and diverse programming that has quietly slipped onto the books of 
local museums and galleries for the year attests to both the city's potential 
and its accomplishment much more convincingly than any of the spectacles 
planned by the mayor. Exhibitions organized by major institutions across the 
country will be stopping in San Diego for a spell this year and, more 
important, local art museums will be spreading their wealth as well. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art continues to lead the pack in this 
regard, this year initiating two touring exhibitions, beginning with the first 
comprehensive museum retrospective of the work of Vernon Fisher, a Texas-based 
artist known for his complex and often obtuse narrative works. After its La 
Jolla debut (Feb. 3-April 2), the show will travel to the Albright-Knox Gallery 
in Buffalo, New York, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston and other 
distinguished venues. Later in the year, the museum will exhibit the work of 
designer Emilio Ambasz (June 9-Aug. 6). The show will explore Ambasz's 
contribution to architecture, industrial design and graphic arts, and will also 
be seen in Montreal and several other American cities. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art, hardly a vigorous exporter of its creative 
products, will travel only one of its exhibitions this year, a retrospective of 
the Spanish Impressionist painter, Joaquin Sorolla (Sept. 16-Oct. 28), 
co-organized with the Institute of Modern Art in Valencia. The museum's 
schedule for the year, however, does reflect a more adventurous importing 
policy than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Its show, "Art For the Public: New Collaborations" (March 1-April 9), from the 
Dayton Art Institute, offers an educational perspective on the highly 
provocative arena of public art, through plans and models of seven projects 
throughout the country. The Bronx Museum of the Arts will be sending "Latin 
American Presence in the United States, 1920-1970" (May 22-July 16), which 
focuses on how the U.S. has acted as "stimulus, source, haven, receptor or 
locus" in the work of artists from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's sporadic steps into contemporary art and art linked to other 
cultures touch on firmer ground this year with these two shows as well as an 
exhibition featuring the paintings of Li Huai. Trained in Beijing and now 
living in San Diego, Huai explores the experience of working in such disparate 
milieus in her show, "An Artist in Two Cultures" (June 10-July 23). 
</P>
<P>
With the demise of most of the city's serious contemporary galleries in the 
past few years, local artists have seen their home-based opportunities dwindle. 
Of the galleries that remain (or have newly opened), only the Dietrich Jenny 
Gallery maintains a strong and consistent commitment to local artists. This 
year the gallery will show work by Steven Criqui and Michael Cuddington (Jan. 
5-Feb. 4), Amanda Farber (Feb. 9-March 11), Ernest Silva (April 20-May 20) and 
Wick Alexander (May 25-June 24). 
</P>
<P>
Local artists will have a chance to respond directly to one another's work in 
Installation Gallery's new "Hothouse" program. Each month, a different artist 
will make his or her mark on an appointed section of the gallery, modifying the 
work of the previous month's creator and setting the stage for the next. The 
gallery will also spotlight the downtown art scene once again with its annual 
Artwalk (April 22-23), a weekend of open studios, galleries and special 
exhibitions. Sushi Gallery's annual "Streetseries" presentation of art in 
public spaces (Feb.10-March 11) promises to ignite the city as well, in its own 
surreptitious and subversive ways. 
</P>
<P>
Other stimulating experiences in store for the year include the "Rosenberg Era 
Art Project," a traveling show of historic and contemporary work along the 
themes of patriotism and the Rosenberg trial itself (at Installation and the La 
Jolla Museum Downtown, Sept. 8-Oct. 21), the Thomas Babeor Gallery's exhibition 
of work by the elusive Surrealist Joseph Cornell (March 17-April 16), and the 
San Diego State University Art Gallery's sponsorship of a site-specific 
collaboration by New York artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler (April 21-May 
24). 
</P>
<P>
While the mayor's decision to bypass the city's natural links to Latino culture 
and concentrate its first international arts festival instead on the remote 
expressions of the Soviet Union generated a measurable amount of flak, that 
bond will not go unexplored this year. In addition to the SDMA's "Latin 
American Presence" exhibition, three promising shows are scheduled at four 
different venues. "Young Mexican Painters" will be shared between the Mesa 
College Art Gallery and Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (March 17-April 27), 
and will be accompanied by a symposium on Mexican and Chicano art. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi Gallery will organize a show of work by Hispanic women from Tijuana and 
San Diego (March 17-April 15), and the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which faces 
the challenge this year of sustaining its momentum through a change in 
leadership, will present a show of photographs by Latina women that was curated 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
If the efforts of a consortium of contemporary art venues -- LJMCA, UC San 
Diego's Mandeville Gallery, SDSU's Art Gallery, Installation, the Centro and 
Sushi -- materialize, a group of Soviet artists will be brought to San Diego as 
artists-in-residence in the fall. Then, perhaps, the Soviet Arts Festival will 
elicit as much vitality and energy as the city's arts institutions strive for 
all year, every year.

LAGUNA EXHIBIT OF COUPLE'S WORKS SHOWS EXPRESSIONS OF 2 SINGULAR IMAGINATIONS 
</P>

<P>
In this rushed era of information overload, pop psychology and the ubiquitous 
sound bite, we are used to getting a handle on people by using ready-made 
categories -- yuppie, conservative, ethnic. 
</P>
<P>
In the infinitely subtle and highly personal world of art, however, labels are 
not much help. You don't get a grip on someone's work if all you know is that 
he or she is a conceptual artist or a Neo-Expressionist -- or a female or a 
black or a Latino artist. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, trying to come to terms with work by an "ethnic" artist has all sorts 
of pitfalls for the unwary. Using the ethnic label to stress the artist's 
"otherness," you may seem to imply that this person needs to be shielded from 
comparison with "mainstream" (i.e., male or white) artists. You may also be 
ignoring the delicate balance between "nature" and "nurture" in an artist's 
life. What if he or she was born into one culture but educated by another? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you emphasize the artist's ties to the broader art 
community, you risk misunderstanding the heart and soul of the work -- 
including the conflict and isolation that often deeply color the lives of 
minority members of a society. 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts arise on the occasion of an exhibition of paintings by Carlos 
Almaraz and Elsa Flores, who are husband and wife, that runs through Nov. 7 at 
the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach. Almaraz, a leading 
member of the Southern California Latino art community, is a painter of 
phantasmagoric figurative scenes and landscapes alive with riotous color and 
light. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Mexico City in 1941 and grew up in Chicago and Southern 
California, where -- after living briefly in a rural Mexican-American village 
and in upscale West Los Angeles -- his parents eventually settled in the East 
Los Angeles barrio. His father, a laborer, was a fan of such American writers 
as Jack London and John Steinbeck. 
</P>
<P>
After studying life drawing in high school and attending several colleges, 
Almaraz moved to New York to check out the art scene. Unfortunately for his 
painterly exuberance, Minimalism was the style of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1971, at age 30, Almaraz returned to Los Angeles. After recovering from a 
severe illness and depression, he went back to the other side -- the culture of 
his heritage. With great gusto he entered the loop of Chicano artists, actors 
and social activists. He painted murals celebrating Chicano culture. He showed 
his work as a member of the proudly ethnic-identified Los Four group. 
</P>
<P>
But he also finally finished up his studies at Otis Art Institute (as the 
Otis/Parsons Art Institute in Los Angeles was then called), a bastion of the 
white art world. And, according to the catalogue from "Hispanic Art in the 
United States" -- the recent Los Angeles County Museum survey exhibition, in 
which he was represented -- by the late '70s he and his colleagues had 
"gradually detached" themselves from the Chicano art movement. 
</P>
<P>
Almaraz's present subject matter roams all over the map, snagging lush fantasy 
and everyday life with the same carousing imagination and skittering brush. 
</P>
<P>
In the painting "End of an Era," two generously endowed nude women holding 
parasols pass the time with an artist of indeterminate sex seated at his or her 
easel; a monkey watches, its tail sketched in with a serpentine lick of the 
brush. Everyone floats in groundless space that shades from oranges and yellows 
into blues and greens. Profiled heads -- a clown, a Greek god -- appear as if 
conjured up by dream-vision. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the "era" in question is the now distant-seeming time when art was a 
more clearly defined and broadly accessible enterprise -- when artists really 
did work from models, and when the myths and symbols artists drew upon were an 
integral part of the culture. (Traditionally, for example, monkeys were symbols 
of lasciviousness.) 
</P>
<P>
In a completely different mood, the painting "Remote Control" shows Almaraz 
using his powers of painterly exaggeration to find the hypnotic quality of the 
boob-tube experience. A splat! of paint snaps over the edge of the screen, as 
if transmitting energy from the remote control device held in the hand of a 
seated figure with a flat head. Big scribbles of Almaraz's brush block in the 
blinding glow of a lamp. Behind the TV set, a giant column rises -- maybe just 
a familiar piece of furniture eerily distorted, maybe an image symbolic of 
TV-viewing as idol worship. 
</P>
<P>
In a pastel drawing, "Suave Como la Noche," the artist takes yet another 
fruitful detour. By wildly exaggerating the colors of this street scene, he 
puts his finger on the eerie lushness of Southern California by night. Street 
lights beam triangular pools of green light, the moon is full and fuzzy, and 
orange tree trunks slice through the fuchsia sky. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Almaraz always hits the mark. In "Dunce's Dream," where he gives up 
his fancy-free brushwork for a cast of firmly outlined figures, he 
miscalculates. The cast of characters has a shopworn quality, and the tone 
seems ponderously allegorical. The viewer begins to suspect that what counts in 
Almaraz's work is not so much his ideas as his insight into moments of 
perception -- particularly involving light -- and his intense dedication to the 
physical activity of painting. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who is 14 years younger, was born in Las Vegas and studied at Cal State 
Los Angeles and at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. She paints in 
a broad-brushed style that looks, in large-scale compositions, rather unformed 
and unsure of itself, and whose scope is limited on a small scale. Yet the 
primal energy of the work reveals Flores' intense receptivity to the realms of 
dream and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dreamscape," a large, very loosely rendered work, vague figures wander in 
whirling, paint-spattered territory. Light from a house spreads out of a window 
like a solid object. A fiery, pop-eyed devil's head from her "Head Series" 
paintings bursts like a volcano with hot colors and spatters of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Who is to say what is specifically "Chicano" in these various approaches to 
painting, and what is not? Do these two artists come by their openness to 
fantasy, their love of color, their passion for light, their energetic brush 
styles from some cultural wellspring in their families' heritage? Or are these 
essentially personal choices, fed by exposure to art and religion and movies 
and literature and college psychology classes? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the sources for art are so complex and diverse that the "labels" 
make little sense. In an era of well-intentioned surveys of "ethnic" art in its 
presumed context, it is a pleasure to see this work exhibited all by itself, 
with no special fanfare, simply as the products of two singular imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 Works by Carlos Almaraz and Elsa Flores are on view through Nov. 7 at the Art 
Institute of Southern California, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
Gallery hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

<TEXT>
   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) _ It's been a long, strange trip
for the oil painting of the nude woman and Cupid now hanging in a
Bard College gallery.
   The painting was found years ago in a hayloft with a modest fig
leaf painted on Cupid and the chubby, prone woman's breasts
enlarged. A private collector bought the painting, removed the
bogus overpainting and cleaned it over three years.
   The collector, who refuses to reveal his identity, says he's
convinced the painting was created in a Venice studio by Titian,
one of the greatest painters of the Italian Renaissance.
   The art world isn't so sure.
   That puts the purported Titian in the same boat as many of the
80 works of art exhibited at ``A Connoisseur's Quest,'' a new
gallery exposition at this Hudson Valley college.
   Paintings from Europe, carvings from Africa and ancient Egyptian
pottery are coming under scrutiny for the first time as art
detectives try to weed out bonafide masterpieces from artful
forgeries.
   Art historians and others who breath the rarefied air of the art
world have begun debating whether particular works are really
Raphael's or Durer's or El Greco's.
   ``Some of these pieces will be shrouded in mystery for the rest
of their existence,'' said Linda Weintraub, curator of the Edith C.
Blum gallery.
   The exhibit, which Weintraub shepherded here, is unique in that
the pieces are being shown to the public for the first time after
being held in a private collection for decades _ some for up to 50
years.
   The collector credits Weintraub, a longtime acquaintance, with
persuading him to share his private treasure with the public after
all these years. His identity though, remains hidden so as not to
deflect attention from the art, he said.
   ``The object of the collection is not the collector. The object
is the art,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I'm glad to have
it scrutinized.''
   The scrutiny in this case means students of art looking for
subtle clues that would place a work in time, or a technique that
would distinguish a creation as belonging to a particular artist.
   The question with the picture of the nude woman and Cupid is
whether the painting is a first version of Titian's ``Danae,''
which depicts the picture's namesake just after being impregnated
by Zeus.
   Weintraub said such aficionados as former Metropolitan Museum of
Art curator Thomas Hoving have applied their critical eye to the
work and believe it to have come from the brush of Titian.
   One dissenting voice comes from artist Martin Canin who says
``the painting lacks the quality of execution'' to be a real Titian.
   ``I'm sure it's not,'' he said. ``There's just too many bad
passages.''
   Canin said his painter's eyes can see what many art historians
cannot. In ``Danae,'' he sees an un-Titian-like linear approach to
the work and an ``amateurish'' painting of the figures' feet and
toes. Canin thinks the painting was a product of a contemporary
workshop or student.
   A big problem with sorting out the works of the European masters
is that most of them trained their young students to paint just
like them _ often exactly like them. Weintraub said many students
were instructed to paint over the master's sketches and even copy
their work outright.
   ``Even pieces with signatures can easily have been done by
students,'' she said.
   Also, in the days before photocopiers or even photos, copying
the great contemporary works by hand for affluent buyers was a
common practice.
   Unlike people who study stones or stars, art sleuths usually
rely on more esoteric means to weed out masterworks from copies.
   Bonnie Solomon, an art restorer with Solomon &amp; Mattozzi of New
York City, shined a black light on ``Danae'' to determine if the
work was fudged with overpainting.
   ``There was some work done on it, but not a lot,'' she said.
Solomon said she's pretty sure the Titian is the real thing along
with another possible masterpiece by the European master El Greco,
but admitted there are some incredible fakes in existence.
   The presumed El Greco, a palm-sized painting of Christ at
Calvary looking imploringly up to heaven, could represent the
finest of the painter's work.
   Then again, just like the Titian, it could be the work of one of
his rivals or students, or any exceptionally talented painter
familiar with El Greco's work.
   ``This could be a student's, it could be a copy, it could be
from 200 years after his death,'' Weintraub said. ``But look at his
eyes. How could it be by anyone else?''
   Even established works of art can become suspect. Vincent Van
Gogh's ``Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' is familiar to anyone who
has ever flipped through an art book. The painting has been in the
Metropolitan for years as one of the pearls in its collection. Now,
a leading scholar has raised questions about its authenticity.
   ``There's little certainty about any work,'' Weintraub offered.
   Paintings for non-European works are less problematic in terms
of determining the creator. Artisans kept a lower public profile in
most other cultures and so works by any particular person tend to
be less in demand in the art world.
   But they do pose other problems.
   ``Some of these works, we just have no idea where they're
from,'' Weintraub said.
   Works shown in the Bard exhibit such as the Chinese Buddha and
little icons of Egyptian deities are easy to trace, but others
aren't. Experts agree a small, carved ivory spoon shown at Bard is
from Africa. But where, when and even the why of the spoon is
debatable.
   ``All the scholars are bewildered,'' Weintraub said. ``Even if
there's a consensus, it's never absolutely known.''
   Still, the mystery collector says he's relatively unconcerned
that someone might soon come up with some devastating evidence his
Durer or ancient Greek coins are not what they appear to be.
   ``I bought all the work for its visual power,'' he said. ``It
wouldn't change the effectiveness of the work one bit.''

Art lovers who also find excitement in that national pastime -- the game of 
baseball -- can combine both interests by visiting "Diamonds Are Forever: 
Artists and Writers on Baseball," an exhibition combining both visual artworks 
and literature on the game, opening at the Oakland Museum on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes 112 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and 
sculpture, and features works by artists including Claes Oldenburg, Raoul Dufy, 
Elaine de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Alex Katz and Eric Fischl. 
Featured literary passages on baseball are by John Updike, Garrison Keillor, 
Phillip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Neil Simon and others. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an absolute commonality of experience in the life of the (artists and 
writers) represented in the exhibition," said Don Grant, the museum's head 
preparator and exhibition designer. "Baseball is a part of all of our 
experience, at least at one point in time. And I think that's one of the 
reasons for (the artists') doing these works -- to give a sense of importance 
to the game and to people's experiences at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Grant said another reason for the exhibition, which was organized by the New 
York State Museum in Albany, is to "illustrate the mythic or iconic quality of 
baseball as it's perceived in many people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
One work that particularly illustrates that "mythic" quality, Grant said, is 
Michael Langenstein's "Play Ball." In a takeoff on Michelangelo's "Creation of 
Adam," Langenstein's post-card collage depicts Michelangelo's hand reaching up 
to the hand of God and passing him a baseball. The work illustrates the passing 
on of youth and innocence that can be accomplished through baseball, Grant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other themes depicted in the art works, Grant said, include "archetypal 
conflict situations (in which) one person is poised against all the elements," 
and works that "speak to how one's image as a kid growing up is . . . formed in 
relation to other kids (by) comparing oneself through baseball." As an example 
of the latter, Grant cited "Boys at Bat," by Eric Fischl, which shows "an image 
of a naked ball player, an older boy, batting, and a younger boy looking on." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is divided into five thematic sections -- The Place, The 
Equipment, The Players, The Action and Something Else, which involves less 
tangible elements such as childhood memories and the smells of spring -- runs 
through Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: Works of art by Los Angeles workers whose unions are affiliated with the 
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, and three paintings by union 
guest artist Phyllis Diller go on view Monday at the City Hall Bridge Gallery, 
201 N. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
The "20th Annual Union Artist Exhibit" includes 115 pieces of painting, 
sculpture and photography. Works by union members and their children were 
entered in a juried competition that included the categories of amateur works, 
professional works, high school and college works, grade-school works, and 
works by undocumented workers who have applied for amnesty through the county 
labor federation's Labor/Immigration Project. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federation, the purpose of the show is to call attention to 
the "hidden" talents of working people. 
</P>
<P>

ART WORLD: GEORGE YEPES: HE PAINTS FOR HISTORY -- AND FOR THE MOVIES, TOOFACES 
</P>

"I refuse to be one of 'the boys,' " said George Yepes, as he lashed out at 
what he called the current trend for curators, dealers and others to group all 
Latino artists together. "I don't want to be grouped with the artists that are 
out right now. These guys today took the guts out of Hispanic art. People like 
Siqueiros, Orozco -- the old Mexican masters -- they are rolling over in their 
graves right now. But they have to pass the baton over to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Yepes' latest attempts to run with that baton went on view Thursday at Santa 
Monica's B-1 Gallery. The artist's reception for the show, called "Midnight 
Devil Dancing," will be held June 28. 
</P>
<P>
Featured are about 10 paintings, including the 25-foot "Self Portrait 1990: 
Rapture of the Sublime," which depicts Yepes and his ever-present fiance locked 
in a kiss, surrounded by a number of fighters and slain figures representing 
"the casualties of war today." Also included in the autobiographical work is a 
pair of boxers in a ring -- reminiscent of the days when Yepes himself boxed -- 
and a series of green-faced men, which Yepes said represents the attorneys now 
embroiled in his life because of disputes with East Los Streetscapers, a mural 
painting group that Yepes left a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yepes, 34, who recently completed the "Lady of the East Side" mural at 4th 
Street and the 101 Freeway, has four additional mural projects under 
discussion, as well as two more pending approval of Cultural Affairs grants 
from the city of Los Angeles. But his next project is for a totally different 
medium -- the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
The artist has been commissioned by the producers of "Bewitched Affair" -- 
which stars Mark Hamill and Apollonia and begins filming this week -- to paint 
works for a gallery that will be created as one of the film's key locations. 
</P>
<P>
For the film, which will include "a huge love scene" right under one of his 
works, Yepes plans to paint "kind of epic things" dealing mainly with passion 
and witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
The short-haired, clean-cut Yepes -- dressed in a white Yves Saint Laurent 
dress shirt and black slacks and shoes -- noted that he doesn't look like a 
typical artist and doesn't fit in with the "misdirected calling that says (to 
be an artist) you've got to have long hair or a beard, live like an artist, and 
have paint on your pants." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says: "What's important is the art. I'd rather somebody know my 
work than know me. . . . I paint for history -- for what they're going to say 
about the artwork 50 years from now. I want history to look back . . . and say, 
'Wow, this guy could paint.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum will put its $8,500 National Endowment for the Arts grant 
toward the purchase of a set of the 150 prints produced to date by Los Angeles' 
Self-Help Graphics. Included are works by 70 artists such as Diane Gamboa, 
Frank Romero and Gronk. 
</P>
<P>
According to Self-Help Graphics' curator Alex Alferov, the museum's purchase 
will give more importance to the work done by the nonprofit workshop and its 
Hispanic artists. 
</P>
<P>
Self-Help Graphics is excited about the purchase because being in a prestigious 
museum collection validates all the years of work founder and director Sister 
Karen Boccalero has done with the Latino artists, Alferov said. "For the 
artists it is a confidence builder and gives historical value to their work as 
it becomes part of a major collection." 
</P>
<P>
Self-Help Graphics began producing prints in 1982 by inviting Chicano artists 
from East Los Angeles to collaborate with master printers. The Laguna museum 
plans to exhibit the prints in a series of exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Two fourth-grade classes from San Pedro Street School in downtown Los Angeles 
will participate in a new educational outreach program set up at the County 
Museum of Art in conjunction with the exhibition "The New Vision: Photography 
Between the World Wars." The program, called "Family Keepsakes," includes 
activities in both the museum and the classroom. The goal of "Family Keepsakes" 
is to introduce children to photography and other media as a means of creative 
expression and interpretation of the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the program will create their own family keepsakes -- an album of 
photographs, drawings or other objects they have created and collected. These 
projects will then be circulated by the museum's Education Department to 
schools and public libraries throughout the L.A. area begining in the fall of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Art dealers Richard Heller and Bennett Roberts are no longer content with 
simply running their own Richard/Bennett Gallery on La Brea Avenue. The two 
have now taken to curating shows for other galleries, the first of which is 
"The New Fabricants," a show featuring 14 emerging artists, which opened Friday 
at Santa Monica's Richard Green Gallery. Other curatorial projects underway for 
the duo include a group show opening June 21 at S. Bitter-Larkin Gallery in New 
York and a show scheduled for next February at Peter Weber Gallery in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Neo-pop artist Jim Evans will be honored on Wednesday at a special reception at 
6:30 p.m. at the Karl Bornstein Gallery in Santa Monica. On view for the 
one-night only will be 30 of Evans' original monoprints, proceeds from the sale 
of which will benefit Westside Sane/Freeze, a national peace and nuclear 
disarmament organization. 
</P>
<P>
Evans was commissioned by Westside Sane/Freeze to create a work commemorating 
the eighth anniversary of the United Nations Special Session on Nuclear 
Disarmament, as well as the January, 1991, U.N. Conference on Disarmament. The 
work, "End of the Dream," depicts Albert Einstein surrounded by symbols of the 
nuclear arms race and the scientist's famous quote, "You cannot simultaneously 
prevent and prepare for war."

"When you look at all that we're competing against (such as movie premieres and 
other star-studded events), it's nice to see that art can still draw a crowd."

turnout -- which included such artists as George Herms, Robert Graham and Lita 
Albuquerque as well as Meryl Streep, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kim Carnes, and 
several paparazzi and media types -- at a recent Santa Monica gallery reception 
for "Artists Unite for Big Green," a benefit for the Environmental Protection 
Act of 1990 initiative.

VISUAL ARTISTS, MANY OF WHOM CONSIDER THEMSELVES OUTSIDERS, FOCUS ON THE GAPS 
BETWEEN CULTURES

<P>
By Cathy Curtis, Curtis is a Times staff writer who covers art and dance in 
Orange County.

<TEXT>
<P>
The "outsider" viewpoints of people who don't feel at home within a dominant 
culture are at the heart of the visual arts component of the Los Angeles 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these artists are looking at each other's Pacific Rim cultures with a 
coolly dissecting eye, allowing Eastern and Western ideas and images to invade 
one another and raise more questions than they answer. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists are in some sense strangers to their own societies -- because of 
cultural roots, sexual orientation or a rejection of the consumer-oriented 
practices of the contemporary art world. 
</P>
<P>
At the University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach (Friday through Dec. 2), 
Chinese artist Wenda Gu will create a site-specificinstallation, "Red, Black, 
White, Desert." The work will involve the juxtaposition of raincoats made of 
woven palm bark -- the type worn by rural Chinese workers -- with minimalist 
abstract canvases painted in alternating fields of red, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this work lies an idiosyncratic way of viewing the world that, for all 
its brash contemporaneity, stems from the tradition of the great 
"individualist" artists of the Yuan and early Ch'ing Dynasties -- maverick 
artists like Hung-jen and Chu Ta, who retired from the world during tumultuous 
periods of Chinese history and cultivated eccentric signature styles. The 
difference is that Gu remains very much a part of the world, making art that is 
political by implication, if not in overt ways. 
</P>
<P>
Gu, who now lives in New York, was born in Shanghai in 1955. As a child of the 
Cultural Revolution, he painted propaganda posters before attending the School 
of Arts and Crafts in his native city and studying the traditional arts of 
(wooden) seal carving and landscape painting. 
</P>
<P>
An obsessive reader and philosophizer, in the tradition of the literati 
painters of Chinese history, Gu became interested in the writings of such 
vastly disparate Western philosophers as Friedrich Nietzsche and Ludwig 
Wittgenstein and the works of such modern Western artists as Marcel Duchamp, 
Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys. 
</P>
<P>
He began to see his work as a way of stirring up the caldron of past and 
present -- of combining slogans he saw on the street with ancient poems and 
making mutant seals in which the calligraphy was fractured and rearranged. 
Slamming together bits and pieces of diverse eras, lifestyles and cultures in 
his installations, he finds conflict more fruitful than the aura of tranquility 
generally associated with Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
Delighting in paradoxes and riddles, he is a black humorist with a strong 
mystic streak. Describing a 1987 performance piece of his involving bloody 
gloves, red tubes and a small house structure made of mixed media paintings, Gu 
wrote, "The atmosphere was very sexual and painful. Only my desire was 
present." 
</P>

At the Long Beach Museum of Art, "Traversals: Instructions to the Double" 
(today through Sept. 30) is a program of nine videotapes assembled by guest 
curator Peter Callas. The works in the show are all by Pacific Rim artists who 
have visited other cultures and responded not with travelogues but with 
open-ended, highly subjective meditations. Unconventional editing and 
post-production work emphasizes the rhythms and layers of imagery the artists 
perceived in their travels. 
</P>
<P>
In Edin Velez's "Meaning of the Interval" (18 minutes, 1987), the subject is 
empty space. Known as ma in Japan, prolonged intervals -- of space or time -- 
are considered a source of harmonic energy. They exist everywhere: in 
buildings, paintings, even on the slow-moving Noh theater stage. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico-born Velez (who now lives in New York) looks at the large and small 
manifestations of ma in Japan: from the distance between one subway station and 
another to a stark white line that divides in half -- revealed as the space 
between the two pillars of a Shinto temple gateway. Using post-production 
wizardry to alter the sizes and positions of his imagery, Velez also emphasizes 
peculiar juxtapositions of conservative and outre behavior in modern-day Japan. 
These are the "spaces" that separate different pockets of life in a 
hierarchical and superficially orderly society. 
</P>
<P>
Naoko Kurotsuka's "The Palm" (5 minutes, 1985) was shot at a long-abandoned 
temple arch in the ruins of Ayuttheya in Thailand -- a site at once familiar to 
a Japanese (because of the countries' shared Buddhist culture) and undeniably 
foreign. Static shots focus on details of the natural world that continues to 
flourish despite the lack of human presence. To begin and end each shot, the 
Japanese artist cupped her hands over the lens, as if helping each image to be 
born and to die. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westerners consider ancient, unchanging landscape as the essence of 
timelessness, Kurotsuka writes, in the East, timelessness is equivalent to "the 
ever-changing state of temporary nature." 
</P>
<P>
Other video artists represented in the show are Geoffrey Weary, Robert Cahen, 
Ko Nakajima, Tony Conrad, Steina Vasulka, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto and Callas. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Photography Center, "Golden Pool" (Sept. 4 through Oct. 14) 
brings together the photographic work of 12 artists -- some established, some 
emerging -- who live in Southern California and explore different aspects of 
Asian and Asian-American cultural experience. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Lee blows up stills from Chinese movies of the '20s, '30s and '40s to 
"big screen" size and adds statements reflecting her ironic take on the 
contemporary status of Chinese-American women. Carol Nye's black-and-white 
photographs investigate the ways minority groups in China adapt to the dominant 
culture. Other artists in the exhibit include May Sun, Patrick Nagatani and 
Alan Cheung. 
</P>
<P>

"Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" at the Wight Art Gallery, 
UCLA (Sept. 9 through Dec. 9) is a huge show, the largest ever assembled 
specifically on the art of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. (as distinct from 
Latino, Hispanic or Latin American art). This emphasis is on the relationship 
of the art to el movimiento, the Chicano civil rights movement of the '60s and 
'70s, which focused on demands for workers' rights, bilingual education, the 
abolition of racist cultural barriers, and the return of land to the 
descendants of original land-grant holders. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 130 paintings, prints, photographs and sculptures are the work of 
90 artists from across the U.S., chosen by a national advisory committee. It 
remains to be seen whether the show -- which unfortunately does not include 
performance or installation art -- will make a compelling case for individually 
distinctive voices of members of a minority group, or sink under the weight of 
curatorship-by-committee.

<P>
David Wojnarowicz's "Tongues of Flame," at the Santa Monica Museum of Art 
(through Sept. 5) is an exhibit of the artist's passionate and motley pieces 
from the past decade, which all deal in some way with his life as a gay man. 
Wojnarowicz -- who suffers from complications of AIDS and who endured a 
shockingly brutal and loveless youth -- works from the position of radical 
social outcast. By turns darkly fantastic and coldly nihilistic, his imagery of 
death, decay, violence, male sexuality and technological malfunction is 
virtually guaranteed to raise bourgeois hackles.

Robbie Conal's brand of guerrilla warfare is a kinder, gentler phenomenon, 
notable mostly for the dogged persistance with which he plasters thousands of 
his political posters throughout the U.S. Organized by the Pasadena Art 
Alliance, "Unauthorized History: Robbie Conal's Portraits of Power" at the 
Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena (Sept. 8 through Nov. 9), includes his 
deliberately unflattering images of such Reagan-Bush era figures as Jim and 
Tammy Bakker, John Poindexter, Jesse Helms and Ronald, Nancy and George.
