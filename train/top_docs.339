<LEADPARA>  Anthropologists digging into an 8th century pyramid in Guatemala say they
opened a tomb of what may be one of the last great leaders of the Mayan
civilization.;    Officials at Vanderbilt University announced Tuesday that a
group led by Arthur Demarest, a professor of anthropology, removed the final
loose stones under an ancient Mayan pyramid and found a skeleton wearing a
bejeweled headpiece.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tracey Ferrell, the project administrator at Vanderbilt, said she talked
briefly with Demarest on Tuesday and was told that the researchers found the
skeleton amid elaborately decorated pottery and knife blades made of obsidian
glass.;    "It's definitely a ruler of some kind," Ferrell said. "Obsidian was
an elite material in the Mayan world because it had to be brought from far
away.";    Obsidian is a volcanic glass. Knives made from the material were
used in bloodletting ceremonies among the royalty, she said.;    The pyramid
is in an ancient city known as Dos Pilas that is thought to have been the
capital of the Petexbatun region of Guatemala. It is near the present city of
Antigua.;    Ferrell said Demarest reported that the headdress adorning the
skeleton was made of mother of pearl, shells and jade, and said to be in
excellent condition.;    Workers are tediously removing soil and debris around
the skeleton, and Ferrell said the legs have been uncovered.;    Pottery in
the tomb is covered in hieroglyphics that may give clues to the relationship
of the Mayan center where the pyramid is situated and the rest of the Mayan
civilization.;    Ferrell said the skeleton may be that of a monarch known to
researchers as Ruler 2. This name is used because no other has been found.;   
Demarest, who has been excavating in the area for two years, said in a report
that the royal tomb was located on the edge of a great plaza and is near a
monument, called Stela 8, that is dedicated to Ruler 2. The stela bears a date
of A.D. 715.;    "Ruler 2 was one of the kings that launched the ambitious
program of conquest in the 8th century," Demarest reported. This led to
formation of what he called the largest territorial state in Maya history. By
A.D. 740, he said the kingdom started by Ruler 2 stretched for 1,500 square
miles along the Pasion River.;    Researchers believe the father of Ruler 2,
known only as Ruler 1, was expelled from the Mayan city of Tikal a generation
earlier. He went 60 miles into the jungle and established Dos Pilas.;    Ruler
2, Demarest said, was the key figure in five decades of war that "may have
destroyed the ecology of the region.";    He said the war and the expansion of
Ruler 2 empire may have changed the agriculture system of the area and forced
farmers into agrarian habits that stripped the land. War may have finally
forced the population to seek shelter in defensible areas of the city.;   
Eventually, the Mayan civilization collapsed in about A.D. 830.;    Ferrell
said there is evidence that the city was placed under siege at one point.
Stones from the pyramid and other structures were arranged in a circle around
the city. Within these circles are weapons artifacts, suggesting the intense
warfare that was waged.;    When the pyramid was first discovered, Ferrell
said, it appeared to be only a mound covered with grass and trees. Centuries
of weathering had removed mortar from around the stones, leaving them loose.
Workers had to shore up a shaft being dug into the pyramid to prevent the
large rocks from falling.;    Artifacts recovered from the dig cannot be
removed from Guatemala and eventually will be stored in the national museum
there, she said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A jungle-shrouded city of pyramids and
temples in Guatemala was built as long ago as 630 B.C., showing
that Mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than
believed, scientists say.
   The findings may make the ancient city of Nakbe in northern
Guatemala one of the oldest in the Americas, researchers said.
   ``It's a very significant discovery,'' said Arthur Demarest,
anthropology chairman at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
   The University of California, Los Angeles, on Monday announced
the findings by archaeologist Richard Hansen and colleagues at
UCLA, Utah's Brigham Young University and Guatemala's University of
San Carlos.
   ``We have substantial evidence that this is the earliest Maya
urban center ever found,'' Hansen said.
   BYU anthropology chairman Donald Forsyth added, ``We're now
going to have to push the beginning of Maya civilization back
further into the past.''
   Archaeologists once believed advanced Mayan civilization emerged
around A.D. 300 and ended 600 years later during what is described
as the ``classic period.'' Research conducted during 1978-83 at El
Mirador, Guatemala, pushed that date back to 200 B.C.
   But in excavating Nakbe, 350 miles north of Guatemala City and
not far from El Mirador, Hansen's 50-member team determined that
roughly 100 stone pyramids and other buildings were from about 630
B.C. to 400 B.C. So were some of the site's 65,000 pottery pieces,
sculptures, figurines and other artifacts.
   Dates can be determined by the radioactivity of carbon in
organic material associated with buildings. Pottery is dated by
comparison with the style of shards from elsewhere in Central
America.
   ``We have from 1000 B.C. to 600 B.C. a small village with wooden
buildings,'' Hansen said by telephone from his home in Rupert,
Idaho. ``Then all of a sudden _ boom! They brought in rock and fill
and buried the village and made platforms. On those they placed
their buildings.''
   Hansen said Nakbe's buildings include 35- to 150-foot-tall
platforms and flat-topped pyramids, many of which are topped by
three small temples and sculpture depicting important gods and
kings. The buildings are solid, without interior rooms.
   The scale of construction reflects the emergence of an
administrative and religious elite to command thousands of workers,
Hansen said.
   Anthropologist John Graham of the University of California,
Berkeley, said an even earlier center of advanced Mayan
civilization may be found.
   Still, Graham said, the Nabke study ``is part of the most
exciting Maya discovery of recent decades.''
   The discovery solves a puzzle for archaeologists: The Mayans
seemed to evolve more slowly from farming communities to cities
than other pre-Columbian civilizations to the north and south. But
archaeologists say Nakbe proves that Mayan development occurred
more or less in step with the rise of the Olmec culture in Mexico,
thought to be the oldest civilization of the Americas.
   An archaeologist mapped some of Nakbe's architecture in 1962.
Hansen first visited in 1987 and his team conducted the first
full-scale excavation last February through April.
   Hansen's team hacked their way through dense jungle for three
days and 40 miles to reach Nakbe from the nearest road. They hauled
water from a swamp 4 miles away. Demarest admiringly called it
``macho archaeology.''
   Among the most important finds at Nakbe is a sculpture on a
limestone slab that probably dates from about 400 B.C. and is about
10 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 18 inches thick.
   The sculpture of two royal figures and a god ``is the earliest
and largest preclassic sculpture ever found,'' Hansen said.
   Other discoveries include seashells and obsidian glass tools
that indicate emergence of long-distance trade. There also are
signs of a society taming its environment: gutter-like water
collection systems on six buildings and 60-foot-wide stone-and-mud
roads, Hansen said.
   He said he believes transformation from village to city happened
because trade and the need for water and transportation fostered
emergence of an administrative and religious elite, which then
ordered construction of temples.

<TEXT>
   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of
Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society.''
   The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the second century A.D., which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' Winfield said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the Yucatan
Peninsula, more than 700 miles to the east, Winfield said at the
museum in Xalapa, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in
their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars,
equivalent to May 22, 143 (A.D.), and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' Winfield
said.
   If the mysterious people did exist, Winfield said, they also
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who
emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the
artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one
century later.
   ``They could be the Xicalancas, of which Clavijero briefly
talked about,'' Winfield said, referring to the Rev. Francisco
Javier Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787), a Jesuit priest who
was the first to systematically study Mexico's ancient languages
and peoples.
   In his ``History of Ancient Mexico,'' Clavijero in three lines
briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the
Olmecs, but did not go into details.
   In ``nahuatl,'' the trading language of the Aztecs, who came
much later, Xicalanca means ``the people who live by the Great Body
of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of Mexico was called.
   The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in
the village of La Mojarra, where the Piojo River meets the Acula
River. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be
reached only by boat, Winfield said.
   La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the Acula
about 20 miles south of the port of Alvarado in Veracruz state. But
neither the village nor the Piojo River can be found on any map of
Mexico.
   Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of
basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length
profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering.
   ``He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest
_ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region
in ancient times,'' Winfield said.
   The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four
representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight
feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic.
   A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat
rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 ``elements'' like the
rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab.
   ``It was all carved during one continuous period,'' Winfield
said. ``It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient Mexico.''
   About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded
top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the Acula, just
outside La Mojarra.
   Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of
villagers.
   Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but Winfield said he kept
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed ``without the
pressure that such a discovery creates.''
   The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the
region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one
of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the
museum, is so badly damaged it cannot be studied, Winfield said.
   In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing.
   That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf
cultures. The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the
Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of
fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers.
   A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces
in a cardboard box.
   ``We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let
the museum have it,'' Winfield said.
   Winfield suspects the La Mojarra area could have been a
ceremonial site.
   ``If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be
found,'' he said.

<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists digging in the jungle of Guatemala have found the tomb and
remains of an eighth-century ruler who they believe began the policies of
militarism and territorial expansion that eventually led to the collapse of
the classical Maya civilization.;    Dr. Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, announced Tuesday that the discovery
was made beneath the ruins of a pyramid at Dos Pilas, the ancient capital of
the Petexbatun region of Guatemala.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TEAM SAYS IT FOUND TOMB OF WARLIKE KING WHO
DESTROYED MAYAS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The tomb contained the skeleton of a man accompanied by a regal headdress
of jade, conch and pearl, obsidian blades probably used in bloodletting
ceremonies and ceramics inscribed with hieroglyphics.;    King's burial site; 
Scholars at the site said they were almost certain that the skeleton is that
of Ruler 2, so called because the hieroglyphics giving his name have not been
deciphered. A monument at the pyramid indicates that this is the burial site
of that particular king, and the writing on pottery found inside the tomb is
expected to confirm the skeleton's identity.;    "It looks like we've got a
large dead king in there," Demarest said in an interview by telephone from
Guatemala.;    The tomb's discovery, along with excavations of extensive
fortifications at Dos Pilas and other evidence of relentless warfare, is
expected to figure in new interpretations of the Mayas as a more militaristic
people than had been thought by earlier scholars.;    It could also illuminate
the causes of the mysterious fall of lowland Mayan culture beginning in the
eighth century and culminating in the 10th.;    Militaristic past;  "This is
going to change the textbooks radically," Demarest said. "Ruler 2 was a
pivotal figure in the initiation of the catastrophic sequence of events in
which the polity broke up into a dozen warring states that militarized the
landscape within a period of 50 years and may have destroyed the ecology of
the region.";    Ruler 2 reigned between 698 and 725 over the Petexbatun
region, which spanned some 2,000 square miles along the Pasion River in
northern Guatemala. Ruler 2 and his successor conquered neighboring
city-states and created the largest kingdom in Mayan history. The Mayas'
classic period began with the rise of large cities and elaborate ceremonial
centers around A.D. 250 and, in the south at least, collapsed by the year
900.;    Other archaeologists said this was one of the most significant recent
discoveries in Mayan studies. But many of them were not yet prepared to accept
Demarest's interpretation that a rapid escalation of warfare and territorial
expansion doomed the Mayan civilization.;    Theory disputed;  Dr. Jeremy A.
Sabloff, an authority on Mayan archaeology at the University of Pittsburgh,
called Demarest's research "very important and exciting" but said he doubted
that a single factor, like destructive warfare, accounted for the fall of the
Mayan civilization.;    Dr. David Webster, an archaeologist at Pennsylvania
State University who specializes in Mayan warfare, said the discovery "will
tell us a great deal about the dissolution of these kingdoms and about the
role of warfare in this dissolution.";    Excavations at Dos Pilas, Webster
said, focused attention on a major shift in scholarly attitudes toward the
Mayan culture. Until recent years, scholars tended to idealize the Mayas as
peaceful and industrious people. The only warfare was supposed to be the
limited, ritualized battles fought between rulers as part of dynastic
struggles, but rarely involving the common people.  </TEXT>

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Cultures before Columbus - An ancient art with a
modern feel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of
considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America
may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new
worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are
demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods'
from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered.
There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and
worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other
cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival
of the Spanish. The works have been assembled from the major public
collections of Mexico, judiciously supplemented by the British Museum
(Museum of Mankind).
It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican
art in London, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront
cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting
reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art
stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even
historical mindset.
A palma of Brancusi-like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as
pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function. A Totonac
sculptor carves a head in which only one half of the face is shown, the
other half left undefined and emerging from its stone casing. It is all one
can do to resist images of Michelangelo's bound figures in the Louvre. The
Chac Mool reclining on his elbows, was so thoroughly imbibed by Moore that
it seems here strangely familiar and modern. So too the Huastec sculptures
and a Veracruz jaguar mask which have a futuristic primitivism that is pure
Star Wars. Mexico can surely boast some of the most alien of all human art
and it is no accident that Eric von Daniken found here so much fodder for
his extra terrestrial dreamings.
Mayan art, widely regarded as the high-point of the Precolumbian
achievement, took the decorative and iconographic principles established by
the Olmecs in the centuries before Christ to a new level of delicacy and
refinement. Jaina ceramic figurines of a women, priests and warriors are
exquisite genre studies whose faces are to be seen all over the Yucatan to
this day. Jade was exploited to lavish effect in relief carvings and, most
spectacularly, in human masks. The so-called 'eccentric flints', fashioned
by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms,
remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece
of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a
remarkable facility for two-dimensional naturalism - an unexpected foil to
the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism.
One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the
revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of
the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Since the script is itself a pictorial code
whose understanding is intimately linked to the symbolism of Mayan art, this
new insight lifts a veil from Mayan iconography too. As in Egypt, much
ancient Mexican art needs to be deciphered in as precise and literal a way
as writing. The more official and ceremonial pieces are interspersed with
pottery and other items of everyday use, including rare wood-carvings. These
are much more spontaneous and imaginative, showing the exuberance of the
household or village craft tradition. In the human- and animal-shaped
vessels of the Colima potters lies a virtual menagerie of local wildlife and
domestic scenes - a baby, an emaciated hunchback, an acrobat - keenly
observed with real sympathy and inventively adapted to shapes that can also
function as vessels.
The show has been laid out with a keen eye for design and lighting, with
adequate wall tests including evocative quotations from ancient Mexican
texts. The designers have made the most of an awkward ramp at the entrance
by arranging a series of intimidating Huastec statues in sentry-like rows.
The layout of material is by regions, which only partly correspond to the
major cultural entities (Olmec, Maya, Aztec etc.) and cuts across both media
and periods. No system is perfect but this is a half-way measure which fully
serves neither an archaeological nor an artistic end.
The handsome catalogue is itself no small design achievement whose superb
illustrations provide much food for further thought and admiration. Alas the
text - a direct translation of the Spanish version - is rather idiosyncratic
in its selection of themes and suffers from the user-unfriendly focus of
academics. The short bibliography ignores most of the major English-language
studies.
The gold which fuelled the Conquistadores ravages is conspicuoulsy absent
from The Art of Mexico. This is only partly the result of the mindless orgy
in which the finest handiwork of the American goldsmiths was consigned
wholesale to the melting pot by the Spanish invaders. Unlike their South
American contemporaries, the Classic and earlier cultures of Mesoamerica did
not much value the yellow metal, importing it from the south only sparingly.
The Hayward show rightly avoids any hint of gold lust, focusing instead on
the myriad other artictic achievements of these most ill-fated of peoples.

<TEXT>     She was, of course, mistaken: At every bus stop in the capital, Mayan men
and women stand waiting for their rides to work. Yet the teen-ager's ignorance
was somehow logical.;    Her ancestors, the Spanish conquistadors, had wiped
out nine of every 10 Maya Indians they had found in Guatemala in the 16th
century.;    Four hundred years later, her people, called Ladinos, run a
government that does little more than the minimum to improve the lot of the
surviving indigenes, whom they call simply "Indios" and who constitute more
than 40 percent of the popula tion.;    The golden age of the ancient Maya,
the most advanced pre-Columbian civilization in the New World, lasted from
A.D. 250 to 900.;    During that time, they built such magnificent cities as
Chichen Itza, Palenque and Uxmal in Mexico; Copan in Honduras; and Caracol in
Belize. The greatest Mayan city of all is Tikal, which has become Guatemala's
No. 1 tourist attraction.;    But many of the visitors to the Tikal ruins
don't realize that more than 3 million Maya live in Guatemala today -- more
than are found in the other Central American countries and Mexico put
together. Guatemala remains the heartland of Mayan civilization.;    No
pretext for a visit to Guatemala is more compelling than to make acquaintance
with the Maya -- both ancient and living.;    There are many other reasons to
travel to our nearest Central American neighbor: The alpine beauty of the
volcanic highlands, a remarkably favorable exchange rate between the dollar
and the quetzal, a cross-cultural openness in the hinterlands that, in the
words of photojournalist Galen Rowell, reminds one of the free-and-easy hippie
ambiance of Katmandu in the 1960s.;    And, despite continuing skirmishes
between guerrillas and the army, Guatemala is safe for visitors. There is
little of the anti-American feeling found in El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Panama.;    Visitors fly into the capital, Guatemala City. A day there is long
enough, time to wander through its excellent museums housing everything from
ancient Mayan artifacts to modern art, before heading west.;    A smoggy
metropolis, the city was leveled by earthquakes in 1917 and 1976, and as a
result little remains of colonial architecture.;    Only 30 miles west lies
Antigua Guatemala, where the Spanish built a colonial capital to rival Mexico
City. The population today is only 16,000, but the town breathes the
melancholy grandeur of the conquest.;    Half-ruined baroque churches by the
dozen; clean cobblestone streets and bright-hued housefronts; a glimpse of
cool inner patios spangled with hand-painted tiles; and rising 7,000 feet
above the village, the steep blue cone of Volcan Agua, its summit lost in
mist.;    The road wends on, deeper into the highlands, till you come suddenly
upon Lake Atitlan, rimmed by tall mountains whose shoulders slope into the
dark water.;    Tucked in a wrinkle of its north shore is the village of
Panajachel, full of Cakchiquel-speaking Maya and blissed-out hippies, both
young and aging, from Germany, France, Sweden, Holland and even the United
States.;    A morning ferry traverses the lake to the village of Santiago
Atitlan. Cross the waters and you have changed cultures, though at first blush
the markets and churches look the same.;    In Santiago, though, the women
wear white garments, called huipils, instead of the red and blue huipils in
Panajachel. The people speak Tzutuhil instead of Cakchiquel.;    They were
once, in fact, enemies, and if you knew how to probe skillfully enough, you
might still uncover the old Tzutuhil bitterness against their neighbors, who
allied themselves with the butcher Pedro de Alvarado, a lieutenant of Hernando
Cortes, who conquered Guatemala in 1524, bringing Christianity with him.;   
Nothing in Mayan life today is more bizarre than the amalgamation of pagan
with Catholic beliefs.;    In the Santiago church, there is a statue of a
"saint" called Maximon, supposed to be a combination of Judas, Pedro de
Alvarado and the Mayan god Mam. Other towns have a Maximon, whom the people
revile every year during Holy Week. In Santiago, for some reason, at Easter
they take Maximon out of his cupboard, stick a cigar in his mouth and revere
him.;    The most intriguing highland town is Chichicastenango, 25 miles north
of Lake Atitlan. The town is an ancient center of the Quiche (KEE-chay), who
are among the most traditional of today's Maya.;    The market is held every
Thursday and Sunday. Rich in the superbly woven textiles for which the Maya
are famous, the market also displays cunning painted boxes, jade necklaces and
the lurid masks the Maya use in their dances.;    From the highlands,
travelers can fly to the Peten, in the northern lowlands, Guatemala's wild
west. There is only one paved road -- the main route to Tikal.;    The
countryside is seamed with rivers, and the outboard-powered dugout canoe is as
vital to commerce as the diesel truck.;    Flores, a tiny island town in Lake
Peten Itza, is worth a few days' stay.;    From there, you can hire a taxi for
the 40-mile trip to Tikal. Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, the most visited of
all Mayan cities, feels somehow tame, gardened and restored.;    But in Tikal,
deep in the tangled rain forest of the Peten, a primal rawness lingers about
the ruins. A team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania worked
for 13 years in Tikal in the 1960s and 1970s.;    They found more than 3,000
buildings spread over six square miles. Yet for all their labor, most of the
great city remains unexcavated.;    In Tikal, find your way to El Mundo
Perdido, the lost city, whose squat pyramids were built in the Pre-classic
era, long before anything else in Tikal.;    Or prowl through the North
Acropolis and locate the huge, grotesque molded heads hidden in dank side
chambers.;    Walk the Maler Causeway out to Group H, where the walls abound
in enigmatic Mayan graffiti. Climb to the roof comb of Temple IV, at 212 feet
the tallest building ever found in pre-Columbian America, and see how, for all
its grandeur, Tikal is nearly swallowed by the jungle that stretches to the
far horizon.; If you go . . .; (check) Getting There; Several airlines,
including Continental and American, fly to Guatemala City. From there, daily
flights go to Flores in the Peten. These cannot be booked from the United
States but are seldom sold out.;    (check) TOURS -- Several American travel
companies offer one- or two-week guided tours of Guatemala. One of the best is
run by Sobek Expeditions, P.O. Box 1089, Angels Camp 95222;(800) 777-7939.
Other tour operators include Overseas Adventure Travel, (617) 876-0533; Tara
Tours, (800) 327-0080; and Festival Tours, (800) 327-2838. The Guatemalan
Tourist Information Office is (305) 358-5110.;    (check) RENTAL CARS -- The
best way to see the highlands is by rental car, but it is easier and
remarkably inexpensive (about $40 a day or less) to hire a car and driver for
days at a time.;    (check) WHERE TO STAY -- The Hotel Atitlan in Panajachel,
with its secluded beach and splendid flower garden, may be the most delightful
inn in Guatemala. The Mayan Inn in Chichicastenango is a close rival. In
Flores there are a number of decent, cheap hotels ($15-$20 per night). The
Jungle Inn at Tikal has clean rooms and a funky ambiance.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Mayan Manuscript Found in Ancient Indian Village</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An archaeological team from the University
of Colorado excavating an ancient Indian village in El Salvador has
discovered what specialists think are the oldest known remains of a
Mayan manuscript.
   The fragmented remains of what appears to be a ``codex,''
pre-Columbian written records, were found on an adobe shelf in a
house buried by a volcanic eruption 1,400 years ago.
   Only three other Mayan codices are known to have survived the
destruction of the Spanish conquest. The origin of a fourth remains
in dispute among scholars. Most codices were religious records
dealing with the astronomical complexities of the Mayan calendar.
   If the fragments prove to be remains of a Mayan codex, it would
be not only the oldest such manuscript, but also the only one ever
discovered in an archaeological excavation, said Dr. Payson Sheets,
director of the dig and a professor of anthropology at CU-Boulder.
   The Joya de Ceren site, on the edge of a small farming village
about 16 miles north west of San Salvador, the capital, was buried
under 15 feet of powdery volcanic ash during the eruption of nearby
Laguna Caldera in the year 600, during the mid-Classic period of
pre-Columbian culture.
   ``The site probably contains the best preserved pre-Columbian
houses and organic remains in Central America,'' Sheets said.
   The fine-grained ash packed tightly around organic material,
giving a level of preservation rarely encountered in archaeology.
Before finding the codex, Sheet's team found wooden poles,
carbonized roof thatch, well-preserved beans in a pot, and intact
leaves.
   Rae Beaubien, a Smithsonian Institution preservation specialist,
flew to El Salvador last week to examine the codex. It is in
extremely poor condition, consisting of ordered layers of paint
flecks embedded in a block of volcanic ash. The paint probably once
covered pages of pounded bark parchments long since deteriorated,
said Beaubien.
   She said the find is ``extremely valuable,'' and even if none of
the writings are legible, scientists will analyze the types of
paint used and the components of the white background coating that
covered the parchment.
   Beaubien will transport the ash block containing the codex to
Smithsonian Institution laboratories in Washington for further
excavation and analysis.
   The oldest known codex prior to this find is dated at A.D.
900-1000.
   Most archaeological research in Central America has focused on
stone palaces and ceremonial centers that survived intact.
   ``As a result,'' said Sheets, ``we know a lot about how the
upper classes lived. But here at Ceren, the unusual level of
preservation provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to learn
about the lives of the lower and middle classes.''
   The Ceren site was discovered during a government construction
project in 1976 and partially excavated by Sheets in 1980. But that
work was suspended for nine years because of the Central American
nation's civil war.
   The current excavation began May 25 and will last through Aug.
12. The work is financed by a $90,000 grant from the National
Science Foundation.
   In the first house excavated, the team has identified women's
work areas for cooking, pottery and clothmaking. Chipped obsidian
tools were made, most likely by men, on a nearby thatch-roofed clay
platform. About 30 ceramic vessels, several intact, have been been
found.
   The scientists used ground-penetrating radar and measurements of
electrical resistance in the ground to find two more underground
structures that also are being excavated this summer.

NEW-FOUND SITE IN JUNGLE MAY BE FIRST MAYAN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UCLA archeologist has identified what is apparently the earliest major center 
of Mayan civilization yet found, a discovery that extends the era of Mayan 
cities back four centuries into a period that was thought to be dominated by 
simple village life. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive stone monuments and temples in the newly discovered city of 
Nakbe, in the dense tropical forest of northern Guatemala, show "that the 
advances which created the most sophisticated pre-Columbian society in the New 
World may have occurred much earlier than was previously assumed," said UCLA's 
Richard Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery will shed new light on why the Maya "accomplished things no other 
tropical forest society accomplished in the New World," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
The excavations at Nakbe, announced Monday by UCLA, are "of extraordinary 
importance to our understanding of the origin of Mayan civilization," said 
anthropologist David Friedel of Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings follow on the heels of surprising reports this summer by 
anthropologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University that the Mayan society 
-- previously believed to be one of history's most peaceful civilizations -- 
collapsed in the 9th Century AD as the result of internecine warfare. 
</P>
<P>
These new discoveries from the beginning and end of Mayan civilization, Friedel 
added, are "revealing with breathtaking clarity not only their (the Maya's) 
vision of the world, but the breadth and complexity of their political 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
The new find dates from a period when the Maya were transforming themselves 
from a centuries-old rural agrarian society to a more sophisticated and complex 
urban society. Researchers are particularly interested in the factors that led 
to this transformation because it sheds light on the more general question of 
how societies are formed. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are not yet sure, the researchers believe that urbanization arose 
as a mechanism to counter the innate hostility of the environment, to promote 
trade, and to consolidate religious and political ideologies. 
</P>
<P>
Nakbe lies in the isolated central department (state) of Peten in Guatemala, 
about 350 miles from Guatemala City. The site was first identified as a 
potential location of advanced Mayan civilization in 1930 by archeologists 
performing an aerial survey of the region. But no significant work occurred at 
the site until the UCLA team carried out its excavations from February through 
April of this year. 
</P>
<P>
That delay arose primarily as a result of the site's isolation. Nakbe "is three 
days on foot from the nearest road," Hansen said. "We used 123 mules to 
transport our stuff in, then kept 14 mules hauling water and supplies for the 
three months we were there. They had to cross swamps and wade through muck up 
to their bellies. It's hard to appreciate the problem if you haven't been 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the isolation probably protected the site from looting. 
</P>
<P>
Their excavations revealed thousands of artifacts, tombs and temple structures, 
some ranging from 40 to 65 feet in height. Other buildings on the site, which 
have not yet been excavated, are estimated to be as tall as 150 feet, which 
would rival pyramids from the more modern Mayan city of Tikal. 
</P>
<P>
The excavated buildings date from 600 to 400 BC, in the so-called middle 
Pre-Classic period. Previously, the most advanced structures from this period 
to be discovered were crude villages with low stone platforms measuring from 
three to six feet tall. Hansen has not yet dated the taller pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also dug up more than 65,000 potsherds, ceramics, human and 
animal figurines, seashells and obsidian and stone tools, which should reveal 
many details about everyday life in this first Mayan city. 
</P>
<P>
They also found an artifact that may prove to be one of the most significant 
Mayan sculptures ever discovered, a 10-foot-high fragmented slab of intricately 
carved limestone erected by Pre-Classic Mayan rulers. It depicts two 
individuals in royal clothing facing each other. One has his hand extended, 
pointing to a deity between them. Hansen believes the stone slab commemorates 
an important historical event whose nature he plans to discuss in a forthcoming 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen and his colleagues also found the remnants of an even earlier village 
below Nakbe, filled with soil and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"The construction appears to have preserved the village below," Hansen said in 
a telephone interview from his home in Rupert, Ida. "It's almost like finding a 
Mayan version of Pompeii," the Neapolitan city preserved intact when it was 
buried by an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of Nakbe must have been an enormous task, Hansen said. "All of 
the building materials had to be hauled to the location, rock by rock and 
basket by basket, by hundreds of Mayan workers to construct the massive 
platforms and buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Even drinking water was a problem. During their excavations, the UCLA team 
members had to haul water nearly four miles to the site on mules. "The Maya 
didn't have mules or beasts of burden to do that with," Hansen said. That lack 
led them to develop systems to collect rainwater from the roofs of temples and 
other buildings and channel it into storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem that must have impeded construction, Hansen said, is that the 
city was surrounded by swamps. "In order to maintain local trade and exchange, 
they had to construct causeways . . . large, rubble-filled constructions up to 
two yards high and 20 yards wide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That construction would have allowed them access to neighboring farmlands and 
would have consolidated political authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Maya were unique, Hansen said, because "they were able to achieve the 
greatest level of sophistication in the face of a very hostile environment." 
What researchers are trying to determine, he added, "is why they became 
sophisticated all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
The very hostility of the environment may have been a major civilizing 
influence, Hansen speculated. "It was so difficult to live there that it 
required centralized authority to maintain logistics and the life style they 
desired." 
</P>
<P>
Another clue to the civilizing influences was the large amount of seashells and 
obsidian discovered at Nakbe, all of which had to be imported from elsewhere. 
Hansen and others speculate that centralized authority was established in part 
to carry out such imports in exchange for a variety of goods, including food, 
chocolate, cotton textiles, forest products, medicines and jaguar pelts. 
</P>
<P>
"Seashells are very important to Maya public ceremonial life," said SMU's 
Friedel. "Great conch shells were used to fashion trumpets that were blown to 
declare the presence of the gods. Small shells were used as little bells and 
tinklers sewn onto the clothes of the elite for public ceremonies." Eventually 
the shells were also used as a form of money. 
</P>
<P>
Obsidian, he added, "was highly prized for ritual bloodletting and was a sacred 
material for all the people of meso-America." 
</P>
<P>
"Another factor, which we are hot on the trail of, is the role of religious 
ideology as an impetus in developing huge cities," Hansen said. The early 
leaders "had a huge control of labor to build these enormous buildings, and it 
appears from our excavations that the sole purpose was ideological. It's not 
funerary; we don't find burials like in later periods." 
</P>
<P>
The buildings did not necessarily serve as churches either, he said. "I'm more 
inclined to think that these buildings were constructed with the idea of 
consolidating the authority of an emerging elite and tying that into religious 
theology. That fits very well with what we know of later Maya mythology, where 
the king became divine and had divine ancestry." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen speculates that it was sometime during the era of Nakbe's construction 
that the authority of kings stopped being earned by achievement and started 
being passed down from fathers to sons. 
</P>
<P>
But solving these riddles, he said, "will take years and years of 
investigation."

MAYAS' DEMISE: A WAR WITHIN?; 
</P>
<P>
SITE REVEALS HEAVY FORTIFICATIONS

<P>
The mystery of the Maya demise has haunted anthropologists for centuries, but 
researchers may be on the verge of solving the sudden disappearance of one of 
history's most advanced civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Maya were "the most sophisticated, literate, complex people in the New 
World," according to anthropologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University. 
They erected massive pyramids, created a highly accurate calendar, perfected 
the art of astronomical observation, produced beautiful multicolored pottery 
and intricately carved stone monuments and established widespread trade routes. 
</P>
<P>
But after flourishing throughout much of Central America from the 3rd to the 
8th Century, they all but disappeared in the 9th Century, dispersing into small 
villages and seemingly losing most of their talents. 
</P>
<P>
Historians and archeologists have long pondered the reasons for this downfall, 
arguing at different times that losses of trade routes, changes in climate, 
endemic disease and many other related factors contributed to their downfall. 
In the past, most of the theories shared the premise that the Mayas were 
largely a peace-loving people who engaged in limited warfare only for 
ritualistic purposes and who met their demise through little fault of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
But new discoveries made this summer in the lowlands of Guatemala by a team 
headed by Demarest present a sharply different picture of the end of the Maya 
era. Demarest has discovered a heavily fortified Mayan city, called Punta de 
Chimino, that is "more massive than a medieval castle" in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearby city of Dos Pilas, he has found hastily erected stoneworks that 
suggest that the city was under heavy siege. These new discoveries, combined 
with previous excavations in the area, indicate that, at the height of the 
Mayan hegemony, the Mayan people were involved in ferocious internecine warfare 
that sapped their vitality and tore apart the fabric of their civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have few clues yet about what caused the sudden escalation of 
warfare that brought about the end of Mayan civilization -- although some 
evidence suggests the haunting possibility that it was triggered by 
over-exploitation of the environment, deterioration of the soil and pressure on 
food resources. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they do not know why the warfare started, the scientists 
believe they know who started it. Stelae (stone pillars with intricate 
carvings) from Dos Pilas identify a leader, known only as Ruler 2 because 
archeologists have not had time to translate his name, "who appears to be one 
of the kings from the beginning of the 8th Century who embarked on a program of 
territorial conquest," Demarest said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on many recent discoveries of evidence of warfare, especially this 
summer's, Demarest has concluded that, for a period of perhaps 50 to 60 years 
beginning about AD 825, warfare spread like a contagion throughout the region. 
Eventually, the economic system collapsed under the weight of the strain 
imposed by the intense combat and defensive measures and individual states 
within the area fell "like dominoes." 
</P>
<P>
By far the most important discovery made this summer is the Punta de Chimino 
site, which sits on a peninsula that juts into Lake Petexbatun in northwestern 
Guatemala, four days' journey from Guatemala City by plane, Jeep, canoe and 
mule. Researchers had known that a village existed on the site but had not 
explored it. 
</P>
<P>
"We went there to do a survey for a week," Demarest said by telephone from 
Antigua, Guatemala, where he has been recuperating from pneumonia and the 
parasitic diseases that are the bane of archeologists. The 36-year-old Demarest 
is the leader of a team of several American and Guatemalan archeologists, a 
dozen Vanderbilt graduate students and 50 Guatemalan workers that has been 
granted an exclusive permit by the Guatemalan government to dig up hundreds of 
square miles of the Mayan heartland in the Peten jungle. The $1-million project 
is funded by the National Geographic Society, the H. F. Guggenheim Peace 
Foundation and the largest archeological grant ever awarded by the National 
Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino "was not a very important component of our work," Demarest 
said. But what they found there made them change their plans instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayas who lived in Punta de Chimino excavated a massive ditch, 450 feet 
long and 50 feet deep, that cut the city off from the mainland, making it 
completely surrounded by water. In excavating the ditch through bedrock, 
Demarest said, the Mayas moved three times as much rock and stone as had been 
used to construct the city itself. "It's as if the United States were spending 
75% of its budget on defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino also had walls around its sides to protect it from attacks by 
canoes, and protected portages through which food could be brought in during a 
siege. "One of the reasons people have used to argue that Mayans were not 
warlike was the fact that their centers were completely indefensible," he said. 
"This is the exact opposite of that." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the walls of Punta de Chimino, Demarest found "a kind of shrunken Mayan 
state. It has all the characteristics of a Mayan ceremonial center, but on a 
smaller scale." Included were a single ball court (the Mayas played a sort of 
hybrid between soccer and basketball with great intensity; losers were 
sometimes sacrificed), one temple, one funerary, one set of stairways with 
hieroglyphics, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The fortress also had a large open area within the innermost wall that could 
have been used as a refuge for the population from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been almost impossible to take the place. It was really 
impregnable," Demarest said. "Those are terms you don't normally use in 
discussing Mayan architecture." 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino is "probably one of the few sites where the stereotype of 
archeology is accurate," he said. "It's like Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom." 
</P>
<P>
At nearby Dos Pilas, evidence of a different kind also suggests a sudden 
intensification of warfare. Dos Pilas is the classic, indefensible Mayan city, 
in the middle of the jungle with ready access from all sides. But sometime 
toward the end of the 8th Century, the inhabitants of Dos Pilas erected two 
concentric rings of walls around the center of the city, defacing monuments and 
burying important artifacts in their haste. 
</P>
<P>
Debris recovered from inside the walls indicates that large numbers of people 
inhabited the area at least briefly, suggesting that the city was under siege. 
When and how it fell, however, is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
But before it did, Ruler 2 apparently conquered a number of smaller fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest and his colleagues also discovered, but have only tentatively 
explored, an extensive series of caves near Dos Pilas that have not been 
entered by humans for more than 1,000 years. He believes that the caves may 
also have been used as a place of refuge during a siege. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the caves, they discovered ritual offerings of broken pots and flint 
knives, as well as the mummified remains of a boy who had been sacrificed and 
painted with red ocher. Exploring the unexpected caves "was one of the first 
times I've found myself irrationally exhilarated," Demarest said. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest's discoveries are so recent that few of his colleagues, aside from 
those on the expedition itself, are aware of them. One who has been informed is 
anthropologist Richard E. W. Adams of the University of Texas at San Antonio, 
who thinks Demarest's discoveries are "swell stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries, Adams said, "go a long way toward documenting in detail 
this whole business of warfare as an element in the collapse of the Mayan 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists' picture of the Mayan civilization has been gradually changing 
over the last 20 years. Historians of Mayan art, in particular, had begun to 
paint a picture of a more warlike population than had been previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan hieroglyphics show repeated images of warriors clad in jaguar pelts or 
bird-like costumes, bearing woven shields and lances, capturing the noble elite 
of nearby tribes and bringing them back to their own temples for ritualistic 
bloodletting, removal of their hearts and decapitation. 
</P>
<P>
But this war was sharply circumscribed. Mayan art shows no instances of cities 
under siege, temples ransacked, or any of the other depredations of large-scale 
conflict. Instead, the fighting seems to be representative more of a rite of 
passage for prestige than an actual combat for resources or plunder. 
</P>
<P>
But about AD 825, Adams said, "something went terribly wrong" and kings like 
Ruler 2 began actual conquest of nearby cities and settlements. By the middle 
of that century, Dos Pilas had extended its hegemony to cover an area of nearly 
690 square miles -- a huge amount of land in comparison to the areas controlled 
by other Mayan cities -- before it ultimately collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"But if one group changes the rules (of warfare), other groups have to adopt 
the new rules and you get a kind of arms race," Demarest said. "Intensification 
of warfare spreads by contagion, and the ultimate result can be regional 
devastation. In this case, the Dos Pilas hegemony broke up into heavily 
fortified sites, small independent states warring rather savagely with each 
other. It may not be the principal cause of the collapse of the Mayan 
civilization, but it is certainly a principal cause."

EVANGELICAL CHURCH, CATHOLICS COMPETE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Native Religions  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the last decade, Catholic missionaries have worked hard to help the
Indians combine elements of their traditional religion with Catholic teaching
to convert the Mayans, who make up nearly half of the country's 9 million
people.;    Religion is just one of the forces working to change the Indians
in Guatemala, one of the largest indigenous populations in all of Latin
America.;    Political turmoil and violence have plagued Guatemala since the
mid-1950s and Indians have often been caught between warring factions fighting
for control of territory and the population. The incursion of modern
communications also has aided the erosion of Indian culture. Many of the most
remote villages now have TV satellite dishes; North American-style programs
and advertising are becoming a regular part of community life.;    The
Catholic effort to incorporate Mayan culture in its worship is being countered
by the recent surge of evangelical Christians in Guatemala who regard the
ancient religious practices as pagan.;    Those who study the Maya say the
effort by Catholics to blend religious practices and the zealous proselytizing
by growing evangelical groups are whittling away at the Indians' traditional
lifestyles.;    "Ethnic diversity is in danger of dying out in this decade,"
said Samuel Franco, owner of an indigenous music museum in Antigua. "The
traditional Indian religious music played by marimbas and wood flutes is
rarely played any more. The religious dances by masked dancers are rarely
performed.";    The period before Easter has become a stark reminder of how
the modern age and the pull of different missionaries has begun to unravel the
Indian culture.;    During Holy Week in the village of Santiago Atitlan, for
instance, hundreds of Mayans offer cheap rum, cigars and new clothes to the
wood statue "saint" they call Maximon, a combination wise man, healer and
judge.;    In earlier times, Mayans by the thousands, dressed in traditional
garb and playing wooden flutes and drums, used to flock to this village to
venerate Maximon. This week, only a few hundred showed up, wearing jeans and
T-shirts, listening to cassette tapes of Mayan music.;    Bishop Efrain
Hernandez, secretary to Guatemalan Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrios,
says the Catholic Church is not trying to destroy indigenous beliefs, but
simply mix two ways of thinking.;    The Catholic Church has tried so hard to
accept Mayan behavior that it has come increasingly under fire by evangelicals
who say Catholics are ignoring black magic ceremonies, including the sacrifice
of chickens, and the use of liquor at celebrations honoring Indian saints.;   
"We have a strong movement among the Indians and their actions are pagan.
That's a fact," said Edmundo Madrid, president of Guatemala's Evangelical
Alliance. "We are trying to stop the rituals. They do all kinds of image
worshiping and believe in animism. The Catholics try to unite everything, but
what they are doing is not Christian."  </TEXT>

   Two decades ago, under a previous administration, scandal marred
the museum's centennial when customs agents impounded a Raphael
portrait smuggled out of Italy.
   The museum, which has one of the finest Egyptology collections
outside Cairo, can well afford to return the Theban mud paintings,
but Shestack wonders out loud what he and other museum directors
might do ``if faced with the loss of a piece worth maybe millions.
Perhaps I'd try to work out some sort of quid pro quo arrangement,
swapping something of equivalent value or negotiating a long-term
loan.''
   Despite new laws and treaties to protect Central America's
cultural riches, Mayan curator Ian Graham at Harvard's Peabody
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology knows from experience that the
soaring world market in pre-Columbian art has made looters more
daring and better equipped, with all-terrain vehicles, X-ray devices
and stratigraphic drills. They are also becoming more violent.
   For 30 years Graham has ventured into the rain forests of
Guatemala each February, when the rainy season ends, to study a
civilization whose art and architecture rivaled that of ancient
Egypt. But now the race is on against armed gangs of ``esteleros,''
tomb robbers, to record the few hundred surviving Mayan stelae,
those magnificent 7-foot limestone tablets inscribed with
hieroglyphics found at the bases of temples and pyramids.
   ``Looters are busier and more brazen than ever,'' lamented Graham
in an interview at the Peabody. ``Sometimes the political unrest in
the area comes as a blessing. Army patrols with machine guns
searching for guerrillas in the rain forests scare off the more
vicious gangs.''
   Several years ago Graham's small research team was ambushed by
robbers at an archaelogical site in Guatemala's Peten region. One of
his assistants was fatally shot in the back.
   His work has since been interrupted by sporadic gunfire, but
Graham thinks a worse crime is cutting up these stupendous slabs
into slices a mule can carry across the border into Belize for
illicit export to eager buyers.
   ``Just removing them from where they stood for 1,000 years robs
them of much of the story they have to tell,'' says Graham. In his
own writing he indicts ``a different breed of go-go museum
directors, more entrepreneurs than scholars, and collectors, mostly
ignorant of history but motivated by profit,'' for encouraging a
soaring art theft trade that employs a work force of several hundred
thousand around the world. Some law enforcement officers rank it
second only to the drug traffic in cash flow.
   Graham also charges that U.S. income tax laws allowing inflated
write-offs for museum donations reward pillage and piracy. Mayan
stelae have found their way into museums in Washington, D.C.,
Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, St. Louis, Chicago, Zurich, Berlin,
Cologne and many others.
   University of Pennsylvania archaeologist George Bass, an early
advocate of museum codes, once pinpointed the ethical dilemma in a
scholarly report: ``The clandestine excavator and antiquities
smuggler are criminals to be abhorred; museums and private
collectors who encourage their illegal work are held in high
esteem.''
   Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan, told a
conference of museum directors that the explosion in smuggled art
was ``the most serious issue facing the profession.'' This did not
deter him two years later from acquiring the sixth century B.C.
Euphronios krater, ``the finest Greek vase there is,'' for a
reported $1 million cash and $300,000 in ancient gold coins.
   Hoving, dubbed ``The Grand Acquisitor'' for the $300 million he
spent adding to the Metropolitan's vast collections, denied the vase
was a ``hot pot'' and insisted it had been in the hands of ``a
private European collector since World War I'' whose name could not
be divulged.
   Dietrich von Bothmer, the museum's curator of Greek and Roman
art, was met with open derision when he added vague details of its
purchase in Zurich from an Armenian living in Beirut who was moving
to Australia for tax purposes.
   ``Why not an Eskimo moving to Florida?'' scoffed a New England
curator.
   Museum curators have long argued that such acquisitions preserve
precious art for the enrichment of the public and keep it from
disappearing into private collections or Swiss bank vaults.
   Dealers and collectors similarly insist they are saving
antiquities not appreciated in their land of origin from rotting in
the jungle or, as in the case of Mayan temples in the Yucatan and
even the Great Wall of China, being used as building blocks by
developers.
   Peasants digging into ancient ruins need food for their families,
so why not pay them for finding a Cretan amphora or an Indian bowl
that might otherwise wind up under a plow or a shopping mall?
   Besides, in a business where forged documents have long been a
way of life, too scrupulous a stand on acquisitions will only drive
the best archaeological loot into the booming markets of Japan,
where pre-Columbian art is rapidly replacing French impressionists
as a status symbol and a gilt-edged investment.

<TEXT>
   Scientists are studying the
traditional Mayan medicine still practiced by thousands of Indians
in Mexico's southern highlands, some of whom speak to the gods from
sacred hilltops.
   There are yerberos, or experts in medicinal herbs; parteras, or
midwives and pediatricians; pulsadores, who diagnose by reading the
pulse, and hueseros, who set bones and act as the rough equivalent
of chiropracters.
   Most exalted are the curanderos, also called shamans or rezadores
de los cerros: those who know how to speak to the gods.
   Among them is Sebastian Gonzalez, who lives in Chamula, a town in
the highlands of Chiapas state near the Guatemala frontier.
   ``My grandfather was a curandero amd I've been a curandero since
I was 8 years old, when I began to dream about people with big
baskets of flowers,'' said Gonzalez, 48.
   Those dreams led a pulsador to declare that the boy was a
curandero. At first Gonzalez worked with candles, a key element of
religious ceremonies that mix ancient pantheism with the Roman
Catholicism brought by Spanish conquerors.
   ``When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I began to ask my
grandfather about plants,'' Gonzalez said.
   Dr. Brent Berlin, a linguistic anthropologist from the University
of California at Berkeley, leads a joint U.S.-Mexican project to
compile an encyclopedia of contemporary Mayan medicine in several
languages, including Tzotzil, which is spoken in Chamula.
   ``If you could look inside a Mayan Indian's head, about 80
percent is going to have something to do with the world of plants,''
he said. ``They are very close to the earth. These people have been
agriculturalists for thousands of years.''
   Herbal medicine is taken seriously in Mexico. People in all walks
of life and every part of the country use the cures.
   Government health agencies enlist the aid of practitioners and
are studying the plants many of them use.
   Gonzalez, president of the state Organization of Indigenous
Doctors, says about 7,000 curanderos practice in Chiapas. He said he
has learned how to use about 300 medicinal plants, each of which has
special rules for preparation and use.
   ``There are plants that can't be picked by men; there are plants
that can't be picked by women,'' he explained. ``There are plants
that must be used dry and others that must be used fresh.''
   He said the compass points are important when a shaman prays on a
sacred hilltop.
   A curandero known as Don Antonio said he made his reputation in
1926, at age 19 or 20, after a villager was hit by a truck and
suffered a nosebleed that would not stop. Don Antonio said he
stopped it after a week with tree bark and prayers.
   A grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation in late 1986
allowed Berlin to start the ambitious project of cataloging
contemporary Mayan medicine and its array of herbs.
   Researchers have collected 1,500 species of medicinal plants and
identified 98 percent of them, Berlin said, and compiled the Mayan
names of almost 200 illnesses.
   He discourages the notion that miracle cures will be found and
said his team is not yet investigating active properties of the
plants.
   ``That's the second stage,'' he said. ``First you have to find
out what people think'' causes the cure.
   Some interesting discoveries have been made, however. Berlin said
solanum lancioflorium, an herb commonly called sosa, was found to
contain an antibiotic.
   Traditional medicine has a valid role, Berlin said, especially
among people like the Indians of Chiapas. He described them as a
``Fourth World population that does not have access to the
resources, the assets of the rest of Mexican society.''
   He pointed out that Mayan medicine does not involve expensive
doctors and the herbs are easily obtainable, either free or
inexpensive.
   ``This knowledge of the medicinal properties of the flora is
widely shared by the community,'' he said. ``What's not shared is
how to talk to the gods.''
   Modern and Mayan medicine have different definitions of diseases
and their causes, as well as different cures.
   ``The greatest dissimilarities are when the diagnosis is not
based on symptoms but on ideology,'' Berlin said.
   A physician might blame an ailment on a virus, he said, while a
shaman would trace it to an offense by the patient against the gods
or the ``evil eye'' of an enemy.

MESOAMERICA AND INTIMACY WITH NATURE

<TEXT>
<P>
It takes quite a mental leap to enter the world of ancient Mesoamerica from our 
contemporary, urban cocoon. The shift in sensibilities is dramatic and may even 
evoke some surprising jealousies if one contrasts today's techno-efficient 
mind-set with the sturdy spiritual and aesthetic scaffolding that framed 
Mesoamerican culture. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty and integrity of the work in the Mingei International Museum's 
current show, "Precolumbian Flora and Fauna: Continuity of Plant and Animal 
Themes in Mesoamerican Art," help make that mental leap inviting. Once 
transported, the ingenuity of form and depth of belief so abundant in the show 
can both nourish and instruct the mindful viewer. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit (through Feb. 17) does more than offer a rich survey of painted, 
carved and modeled animal and plant forms from present-day Mexico and its 
southern neighbors. It reminds us of what we have lost and may never recapture: 
a cycle of respect among the species, an interdependence that ensures mutual 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
The Mingei show focuses on the continuity of certain motifs and belief systems 
across Precolumbian cultures, but the work itself speaks more of distinction, 
of individuals' creativity, their endless, marvelous permutations on familiar 
forms and functional objects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the show and its well-illustrated catalogue are divided into four 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
The first three represent the three tiers of the Precolumbian cosmos -- air, 
earth and underworld -- and the final section presents contemporary examples of 
thematically related folk art from the Mesoamerica region. 
</P>
<P>
"Precolumbian man used animals to understand and order natural phenomena," 
explains guest curator Jeanette Favrot Peterson in her catalogue essay. 
</P>
<P>
"Ancient societies structured their world view using plant and animal 
metaphors; they endowed their deities with powers symbolized by fauna and 
flora; their ruling elite borrowed from nature those characteristics they 
wished to emulate and control." Hence, when a Mayan ruler wore a waterlily 
insignia, the flower's associations with agricultural canals and the watery 
underworld bestowed power to the ruler over fertility and the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Tight visual and conceptual links bound the earth to its occupants in 
Precolumbian culture, which spanned roughly 3,000 years, from about 1,500 B.C. 
up to the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. The crocodile, for example, was 
one of several fish-like creatures that came to symbolize the earthly realm, 
for it floated on water, just like land, resting atop the fluid underworld. 
Further, the patterns on the backs of crocodiles, turtles and toads were 
compared to the geometric patterns of tilled fields. And the snake's shedding 
of its skin each year came to represent the Earth's own seasonal renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitivity to the form, texture and behavior of animals ran high among the 
Olmec, Maya and Aztec cultures, and the candor and energy of the animal figures 
here bear witness to the artists' close observation as well as his belief in 
the animals' spiritual power. A clay monkey effigy (550-800 A.D.) with a 
sacrificial rope around its neck wears an expression of uncanny honesty, as if 
aware of the higher meaning bestowed upon his life and death as purveyor of 
creativity and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs, though domesticated, were also eaten and offered as sacrifices to the 
gods in ancient Mesoamerica, which comprised Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, 
most of Mexico and parts of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Most of the 
canine figures capture the animal's frisky, friendly nature, nuzzling into 
another's neck, gnawing on a bone, or squirming on its back, with legs poking 
up into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to depict essences of form and character overshadow any concern for 
detailed representation. Forms are often simplified and generalized. This 
paring down not only heightens the vitality of the forms but lends them 
integrity as abstract design, a fact not lost on such early 20th-Century 
modernists as Picasso and Braque. 
</P>
<P>
Form and function meld gracefully in vessels whose openings double as dog 
tails, or whose handles are formed by the arching body of a bird. In one Mayan 
vessel of buff clay, a cylindrical base incised with delicate patterns supports 
a horizontal fish. The vessel's opening, a large round hole in the creature's 
belly, echoes the shape of the fish's bulging eye and is subtly framed by the 
arch of its fins. 
</P>
<P>
The show concludes with a small selection of masks, vessels and ritual objects 
from contemporary Mexico and Central America. Native beliefs have persisted, 
despite the Spanish imposition of Christianity in the 16th Century, and the 
continuity of themes and motifs during Precolumbian times still holds today.

Once home to elegant restaurants and apartments, the streets of the Pico-Union 
District are now tired and unkept. Wrought iron guards many of the storefronts 
and weeds have overrun the spaces that concrete and trash have missed. 
</P>
<P>
It's a stark contrast to the lush green mountains and verdant countryside of 
Central America, yet the neighborhood has become home to the greatest 
concentration of Salvadorans outside El Salvador and the largest number of 
Guatemalans outside Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
These refugees, victims of war and poverty, plant their dreams in the cement 
and hope for the best. For Samuel Simon, the ground has proved fertile. 
</P>
<P>
"Here there are many opportunities, and if I put my mind to it, I can succeed," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
In Simon's homeland, Guatemala, the outlook was much bleaker. A Mayan Indian, 
Simon watched a succession of governments rob his people of their language, 
tradition and culture before fleeing 3 1/2 years ago in advance of a forced 
recruitment sweep by the army. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I left," he says, "is fear." 
</P>
<P>
And among the reasons he stays is culture. Although Mayan customs have been 
forcibly repressed in Guatemala since the time of the Spanish Conquest, they 
have found a home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
IXIM, the center for the integration of indigenous Mayas, was founded more than 
a decade ago to promote the community development and cultural expression of 
Maya refugees. IXIM (pronounced ee-SHEEM) takes its name from the Mayan word 
for corn, which, according to folk tradition, was the substance used by the 
Gods to create the first Mayans. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, 24, is the secretary of IXIM as well as the director of the center's 
most visible component, its marimba band. The group will perform as part of the 
Los Angeles Festival on Sunday, from 12:45 p.m. until 1:30 next to the La 
Placita church in Olvera Street, and again from 3 until 5 p.m. at Union 
Station. Both concerts are free. 
</P>
<P>
Although descendants of the ancient Mayan civilizations are often lumped 
together, they represent 23 distinct groups and 100 dialects in Guatemala 
alone. The majority of Mayans in Los Angeles speak languages of the 
Q'anjob'alan subfamily, which dominates the highland regions of the Department 
of Huehuetenango. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, a Kanjobal Mayan, comes from the city of Santa Eulalia in western 
Huehuetenango, less than 30 miles from the Mexican border. There he worked as a 
teacher, a profession that earned him the respect of his people and the 
suspicion of his government. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a campaign to knock off the Indians' leaders . . . the teachers and 
such," says Father James Curtain, the Catholic priest who founded IXIM in 1979 
after more than three decades of work among the indigenous peoples of 
Guatemala. Curtain, 71, now lives at the Maryknoll Residence in Los Altos, 
south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Indians are considered subversives by the military," Curtain said. 
"There is general repression against the Indians." 
</P>
<P>
The repression turned to genocide under the military rule of generals Romeo 
Lucas Garcia (1978-82) and Efrain Rios Montt (1982-83), who unleashed a brutal 
counterinsurgency campaign in the countryside. Ostensibly, it was intended to 
give the army the upper hand in its long war against anti-government 
guerrillas. But in reality, it led to the massacre of more than 50,000 
indigenous Guatemalans and forced hundreds of thousands more into exile, 
according to a study by a branch of the Guatemalan Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional culture has also been a casualty of war. Out of fear, many Mayan 
women no longer wear the traditional and colorful huipil dresses, which reveal 
their Indian roots. And children are taught Spanish at home rather than their 
native dialect to help them blend in. 
</P>
<P>
According to Curtain, that leaves most indigenous Guatemalans "stuck in a kind 
of in-between place -- afraid to be recognized as an Indians, but not accepted 
by the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big job," he said, "is to get them to be proud of their culture and their 
heritage. To be proud of what they are. To preserve their culture." 
</P>
<P>
It's a task Samuel Simon has accepted with fervor. The son of a musician, Simon 
learned to play marimba at the age of 6. That talent, combined with his skill 
as a teacher, made Simon the obvious choice to teach and direct IXIM's five 
marimbistas. 
</P>
<P>
The marimba -- as common in highland Guatemala as a piano or guitar in the 
United States -- has an important place in Mayan tradition. For centuries it 
has been central to both religious and social celebrations. In areas such as 
Huehuetenango, where 85% of the people are descendants of the Maya, marimba 
bands have traditionally traveled from town to town to play in local fiestas. 
If the band is good, the status of its villages grows; if a band is bad, the 
village can be disgraced. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's village, Santa Eulalia, is a hotbed for marimba players, among them 
Simon's father. But like most Guatemalan marimbistas, Simon never learned to 
read music. Instead, he plays by ear, learning new tunes by memorizing the 
music from cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a gift I have," he says. "Here, I don't have many other interests. 
Playing the marimba is the only thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Simon has precious little time to devote to his music. Like the other 
members of IXIM's band, he works every day but Sunday in a garment district 
shop where, in a good week, he will make $200. He also spends two nights a week 
at a trade school studying to be a radio announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Simon already has a radio show of his own, broadcasting in Spanish twice weekly 
to parts of San Bernardino and Riverside. Ironically, the commercial music he 
plays on the radio is one of the obstacles he says immigrants face in trying to 
preserve their culture in a new country. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes modernization changes the roots of a culture," he says. "It would be 
similar to us forgetting our culture. But with (IXIM), it's different because 
we practice our culture like it was before. We change nothing. It's important 
that we conserve the Mayan and Kanjobal culture so that people can know it." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, who fled Guatemala with his uncle and entered this country illegally, 
lives with six other men in a small house in the shadow of the Harbor Freeway. 
His immediate future depends on the outcome of his political asylum request, 
which is still pending with the INS. The odds for a favorable review, however, 
are long -- less than 3% of those Guatemalans seeking political asylum won 
their cases last year, despite overwhelming evidence that government-sponsored 
repression continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse," Curtain says. "Anybody that protests against what's going on is 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more ominous is the fact that retired general Rios Montt, an architect 
of the Mayan holocaust, is running for the presidency as a civilian. Elections 
are scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
With prospects for the future so dim, it would seem difficult to remain 
optimistic. Yet Simon, displaying a stoicism typical of the Mayans, says he has 
few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made many sacrifices, but I have everything," he says. "I feel much 
stronger about my culture here than there. I feel more Kanjobal. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more possibilities here to practice my culture. There are 
possibilities here than I ever knew existed. 
</P>
<P>
"If the INS gives my asylum, I'll stay. If not, I'll go back."

<HEAD>Authorities Recover Priceless Artifacts Stolen From National Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have recovered scores of priceless
jade, gold and stone artifacts taken in the 1985 Chistmas Day
robbery of the National Museum of Anthropology, the federal attorney
general's office said.
   Federal agents found 133 of the 140 stolen treasures from the
ancient Mayan, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations in canvas
sacks stashed in a home in suburban Mexico City, the daily Excelsior
said.
   It said 10 people were arrested.
   The story was confirmed Sunday by an agent at the attorney
general's office. The agent, who requested anonymity, said experts
were authenticating the artifacts prior to an official announcement.
   The artifacts were recovered Saturday during a series of raids on
several residences in Mexico City, Excelsior said. It said Deputy
Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo, head of the narcotics
enforcement division, led the raids.
   Among the items recovered were a Zapotec mask of the bat god
Murielago and an obsidian Aztec sculpture of a monkey. Experts have
described them as two of the most valuable pieces in a museum
crammed with irreplaceable objects from civilizations dating back
thousands of years.
   Excelsior said the suspects arrested Saturday include two
brothers identified as the masterminds of the crime that stunned the
nation and led to an international search for the treasures looted
from seven display cases early Dec. 25, 1985.
   Many of the artifacts came from such important archeological
sites as Palenque in southern Mexico and Chicen-Itza on the Yucatan
Peninsula.
   Excelsior said authorities believe the loot has been in the same
place, a house in an affluent middle-class neighborhood called
Satellite, since it was stolen. Officials have long maintained that
many of the items were too well-known to be sold on the open market
and that they were still in Mexico.
   Excelsior said the recovered artifacts include a famous Mayan
turquoise mosaic, a Mixtec gold and conch shell necklace and several
other pieces of jewelry. It did not say anything about the seven
items that were not recovered.

STOLEN CONTINENTS: THE INDIAN STORY by Roland Wright John Murray Pounds
19.95, 424 pages
'FOR FIVE centuries,' writes Roland Wright, 'we have listened only to the
history of the winners.' Stolen Continents redresses the balance by
portraying the European 'discovery' of the continents of North and South
America from a 'native' perspective.
In selecting the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, Iroquois and Cherokee, he has focused
on the most complex societies for whom the greatest source material is
available. 'The five I have chosen must therefore stand for the many who
will never tell their stories because they are extinct. The silence of the
Caribbean Taino, the Newfoundland Beothuk, and the Ona of Tierra del Fuego
is the most terrible eloquence of all.'
Wright portrays the history of these five groupings during three phases:
invasion, resistance, rebirth. The book is timely, not just because this
year marks the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage across the
Atlantic, but because Wright follows the story through to the vociferous
nationalism of today.
His account is passionate and moving. Through reconstruction of wide-ranging
primary sources the reader can relive the agonies of the original
inhabitants at the hands of the invaders. But whereas we may be accustomed
to the devrecounted in the sixteenth-century Florentine Code, the continued
persecution of the indigenous population comes as a surprise. The memoirs of
the Guatemalan Mayan activist Rigoberta Menchu, written in 1982, are so
horrific that Wright admits some people may not believe that such horrors
really happened.
Wright sees the superior European attitude towards the 'primitive' natives
as almost laughable were the consequences not so tragic. The 'Requirement'
read by the sixteenth-century Spaniards to the local people at each
encounter demanded they submit to God, the Pope and the Church. 'And if you
do not do this . . . with the help of God I shall come mightily against you,
and I shall make war on you everywhere . . . and I shall do all the evil and
damage to you that I am able. And insist that the deaths and destruction
that result from this will be your fault.' This 'shabby document', as Wright
points out, was a symbolic necessity to justify outright plunder. The
Indians understood neither its meaning nor its intent.
Apologists for the European 'invasion' rightly point out that what decimated
the local people was not so much warfare but European diseases. But Wright
stresses the consequences of Lord Jeffrey Amherst's command against the
Iroquois in 1762. 'Infect the Indians with sheets upon which smallpox
patients have been lying or by any other means which may serve to
exterminate this accursed race.' The epidemic raged all summer, says Wright.
'One by one the leaders who survived it were compelled to sue for peace.'
Whether he is talking about the Incas, Aztecs, Mayas, of South and
Mesoamerica, or the Cherokee and Iroquois of North America, the 'Indian
story' is a tawdry one of misunderstanding and betrayal. Time and again the
new arrivals in North America reneged on their treaty obligations with the
original inhabitants who had once made them welcome.
There never was any expectation that the 'white' and 'Indian' cultures might
coexist. Thousands of books of Mayan hieroglyphs were destroyed because the
Spaniards could not understand them. When finally the remaining few were
deciphered, they revealed advanced astronomical information. In their
attempt to eradicate the Inca culture, the Spaniards banned Ouecha song,
music and theatre. Even well-meant reforms backfired.
Although the title of the book indicates that the continents of North and
South America have been 'stolen' from their pre-Columbian inhabitants, the
reader is left in no doubt that 500 years later the 'theft' is still being
contested by those who have not lost sight of their ancient culture or
language. 'If Guatemala really had majority rule, it would be a Maya
republic,' says Wright. In the Andes 12m people speak the Inca language.
There are more Iroquois living in North America than there have been for
three and a half centuries. And the eastern Cherokees have managed to remain
in the Great Smoky mountains where they lived in pre-Columbian times.

<HEADLINE>  THE RITE STUFF
OPERA SAN JOSE WORKS TO TURN SACRED TEXTS, MODERN
MUSIC INTO AN OPERA OF THE CONTINENT BEFORE
COLUMBUS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Opera  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The scene is from a workshop presentation of an excerpt from "Popol Vuh," a
commissioned opera-in-progress, which could become the most ambitious project
attempted by Opera San Jose.;   With a score by prize-winning electronic
composer Allen Strange, a libretto by Robert Jenkins and choreography by David
A. Vargas, the 16-minute excerpt staged recently at San Jose State was as
visually stunning and exotic as anything in "Aida" or "L'Africaine.";   This
operatic pie-slice is decidedly unorthodox, using computer-generated music
throughout and no acoustic instruments.;   Composer Strange, a nationally
recognized San Jose State faculty member, had never written an opera before.
He ran across a translation of "Popol Vuh" in a bookstore -- misplaced in the
cooking section. He and librettist Jenkins approached Opera San Jose about
writing an opera based on the work.;   "I always thought of opera as
19th-century TV," he commented after accepting a commission to start on the
project.;   A number of listeners at the Aug. 22 presentation were so
impressed that they stayed to see a second run-through later the same evening
-- this, despite the use of the Central American texts, three languages, the
electronic score and some moments that seemed more like anthropology than
opera.;   Indeed, some accurately inflected Quiche-Mayan spoken texts had been
provided on audio tape by Stanford anthropology professor James Fox. They were
sprinkled in with the singing in English and Spanish.;   Opera San Jose has
taken a cautious approach to the project in this recession year. The company
gave the green light for the 16-minute workshop scene with makeup and
costumes. A grant of over $9,000 from the San Jose Fine Arts Commission was
seed money for the mini-production, whose costs were estimated at $14,000 in
cash and $30,000 in in-kind services.;   Opera San Jose videotaped the
workshop in order to interest potential contributors. The company has set an
August 1992 deadline for raising the "$80,000 to $100,000" needed for
completion of the libretto and score, according to executive director Craig
Palmer. Says Palmer, "This piece is at least three to four years away" from
the main stage.;   The basis of the libretto is the opening portion of "Popol
Vuh," the sacred book of the ancient Quiche Mayas, whose descendants still
survive in the highlands of Guatemala.;   The earliest written versions of
"Popol Vuh" were set down on scrolls in the mid-16th century by native priests
who feared that otherwise their indigenous tradition would be wiped out by the
Spanish conquistadors.;   The opera adaptation of "Popol Vuh" represents an
unusual attempt at an honest and historically informed portrayal of a tale
drawn from an indigenous American culture.;   Older operas were not nearly as
true to their historic sources. The two "Montezuma" operas by Karl Heinrich
Graun (1755) and Roger Sessions (1962) are rooted firmly in the European
operatic tradition. And two better-known works -- Purcell's "The Indian Queen"
(1694) and Offenbach's "La Perichole" (1868) -- are merely excuses for
European singers with thoroughly European scores to don exotic finery and play
out painfully implausible tales. Unlike "Popol Vuh," none of these is written
from the perspective of New World peoples.;   But despite the admirable
intentions, producer Daniel Helfgot had to overcome resistance when he sought
out dancers who could perform in the Aztec and Mayan traditions from the local
group Tezkatlipoka. "The dancers were suspicious," said Helfgot, an urbane
emigre from Buenos Aires and the only Latin American involved on the creative
team. "They wondered, 'What do these Caucasians want to do?' Now they have
joined us. But we are sensitive to them.";   Asked about the possibility of
offending the surviving descendants of the Quiche Mayas, librettist Jenkins
said, "I've worried a lot over it. . . . (Therefore) we're staying as close as
possible to the sacred text.";   Apart from this problem, there's also a
question of how well the stories will translate to the operatic stage. To this
critic, the excerpt at San Jose State offered more color than drama. The
decision to stick closely to the Mayan codex appears to be pushing the work
toward ceremony and away from plot development and a strong set of central
characters. Most of the scene played like something akin to Pharaonic rites or
a religious service.;   Baroque composers faced a similar quandary in dealing
with sacred texts. The prolific opera composer Handel put his Biblical works
into oratorio (concert) form rather than opera. Bach created his Passions for
use in the church rather than on the stage; modern-day operatic stagings of
his great "St. Matthew's Passion" have not met with favor, despite repeated
attempts.;   Still, it's clear that Opera San Jose has made great strides,
demonstrating its excellent production skills even in the bare-bones San Jose
State Studio Theater. The ensemble had done its homework, and the presentation
had integrity.;   As for theatricality, the overrunning of the Mayan religious
rites by the conquistadors in one portion provided a vivid if melodramatic
touch.;   While the fund-raising effort goes on, the Opera San Jose creative
team, from artistic director Irene Dalis to conductor Barbara Day Turner to
choreographer David A. Vargas, are hoping enough backers will be found to make
the opera happen.;   Composer Strange, meanwhile, has musical sketches galore,
with five discs of computer-synthesized flute music alone.;   "With
computer-generated music, every minute (performed) takes about 18 hours of
work" by the composer, Strange says. "And that isn't much different than
traditional composing (for voice and orchestra).";   If this project catches
on, and the entire five-volume set of sacred writings of the Quiche Mayas were
to be turned into opera, Strange's score would make Richard Wagner's epic
"Ring" cycle look like a minuet. If dramatized at the current rate, the entire
set would entail well in excess of 60 hours of music.;   Now that would be an
opera to remember. (box)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Prehistoric American civilizations were not
built by transplanted Egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts,
says archaeologist Wilburn ``Sonny'' Cockrell of Florida State
University.
   The origin of the mound builders of North America and the
pyramid and city dwellers of Central and South America is explored
on ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' on public television
Wednesday night.
   ``A number of people, particularly in this century, have come to
an almost racist view of the American Indians,'' said Cockrell.
``They look at the high civilizations these ancient people built,
at their complex cultures and monumental achievements, and refuse
to accept that they were American aboriginals.
   ``Popular writers from the 18th century on looked at the mounds,
at the Anasazi pueblos in New Mexico, at the ruins of cities in
Central and South America and said they must have been built by
some vanished race. Later writers came up with the notion of
Egyptians and ancient astronauts.''
   Cockrell says the early Americans crossed a land bridge that
connected Asia and western North America in the Ice Age.
   ``Due to the mile-thick continental glaciers, the oceans were
300 feet lower, allowing these first immigrants to enter the New
World,'' Cockrell said in a telephone interview from Warm Mineral
Springs, Fla., where he is director for FSU's archaeological
research project.
   ``There were several waves of immigrants, and this show depicts
what scientists know about these people and their descendants. We
survey them over a wide geographic range and over a long temporal
range and look into questions as to why particular cultural
manifestations arose and why they disappeared.''
   The one-hour documentary is part of ``The Infinite Voyage''
series and will appear later on some commercial stations. The show
is a joint venture of PBS and the National Academy of Sciences and
was produced by WQED-TV in Pittsburgh.
   Cockrell is serving as spokesman for the show, although he
appears on the broadcast only in sequences about his project,
recovering the 12,000-year-old remains and artifacts of
Paleo-Indians from a sink hole.
   ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' will be followed in
subsequent weeks by reruns of four shows from last season.
   ``The celestial observations of the native Americans,
specifically Central Americans, were more sophisticated and had
greater accuracy than those of Western civilization,'' he said.
``Their understanding of astronomical events and the
interrelationship of celestial movements extends back at least one
millennium before the birth of Christ and probably earlier.
   ``They had the concept of the zero before Westerners. The
Post-Classic Mayans had libraries full of books called codices
which extensively documented Mayan culture. These libraries were
destroyed by the Spanish, who assumed that since these Indians
weren't Christian their ability to read and write was in conflict
with the Spanish concept of God.''
   The documentary ranges from the now-submerged land bridge
between Siberia and Alaska to the jungle-covered pyramids in
Central America. The trek of the first immigrants from Asia is
re-created by a group of Native Americans.
   The program then moves ahead to Warm Mineral Springs, where
Cockrell heads the archaeologists and paleontologists recovering
remains of the Paleo-Indians. Inland from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
another FSU group led by Dr. Glen Doran is shown excavating a
7,000-year-old cemetery from the Archaic period.
   ``The recovery of the skeleton of a 16-year-old male who
suffered from spina bifida indicates that the people were
compassionate and economically stable enough to care for a helpless
member of their group throughout his life,'' he said.
   The show then goes to Chaco Canyon, N.M., where National Park
Service archaeologists and their colleagues are looking into the
complex civilization of the vanished Anasazi culture.
   ``Archaeologists are careful to use the term culture,'' said
Cockrell. ``People don't vanish, but cultures vanish. People live
on but adopt or become participants in other cultures. It's rare
that an entire population vanishes, such as the concept of Atlantis
falling into the sea.
   ``The civilization of Atlantis did not vanish into the sea. The
myth refers to the dissolution of the culture of the Minoan Crete,
probably by the eruption of a volcano. The people remained to
become the inhabitants of the Greek islands and classical Greece.''
   Cockrell said non-profit educational institutions are encouraged
to videotape the show. The Digital Equipment Corp. has distributed
25,000 teaching guides to schools.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Marvellous monsters from Mexico - From the Oltecs to
Frida Kahlo, Patricia Morison finds them all in Belgium at the Europalia 93
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM Antwerp to Zonhoven, cultural events with a Mexican accent spatter the
map of Belgium from now until Christmas. Mexico in Europe is the title of
Europalia 93. Events span the conventional arts and go beyond to include
horsemanship, numismatics, literature (presided over by Octavio Paz and
Carlos Fuentes), and papel picado or paper-cutting. Free to all comers is an
seven-day linguistics seminar on Mexican Spanish at Antwerp.
But what is Europalia? The unkind answer would be, a Belgian arts festival
which leaves the French cold and blank looks from most culturally aware
Britons. Yet Europalia has quite a pedigree. It was set up in 1969 as a
non-profit making, multi-disciplinary biennial arts festival to provide a
cultural window onto the member states of the EC. In 1989, it drew 1,660,000
visitors. A measure of devolution has crept in and events now spill over to
Maastricht, Rotterdam, even Paris.
Certain EC countries have yet to take the stage - Luxemburg for one, Ireland
for another. In 1989, Portugal declined on grounds of expense (her turn came
in 1991). The foundation's invitation to Japan threw Europalia open to all
comers; Scandinavia and Turkey currently contend for the 1995 slot.
Staging Europalia is not cheap. Belgium covers all costs within the country,
the guest nation pays the rest. This year, Mexico's costs were approximately
Dollars 20 million while Belgium's were roughly half, which is the standard
proportion. Where formerly there was a plethora of sponsors, this year, in
addition to the National Lottery, the Belgian end has six 'structural'
sponsors, each contributing BFr10 million: Alcatel Bell, Batiments et Ponts
Construction, Bekaert, Belgacom, Generale de Banque, and Swift.
So much for the Europalian nuts and bolts. In my own area of the visual
arts, Mexico has fielded some sumptuous exhibitions and others which sound
promising but I had no time to see. Sinister and heavy with the reek of
blood, Mayan archaeology is the festival's glory. Two large exhibitions must
be seen; The Eagle and the Sun, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts until December
19, and Maya-Metropolis at the Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in
Cinquantenaire Park until December 24.
A statue out of a nightmare, lifesize on a high plinth, stands guardian to
'The Eagle and the Sun'. It is made out of modelled and cast sections of
blackish-red like a ghastly mechanical toy. A human torso and legs balance
on feet with triple talons curved upwards. The face and huge ears of this
god of Oaxaca are clearly those of a bat. With its gaping mouth and four
great canine teeth, there seems every reason to believe that the three clay
bells on its neck sounded the death-knell for human sacrifices.
'Anthropomorphised mouse, Zapotec culture' is as far as the label goes and
the catalogue, beautifully photographed though it is, is not much more
informative. This is not an exhibition which seems to want to instruct its
public nor is it stylishly displayed. Yet despite this, the show is a
memorable introduction to pre-Columbian art.
It aims to be more, the theme being 3,000 years of Mexican art from the
Oltecs (1200-600 BC) to Frida Kahlo. However, Mexico after its conquest by
Hernan Cortes in 1521, is on the whole only thinly evoked with certain
exceptions from New Spain. My favourites were a remarkable 17th-century
painted genealogy of the family of Mendoza Moctezuma and four paintings by
Miguel Cabrera in the genre of scenes illustrating New Spain's rigid caste
system.
The pre-Columbian rooms are surely where you will want to linger. More than
100 pieces have been sent by museums all over Mexico, for the most part
sculptures, some of them large and of superb quality. A number of the best
pieces stand free of glass cases like the vampire-god, which increases the
almost palpable air of menace.
Many figures peer through rings strangely like spectacles or have skin
welted by snaking cicatrices. Some of the more human creatures sit on the
ground, cross-legged or hunched. Warriors, priests, or victims, they serve
gods who stand four-square under their plumed head-dresses displaying the
emblems of divinity, eagles, serpents, the skulls which to this day are
omnipresent in Mexican folk-art.
A statue of a god of the Totonacs clasps a severed head by a handle as if it
were his handbag. He comes from the Gulf of Mexico and belongs to the
centuries equivalent to Europe's Gothic age. To form a picture of which
peoples were active when, Maya-Metropolis is the far and away the better
show, a survey of the Mayan city-states from the Yucatan to the Nicaraguan
frontier in the classical and post-classical period (200-1500AD).
The aim is to show how distinct these city-states were. Anyone not reading
French (or Dutch) is at a disadvantage although the show has a a clear
lay-out. Essentially it is one large space mapped chronologically into
city-states - Bonampak, Jaina, Chichen Itza, Palenque, and so on. Stylish
design puts stepped details and turquoise decoration everywhere to suggest
Mayan temples.
Astonishing and even beautiful things are in the show. Highly carved
figurines from Jaina, the island necropolis, have jointed limbs and
detachable shields for the warriors, like Action Man dolls, as well as
figures such as old women and hunchbacks who have much to tell
archaeologists about Mayan society. Here is the show to discover the Mayans'
incredible skill at using primitive means to carve obsidian and jade.
The catalogue, clear and readable, will give you the latest from the bloody
Mayan battlefield, whether the hieroglyphs really can be read (yes is the
answer). My world is the richer for learning that jade comes from Spanish
for 'stone of the kidneys', ijada, because the conquerors followed Mexican
practice in taking powdered jade as a medicine. No doubt that was the fate
of many fabulously carved necklaces such as stout Cortes gave his marquesa
on their betrothal. See also the very fine pre-Columbian rooms at the
Cinquantenaire museum which reopened last week after four years.
A smaller exhibition I liked is Crucible of Hope at the BBL headquarters,
place Royal 6. A survey of Mexican history from 1810 to 1910, it surveys a
century of revolution. The Belgian link is poignantly presented, less in the
person of Empress Charlotte who, I learnt, was an insanely ambitious woman
who forced poor Maximilian to accept the throne, than in the story of the
Belgian volunteers who left from Oudenaarde to defend their princess.
Ghent has a superb exhibition of silver, mostly religious, from New Spain in
the fine new galleries of the Museum vor Sierkunst; and shows elsewhere
explore popular art through masks, Day of the Dead paraphernalia, and the
muralists. For a Europalia catalogue, ring 071 629 0230.

<HL> How Grave Looter At a Mexican Site Drools Over Relics --- Archaeologists Chase Him From Old Olmec Ruins; The Big Illicit Art Trade </HL>
<AUTHOR> Jonathan Kandell (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> LATAM </CO>
<DATELINE> COPALILLO, Mexico  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this isolated valley where peasants furrow their cornfields with mule-drawn wooden plows, archaeologists are unearthing a cradle of ancient Mexican civilization -- an Olmec settlement that flourished between 1200 and 600 B.C. 

   Pablo Morales got here before them. 
For two years, he and several confederates looted the site, making off with a trove of figurines that they sold to private collectors. 
But the grave robber was chased from the site in 1983, when the Mexican government got wind of the momentous find and took charge of the zone. 

   Now, Mr. Morales is on a furtive return visit. 
As he stands atop a large burial mound that is still sealed, his larcenous instincts are stirring. 
"The Olmec chieftains were buried with their most valuable possessions," says Mr. Morales, arms across his chest, mimicking a corpse clutching its earthly goods. 
"Just think of it -- idols, pottery, jewelry, a treasure under our feet." 

   Mr. Morales is back by invitation of this reporter. 
We have cut a deal: I have government permission to visit Copalillo, about 150 miles south of Mexico City. 
He has agreed to be my guide and enlighten me about the illicit -- and thriving -- trade in art treasures. 

   But Copalillo alone isn't enough of a lure for the wily grave robber. 
After some haggling, I agree to buy a piece he says he has looted from another site, a small, delicately sculpted duck, which he attributes to the Totonacas, a 13th-century tribe from Veracruz on the Gulf Coast. 
I plan to donate it to the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. 
The purchase sets me back $150. 

   Deals like this one have helped swell the illicit world trade in art treasures to about $1 billion a year, according to the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, a U.S. government-administered agency. 
U.S. and Mexican laws bar the smuggling of pre-Columbian objects. 
But many other nations, among them France, West Germany, Britain and Japan, would welcome such treasures. 

   Museum officials, archaeologists and dealers say many relics continue to be sold in the U.S., only more surreptitiously. 
Unscrupulous dealers do a busy trade in their back offices and apartments. 
It is easy enough to falsify papers claiming these antiquities were held for decades by collectors in Europe. 

   "Not long ago, we were offered a first-rate, ancient Egyptian relief," recalls Thomas Seligman, deputy director at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. 
"We turned it down after our research showed it had been illegally dug up. 
Even then, the dealer assured us he could arrange the proper documentation." 

   Mr. Morales has made a living in this shady business for decades. 
A short, squat man in his 60s, he began his career as a small-time dry goods merchant 40 years ago, traveling the peasant villages of central Mexico. 
In partial payment for his wares, he often accepted pre-Columbian relics unearthed by the peasants from their plots. 
Later, he would sell them to dealers or collectors in Mexico City. 

   If a piece was particularly valuable, Mr. Morales would locate the field where it was found and supervise the looting of the site. 
Within a few years, his dry-goods trade was no more than a cover-up for his more profitable dealings in antiquities. 

   But there were drawbacks. 
He was jailed twice, and he says he escaped imprisonment other times by paying the police. 
He uses false names at times, and he makes a point of never giving his clients his address or phone number in Mexico City. 
"I check them out, and if we trust each other, I call a few days before visiting," he says. 

   Forgeries are another danger. 
For decades, skilled artisans have reproduced pre-Columbian relics and sold them as genuine. 
Mr. Morales concedes his suppliers occasionally have passed him fraudulent pieces. 
"Some are so good, they can fool me," he says. 
"It's a terrible thing, because even if I sell them to a client in good faith, my reputation can be ruined." 

   The road to Copalillo leads past white ibises and mottled cattle strolling in the shallows of a turquoise lake. 
Asphalt eventually surrenders to gravel, and the path winds down a ravine into Copalillo, a town of mostly thatched-roof huts clinging to cracked gullies. 

   This is a world little changed since the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors more than 400 years ago. 
The peasants speak mostly Nahuatl, the Aztec language. 
There isn't an electric wire or combustion engine in sight. 
The wet season has lifted the corn stalks from the arid soil and blanketed the hills with shrubbery. 

   The Olmec zone is at the southern end of the valley near the confluence of two rivers. 
Because of the daily rains, archaeological work has been temporarily suspended, but the site remains protected by guards. 

   Besides the burial mound, archaeologists have uncovered a canal and dam wall, perhaps the earliest use of irrigation in the New World, and a four-foot-tall stone head of an obese, turbaned man. 
The findings confirm theories that the Olmecs, once thought to have settled only along the Gulf Coast, were well ensconced in the state of Guerrero, closer to the Pacific. 
They may even have originated here. 

   Mr. Morales is disappointed that more figurines have not been dug up. 
"Archaeologists nowadays don't care about idols," he says. 
"They get more excited about garbage piles and latrines." 

   He isn't entirely wrong. 
"Ecological archaeology" has become the vogue. 
Scholars sift through refuse heaps, irrigation canals and house remnants in hopes of reconstructing the diet, demography and social structure of the ancients. 
Their interest in the aesthetics of stone figurines and jewelry has waned. 

   The mackerel sky thickens, and Mr. Morales is anxious to drive back to Mexico City before the rains seal off the valley. 
By the time the car reaches the mountainous exit road, grape-size drops are splattering on the hood. 
The ground melts and the wheels skid as the vehicle inches up the incline. 
Wretched as it is, Copalillo is a welcome sight. 
We stop at a small store, where Mr. Morales used to buy relics. 

   The white-haired shopkeeper recognizes Mr. Morales and greets him in a Nahuatl-Spanish hybrid. 
He invites us home to look at some Olmec artifacts which peasants have unearthed not far from the archaeological site. 
Over a meal of stewed iguana that tastes like game-bird, we inspect the pieces: clay figurines of infants with Oriental faces, a glazed ceramic death-mask, and sinuous reptiles and jaguars carved from jadeite and onyx. 

   Mr. Morales, excited, asks me to step outside a moment. 
He says we could sell the pieces for 10 times what the shopkeeper is asking. 
But I remind him of one of the terms of our agreement. 
Other than my purchase, he'd agreed not to buy or sell any relics on this trip. 
Disgusted, he informs our host that we aren't in the market just now. 

   On the way back to Mexico City, Mr. Morales defends the practice of grave robbing. 
Looters have found many significant archaeological sites in the country, he says. 
Besides, he adds, Mexico will never exhaust its pre-Columbian treasures. 
"The whole nation is one big archaeological site," he says. 

   That isn't far from the truth. 
The National Institute of Anthropology and History, which is preparing an archaeological atlas of the country, estimates there are some 35,000 known pre-Columbian sites that have at least two or three structures other than simple dwellings. 
"The entire Mexican army could not guard that many sites," says Joaquin Garcia Barcena, director of historical monuments for the institute. 

   Even Mexican museum officials concede that looters often act as inadvertent scouts for serious archaeological work. 
The trick is not giving them enough time to devastate a site before scholars arrive. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, scores of Mayan monuments along the Mexico-Guatemala border were destroyed by grave robbers interested only in selling the reliefs and sculptures to dealers in Europe and the U.S. 

   "To see relics like those ripped from their archaeological context is like reading a few pages and burning the rest of the book," says Roberto Garcia Moll, director of Mexico City's National Museum of Anthropology. 

   After dropping Mr. Morales off in Mexico City, I dutifully head for the National Museum of Anthropology to donate the relic I bought from the grave robber. 
The director, Mr. Garcia Moll, carefully inspects my duck, and returns it to me. 

   "Fine piece," he says. 
"You can keep it." 
I'm taken aback. 
"Really good craftsmanship," he adds with a smile. 
"But it's still a forgery."

FT  03 OCT 92 / Travel: Mexico's Chichen Itza - 'Fantastico, no?' / In the
Yucatan, Nicholas Woodsworth tackles Mayan maths and astronomy and takes a
turn around the square in Merida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'Now this,' said Senor Gomez pointing, 'is called El Castillo in Spanish. It
means the castle. But it is not a castle. It is a highly accurate
multi-purpose calendar.'
WE TURNED in the direction he indicated, but saw neither a castle nor a
calendar. Instead, set in the middle of a vast grassy area where guided
tourist groups scurried to and fro, we saw a broad terraced pyramid rising
75ft into the air. Built of grey stone, it was the exact colour of the heavy
storm clouds that hung in the sky behind it.
On each of its four sides a steep flight of steps led up to a flat-topped
temple at its summit. Like ants on an antheap, the stairs and temple-top
were crawling with hundreds of figures dressed in bright red-and-yellow
nylon rain-jackets. Rain threatened.
Our own party was a large, mixed group - mostly German, Italian and Japanese
 -and few of us had an easy command of English. But this did not stop Senor
Gomez from delivering his guided commentary in a succession of rapid, jerky
bursts that left little time for reflection on what it all might mean. This,
after all, was a busy day at Chichen Itza, the most famous of the Yucatan's
Maya Indian ruins, and it looked as if the weather might break at any
minute.
'Now why do I say El Castillo is a multi-purpose calendar?'
A Japanese lady lifted a video camera to her eye and began filming him.
'Well, the Mayas were very interested in measuring time. There are 91 steps
on each of the four faces of the pyramid. That makes 364. Add one more for
the platform at the top and that makes 365, the exact number of days in one
year.' He beamed at us as if this explained it all. But there was more.
'Also, the staircases on each of the pyramid's nine levels show the 18
months of the Maya solar year, and the 52 panels on each side show the
52-year periods of the Maya calendar cycle.' Senor Gomez was getting into
his stride.
'How did the Mayas combine their ritual calendar of 260 days and their solar
calendar of 365 days so the same calculations were possible on both? Easy -
they found a common divisor. Both numbers are divisible by five. By
multiplying five times 52 cycles of 365 days by 73 cycles of 260 days, they
obtained 18,980 days, or 52 years, permitting perfect computations within
the Maya 52-year calendar cycle.'
We stared at him, speechless.
'Fantastico, no?'
Senor Gomez glared around him, as if waiting to be challenged on the clarity
of his explanation. Nobody challenged him. The Japanese lady stopped
filming. 'Say again,' she said.
'No time,' shouted Senor Gomez over his shoulder as he strode off across the
grass, perspiring in the warm and muggy air. 'Now follow me to the Ball
Court. It is a very interesting game. Under Maya rules, the captain of the
team that won was sacrificed to the gods. It was a great honour. Funny, no?
Come. I have many, many things to show you.'
I had had enough and wandered off to climb El Castillo. A puffing 91 steps
later, I was standing on the top and looking out over the endless, dull
green, table-flat jungle of the Yucatan peninsula.
How odd that in the midst of this great expanse of nothing a people more
than 1,000 years ago should have built great cities. How much odder that
they developed a high theocratic culture with advanced mathematics and
astronomy at its pinnacle.
It was scarcely surprising, I thought, that in a tour lasting barely two
hours Senor Gomez found himself hard put to explain the complexities of
Mayan civilisation. Its subtle yet exacting combination of science and
spirituality has baffled trained minds ever since ruined cities began
re-emerging from the Yucatan jungles a century ago. Together, Mayan culture
and Senor Gomez had certainly baffled my mind.
But the complexities of pre-history have not stopped Yucatan from becoming
one of the most popular regions for visitors to Mexico today. Almost
everyone who comes to the peninsula that divides the Caribbean from the Gulf
of Mexico is attracted by the lure of the ancient Mayas. They end up
enjoying it not just for the ruins of the Mayas of the past  - which tend to
be over-crowded, commercialised and difficult to understand - but for a
special atmosphere created by the Mayas of the present.
Rain began to splatter in heavy, warm drops. Straggling crowds streamed
through acres of monuments to seek shelter in refreshment stands and tour
coaches. On the way home to our hotels, a long, dreary drive through low
tropical bushland, the rain continued to fall in heavy sheets. By the time
we reached Merida some two hours later, water had flooded the narrow streets
of the town, stalled cars at intersections, and was lapping over the
sidewalks.
Unable to stir out, I spent the afternoon watching the rain fall onto the
lush vegetation of the inner courtyard garden of the Grande Hotel. A long,
cool drink at hand, I lay back in a rattan-woven planter's chair, the kind
in which colonials in every tropical outpost from Calcutta to Kumasi have
taken their ease. Surrounded by pillastered columns, etched-glass windows,
tropical hardwood furniture and slowly-whirling fans, I felt like a Merida
sisal king.
In the mid-1850s, some 300 years after the Spanish conquistadors had
virtually enslaved the Mayas, Spanish landowners discovered sisal. Used for
making rope and matting, the fibre found a ready market in Europe and the
US. By the late 19th century, the great plantation owners had made Merida a
gracious colonial city boasting more millionaires per capita than any other
in the world.
They sent their children to the best schools in Europe, imported treasures
from all over the world, and led the luxurious life of an aristocracy. To
the baroque cathedrals, governors' palaces and colonial plazas built by
earlier generations of Spaniards in Merida, they added scores of
French-inspired mansions and the Paseo Montejo - a miniature Champs Elysees.
The boom in sisal is long over but Merida's traditions and independent
spirit, like its architecture, food, music and language, remain. For
centuries Yucatecans have lived isolated lives on their southern peninsula.
Cut off from the rest of the country by vast swamps and jungles, they have
always been a group apart, and proud of it.
And what of those Yucatecans who are descended from the builders of the
pyramids? Present-day Mayas - many of them remain pure-blooded - may have
lost political independence and the ability to calculate precise dates 90m
years in advance, but they remain gentle, intelligent, good-humoured people.
To anyone coming from other large Mexican cities where traditional machismo
is so much part of the culture, Merida's 500,000 inhabitants seem an
unusually relaxed and friendly lot.
By the time darkness fell, the rain had stopped, the streets had dried, and
I was able to venture out for that favourite Merida past-time, the evening
paseo. Crowds of strollers had gathered on the Plaza Mayor, and Christmas,
only days away, had brought to the square a special atmosphere.
Trees, lamp-standards and statues were festooned with coloured lights and
paper. At wheeled streetside stalls, dark-haired women in embroidered
blouses were selling snacks of fried plantain, roasted corn and refreshing
glasses of sweet, almond-flavoured horchata. From long poles balanced on
their shoulders, ambulating hawkers sold children's toys: balloons, horns,
masks and flutes. Dressed in their holiday best, enormous families piled
into horse-drawn carriages for an idle tour of the town.
There was no lack of entertainment. Outside the door of the Grande Hotel, a
sidewalk marimba band was floating hot Latin rhythms out into the night. Up
the street in the cathedral, a choir was singing Mozart's Requiem. And on
the square itself, tiny children with dark, bright eyes were re-enacting the
Nativity. In 80'F heat, four-year-old Wise Men in silver paper crowns and
cotton-wool beards led a sad-looking Mexican donkey loaded with gifts to a
manger in a mock-up Bethlehem.
But I contented myself with just a turn or two around the square. I had work
to do. By my bedside table lay a complex tome by the learned Prof Demitrio
Morales. Its title: The Maya World. Tomorrow I would be visiting Uxmal,
another of the Yucatan's great archaeological sites. I was determined this
time, with the professor's help, not to be taken by surprise by a certain
Senor Gomez.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Mexico. Nicholas Woodsworth
flew to Yucatan with American Airlines (London tel: 081-572-5555), which
flies via Miami to the Yucatan resort city of Cancun. Car hire in Mexico is
expensive - about Dollars 80 a day - but many local companies organise tours
of Mayan archaeological sites.
The best time to visit Yucatan is between September and April, when rainfall
is at its lowest. Expect, nonetheless, a warm and humid tropical climate,
and take rainwear.

The Mayan culture remains an enigma. The remnants of roughly a thousand 
communities have been identified, but in most cases not much is known about 
them. Credit that to their locations -- often in the heart of some of the 
world's most forbidding jungles -- and to the fact that Mayan history has not 
been as well documented as that of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
What is left of this vast legacy is disappearing rapidly. Even those remains 
that survive the elements may not survive the looters or the needs of modern 
civilization. Today, Mayan statues might wind up in somebody's villa, while 
building stones are recycled in modern schools or highway roadbeds. 
</P>
<P>
Modern archeology has barely kept pace with the rate of deterioration. Even if 
funding were infinite, there are not enough Mayan scholars to go around, says 
archeologist and Mayan specialist Nicholas Hellmuth of Rollins College in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
And even when a ruin gets the right attention, the process of mapping it often 
falls short. But that is changing now that Hellmuth has introduced the personal 
computer into the heart of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Using computer-aided design (CAD) and highly precise laser mapping techniques 
to chart the ruin site, the researcher has produced animated displays of the 
ruins as they are -- and once were, at the height of their splendor 17 
centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional methods involve a lot of elbow grease and subjectivity. First, a 
compass was used to determine a structure's orientation; measuring ropes or 
tapes established its dimensions, and an artist's sketch provided the visual 
rendering. Later, surveying techniques commonly associated with building or 
highway construction added a degree of geometric accuracy, but they still fell 
short. "These methods make a lot of assumptions, such as that the lines are 
always straight and that everything is always squared off," said St. Louis 
architect Daniel Hellmuth, Nicholas Hellmuth's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Photogrammetry, a process using stereoscopic cameras, enabled archeologists to 
visually reconstruct a site stone by stone (such a process is being used to 
help reconstruct the Great Sphinx). 
</P>
<P>
But photogrammetry is costly and time-consuming, requiring that the pictures be 
assembled back at the lab to derive the building's geometric coordinates. By 
the time a site is mapped, a hurricane could have washed most of the remains 
away. 
</P>
<P>
To gain a critical edge in the race against time, Nicholas Hellmuth tried yet 
another tack: Backpack a personal computer into the heart of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
But computers can be delicate. Traditionally, large mainframe systems serving 
businesses were housed in cooled control rooms. When the PC came along, it 
became possible to operate units at room temperature -- as long as there was a 
room in which to situate one. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of rooms at the Mayan site -- a 44-room palace at Santa Rosa 
Xtampak, an ancient regional capital in the heart of the Yucatan. But the 
temperature inside was hardly what is thought of as room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"We had climate control from Mother Nature," said Hellmuth, noting that 
temperature and humidity percentage both typically ranged in the high 90s 
during the course of the project, which, as luck had it, was done during the 
height of the rainy season. "People swore the computer wouldn't work, that 
fungus would grow on the floppy disks, and that the power surges (from the 
portable generator) would blow the computer." 
</P>
<P>
But the computer lived to tell the story -- one with a few unlikely plot 
twists. "None of the walls were perpendicular. Not one of them went up in a 
straight line for more than a few inches," said team member Daniel Hellmuth, 
who plotted the data on some of the palace's rooms, vaults and stairwells on 
the PC using AutoCAD, a popular CAD program. "The Mayans weren't sloppy," said 
Nicholas Hellmuth. "They were interested in monumental ideas, and the fact that 
the walls weren't straight wasn't very important to them. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were incredible engineers," he added, noting that many of the 
palaces they constructed dwarf anything built in southern Mexico or Guatemala 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary surveying may not have caught all these irregularities, while 
photogrammetry -- which was also used at Xtampak to validate the CAD data -- 
would not have revealed them until several months later. Furthermore, it is 
difficult to take a stereoscopic photo inside a closed space and get it 
properly correlated. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a team from the Technical University of Graz, Austria, is analyzing 
the photogrammetric data of the palace exterior, while Hellmuth's team is 
assembling CAD data to produce three-dimensional, shaded visualizations of the 
winding internal staircases. The ultimate goal of the project, says Hellmuth, 
is to train local archeologists to use inexpensive tools like CAD to document 
their heritage before it disappears. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of a CAD system on site also provided more immediate advantages. 
CAD's precision, said Daniel Hellmuth, quickly revealed gaps in the data. 
Furthermore, added Nicholas, the computer running the CAD program could also be 
used to write the field report while the work was still under way, making it 
more accurate and complete. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that CAD has been used in archeology, but typically 
it had been run back in the lab to tabulate field data. "I wouldn't be 
surprised if CAD will be used in the field a lot more in the future," said 
University of Chicago Egyptologist Mark Lehner. "But I don't know of anyone 
taking it out there now." 
</P>
<P>
Besides filing more accurate and complete reports, perhaps the most significant 
advantage of using CAD may be in visualization. Animated displays can depict 
eerily accurate walk-through views of the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
The animations are not just bells and whistles, insists Hellmuth. They could be 
used to let people walk through the ruins on a computer screen in a museum, 
rather than trampling all over the site. They could also become critical in the 
increasingly competitive quest to solicit financial support from foundations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, such visualizations may soon become necessary now that the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is frowning on site 
restorations that, in the past, proved merely cosmetic. Under the new 
international guidelines, archeologists will be allowed only to shore up 
existing ruins, not rebuild them. 
</P>
<P>
CAD may help in those consolidations, said Atlanta-based consulting engineer 
James O'Kon, adviser on the project. CAD data could be fed into structural 
analysis programs that can help project workers decide how to reinforce 
existing ruins. 
</P>
<P>
With all its advantages, noted the University of Chicago's Lehner, CAD still 
lacks the fine detail of photogrammetry. (Lehner is using photogrammetry as 
part of the Sphinx restoration project.) "If you want a detailed map on how the 
stones are placed, you will need photogrammetry," he said. Such detail, 
responded Hellmuth, is overkill when mapping individual sites cluttered with 
vegetation, such as Xtampak, or ancient cities involving large numbers of 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But in the future, it might not be an either-or question. Hellmuth predicts 
that CAD and photogrammetric technologies could merge within five years, thanks 
to more powerful personal computers. With such a system, technicians would take 
digitized stereoscopic pictures, rather than photographs, on the spot, readily 
feeding them to a computer. 
</P>
<P>
The Xtampak expedition, conducted in mid-1989, was a joint undertaking of the 
Foundation for Latin American Anthropological Research, a publicly funded 
nonprofit organization founded by Hellmuth, and the Universidad Autonoma de 
Campeche in the southern Yucatan peninsula, where the ruins are located, under 
the leadership of Prof. William Folan of Campeche.

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: NATURE GETS TOP BILLING IN YUCATAN'S SIAN KA'AN

YUCATAN PENINSULA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were floating on our backs in a swift current toward the sea, treading water 
lazily as the canal carried us through a bulrush marsh that stretched as far as 
the eye could see. 
</P>
<P>
The turquoise shoals of the Caribbean lay six miles east, while an equal 
distance behind us the marsh turned first to mangroves and then to the dense, 
steaming rain forest where our journey had begun. 
</P>
<P>
In between, the crystalline waters of this remarkable system of lagoons and 
canals, carved into the limestone shelf that forms the entire Yucatan 
Peninsula, carried us along its ancient wetland course -- exactly as it carried 
the Mayan traders who dug the canals a millennium or more ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding a bend, my fantasies of a time warp were shattered by a call from the 
boatmen 30 feet behind us. He was frantically pointing to a spot along the 
canal just ahead of me, flapping his arms and speaking in a rush of Spanish too 
fast for any of us to understand. "Jabiru, jabiru, jabiru!" he seemed to say. 
</P>
<P>
Jabiru? No comprendo. 
</P>
<P>
An ear-shattering screech from an overhanging tree not five feet above my head 
provided the answer. Scrambling to stand against the current, we looked up to 
see two huge, gaping, screaming beaks attached to balls of downy brown 
feathers, both leaning out from their nest in a hissing, screaming, spitting 
display of indignation. 
</P>
<P>
Vaulting into the boat for a camera, we managed to snap off a few shots before 
the current carried us away. The birds, the boatman explained, were very rare 
baby jabiru -- storks -- and the mother has a wingspan of eight to 10 feet 
(hence the flapping of arms). 
</P>
<P>
Hearing this, we decided that the better part of valor was to put some distance 
between us and the little ones before mom decided to pay us a visit. 
</P>
<P>
They call it Sian Ka'an -- which is variously translated from the Mayan as 
"Gateway to Heaven" or "Birth of the Sky." What it is is a miracle by any 
definition -- a 1.3-million-acre "biosphere" that contains a richness of 
archeological, cultural and ecological treasures that would have made the 
conquistadors' unfound pot of gold appear silvery pale in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 Mayan archeological sites have been officially identified here, 
including numerous pyramids, temples, canals, highways and entire cities. 
Experts believe some of the best finds might yet remain hidden under the forest 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Some 350 species of birds -- including the endangered stork, a variety of rare 
parrots, keel-billed toucans, ibises, flamingoes, pelicans and great blue 
herons -- call Sian Ka'an home at various times of the year, as do four of the 
world's eight species of endangered sea turtle. 
</P>
<P>
Sea manatees and spiny lobster thrive along Sian Ka'an's two big coastal bays 
and inside its coral reef, the longest in the Western Hemisphere. And the 
forest and mangrove swamps shelter a menagerie of rare and wondrous wildlife -- 
jaguars, howler monkeys, miniature deer, tapirs, ocelots and crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, of course, the 16th-Century conquistadors did find Sian Ka'an 
and its once magnificent cities. But they lacked the vision to see the real 
treasures here, and they settled for merely conquering, converting and 
infecting the peoples they found before repairing to their fortresses to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 400 years or so, Sian Ka'an and the other centers of Mayan culture 
to the west and the south were left much to their own devices, carrying on 
their ancient, if Christian-influenced, traditions, speaking their own 
language, eking out a miserable but independent existence through subsistence 
agriculture and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the early years of this century that the Mexican government 
even attempted to exert its influence in this part of the Yucatan. 
</P>
<P>
Today, only about a thousand Mayans remain in Sian Ka'an, scattered in tiny, 
inaccessible villages in the dense jungle of the interior and a few coastal 
centers, where they have formed farming and fishing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to their own wisdom and the dedicated efforts of environmentalists 
who have won limited protections for Sian Ka'an and other Mayan centers, it now 
appears that these mysterious people and their beautiful, rich land may 
survive, and even accommodate, the latest and most threatening incarnation of 
the conquistadors: the 20th-Century variety known as tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The threat is real, and it grows closer every day. It comes from the inexorable 
pressure for raw materials, cheap labor and untouched expanses of glittering 
Caribbean beachfront emanating from neighboring Cancun, just 80 miles north of 
the northern boundary of Sian Ka'an. 
</P>
<P>
The contrasts between the two regions couldn't be greater -- modern versus 
ancient, congestion versus solitude, glass and concrete versus marsh and 
forest, wealth versus poverty. But for all its glitzy artificiality, Cancun is 
no less "alive" than Sian Ka'an, and it is expanding at the rate of 25% to 30% 
a year, consuming thousands of acres of forest and mile after mile of some of 
the most magnificent sandy beach in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Cancun (appropriately, "nest of serpents" in Mayan) was a 
tiny seaside resort, a mere glint in the eyes of government tourism officials. 
Today it is Mexico's fastest growing city, an instant metropolis of more than 
300,000 permanent residents, most of whom live off the more than 20,000 luxury 
hotel rooms that line its white, talcum-like beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the so-called "Cancun-to-Tulum corridor," the 80-mile strip of 
developed coast that reaches to the northern edge of Sian Ka'an at the ancient 
Mayan seaport of Tulum, provides more tourist accommodations than any place in 
the entire Caribbean, including all of Puerto Rico, according to the proud 
boast of a government tourist official. 
</P>
<P>
It attracts an estimated 2 million visitors a year from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
According to worst-case estimates (or best-case, depending on one's 
perspective), as many as 65,000 more hotel rooms will be constructed along the 
corridor during the next three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Given the tragedies of Mayan history, the people of Sian Ka'an and those who 
would protect it are given to taking worst-case estimates seriously. Which is 
why Mayan farmers and fishermen who have never heard of national parks and who 
have practiced ruinous "slash and burn" agriculture for centuries have suddenly 
become ardent conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"For them," said Adela Samper, a representative of a private, nongovernmental 
organization called the Amigos de Sian Ka'an, "conservation isn't an abstract 
or elite idea at all. It's a matter of the life and death of their own 
communities and their way of life." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after years of local and outside environmentalist pressure, the 
government of Mexico declared the entire Sian Ka'an region a Biosphere Reserve, 
thus extending limited but important safeguards against inappropriate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, the United Nations included Sian Ka'an in its international 
network of Biosphere Reserves, mandating that "nucleus" regions be set aside 
for unadulterated conservation and limited scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
Around those zones, a broader "buffer zone" has been defined in which 
indigenous populations may continue to live and exploit natural and touristic 
resources, but only in a highly regulated manner that emphasizes sustainable 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The concept, explained Samper, is relatively new to the conservation movement. 
It differs from national parks in that it recognizes that pure conservation is 
often an inappropriate, if not impossible, option in poverty-stricken Third 
World regions where local tribes have a stake in the land that reaches back 
centuries -- or, in the case of Sian Ka'an, millennia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to come in here and tell the people they can't live over there 
anymore, or hunt in that swamp or fish in that bay, they'd just ignore us -- as 
they should," Samper said. "So the idea of a biosphere is to work very closely 
with the local people, to gain their trust and help them find ways to survive 
and even improve their lot without doing further damage to the land." 
</P>
<P>
At Sian Ka'an, this approach has led to the establishment of a demonstration 
farm that teaches intensive methods of cultivation and crop rotation as an 
alternative to slash-and-burn, and the creation of marketing co-ops in the 
fishing communities, along with strict monitoring and regulation of the lobster 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an even larger Mayan region, known as Calakmul, was declared a 
biosphere in the southern Yucatan on the Guatemalan border. It adjoins 
Guatemala's first biosphere, and the two may soon be joined by a small 
biosphere candidate in northern Belize. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they would comprise a much-hoped-for, three-nation "Mayan Peace Park" 
totaling some five million acres . . . twice the size of Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of this union of the Mayan biospheres -- a plan known as La Ruta Maya 
-- hope that parts of El Salvador and Honduras will also join in the 
preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
They envision a futuristic system of "eco-tourism" for the entire Mayan region 
that would allow thousands of visitors to pass through the fragile forests and 
major archeological sites via a carefully regulated network of guided bus tours 
and monorails that would leave the environment relatively unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, unguided tourist incursions into the Mayan reserves remain 
difficult and hazardous at best, given the lack of paved roads or 
accommodations. Even backpacking is out of the question for most of Sian Ka'an, 
where the rain forest is virtually impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean, of course, that the determined bird watcher, amateur 
archeologist, anthropologist, or just plain rabid, must-see-everything tourist 
can't enjoy Sian Ka'an. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the biosphere concept is to promote limited tourism for the benefit of 
the reserve itself," said Sampan, noting that the Friends of Sian Ka'an, with 
financial support from the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, even 
has a director of "ecotourism." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the organization started conducting one-day tours for up 
to six people at a time through one of the more accessible and archeologically 
significant portions of the reserve -- a tour I will always remember as the Day 
of the Screaming Storks. 
</P>
<P>
Setting out from Cancun, our group drove for 1 1/2 hours south to Tulum, past 
the expanse of oceanfront luxury resorts. A few miles south of Tulum, at the 
little resort of Chac Mool, we left the paved road and entered the reserve on 
our way to Chunyaxche (Muyil in Spanish), an inland seaport first settled 
around the year AD 1, according to the Tulane University archeologists working 
there with local Mayan helpers. 
</P>
<P>
Even before reaching the main ruins, we could glimpse through openings in the 
forest the rough outlines of ancient stone structures that have not yet been 
cleared of centuries of overgrowth. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the dirt road, we left our van and, after dousing ourselves with 
insect repellent to ward off the mosquitoes, we set off for a short hike down a 
narrow path slashed through the dense forest. 
</P>
<P>
Recent excavations have revealed centuries-old structures of varying sizes 
spaced about every 25 yards along the pathway. 
</P>
<P>
No guards were anywhere to be seen, no rangers, no T-shirt concessionaires, no 
officials or even signs of any sort to tell us not to scamper to the top of the 
crumbling pyramid temples and poke our heads into dark recesses, frightening 
Gila monsters and ourselves. We had only our guide from Amigos and our own 
sense of what was appropriate to limit our explorations. 
</P>
<P>
From Chunyaxche we drove down a narrow rutted road to Muyil Lagoon, a 
freshwater lake that begins the old water route to the sea, some 15 miles east. 
There, at the end of a rickety dock, four Mayan children splashed in the water 
and played in a dugout canoe -- a miniature replica of those their ancestors 
used centuries ago -- while their fathers, our boatmen, patiently waited our 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
A quick trip across the lagoon brought us to the entrance to the first of a 
series of Mayan-built canals -- about four feet wide, just enough for the boat 
to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
These artificial canals, not discovered by Europeans until the 1920s, spill 
finally into Laguna Chunyaxche, a large lake surrounded by marsh and mangrove. 
Crossing it, we entered yet another series of canals, known as Xlahpak, these 
being natural instead of man-made and eight to ten feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
As we coursed closer to the sea, the current grew stronger, allowing us to shut 
down the outboard and drift, enjoying the silence, interrupted only by the 
occasional cry of herons or excited exclamations over the sighting of a king 
vulture or other exotic bird. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, looming up out of nowhere in the reeds ahead, a 1,000-year-old 
building appeared just 15 feet from the canal. Built of massive carved stones, 
its intricate decorative detail was easily visible from the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The boatman explained that it was nothing more significant than an ordinary 
guardhouse along a route that once carried thousands of traders from the rich 
Mayan seaports of Guatemala and Belize to the interior settlements at Muyil and 
on to Copa, a major Mayan city far inland. 
</P>
<P>
Growing hot, a few of us plunged into the canal, drifting for perhaps a mile 
downstream until the noisy complaints of the jabiru sent us scampering back 
into the boat for the remainder of the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the last canal empties into Laguna Boca Paia, actually a long narrow 
bay that opens through a 500-foot-wide barrier reef into the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the boat at the lagoon side of the reef, we wandered up a well-worn 
trail to the opposite, ocean-side shore, discovering ourselves smack in the 
middle of a little fishing resort, served by a dirt road that runs the length 
of the reef. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen small, thatched cabanas were tucked under waving palms 100 feet 
from the surf, and as many outboard fishing boats were moored at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
The road that runs down the 25-mile reef passes maybe a half-dozen such 
resorts, as well as a dozen or more private, beachfront homes, before it ends 
in Punta Allen, a small Mayan fishing port within the reserve that produces 
about 65 tons of U.S.-bound lobster tails each year. 
</P>
<P>
The properties are private and predate the establishment of the reserve, so 
they're permitted to continue to operate under casual supervision. 
</P>
<P>
By evening, we were back amid the comforts of Cancun, and entire world removed 
from the "Gateway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Amigos de Sian Ka'an charges $85 per person for the one-day tour in the 
reserve. Arrangements can be made through most major hotels in Cancun or, 
better, by writing to Amigos de Sian Ka'an, Apartado Postal 770, Cancun 77500, 
Quintana Roo, Mexico.

<TEXT>
<P>
As Hernan Cortes' small army neared the Aztecan capital of Tenochtitlan in 
1519, they arrived at Iztapalapa, a hilltop village that gave the Spaniards 
their first panoramic view of the sprawling New World metropolis in the valley 
of Mexico. Cortes and his men numbered only 400. The city was the seat of the 
expansive Aztec empire, and had a population of a half million. 
</P>
<P>
As one chronicler in Cortes' band described it, "We saw so many cities and 
villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land . . . we were 
amazed and said that it was like the enchantments they tell of in the legend of 
Amadis, on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the 
water . . . And some of our soldiers asked whether the things that we saw were 
not a dream . . . all was cemented and very splendid with many kinds of stone 
monuments with pictures on them, which gave much to think about." 
</P>
<P>
It is in such moments of confounded awe -- on the eve of great destruction -- 
that Mexican art, as we know it, had its ambiguous birth. For finally, the 
conquest of Mexico was as much a triumph of the eye as it was a victory of the 
sword and gun. 
</P>
<P>
For many years to come, the conquistadores' way of seeing the world would be 
the only true one, and they quickly set about remaking much of the fantastic, 
alien world they encountered in their own image, as a "New Spain." 
</P>
<P>
The chronicler, writing 30 years after the events, concludes his account of the 
dazzling first sight of Tenochtitlan by noting that, "Of all these wonders that 
I then beheld today all is overthrown and lost, nothing left standing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 471 years later, at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
preparations are nearly complete for a new Mexican conquest. Opening Oct. 10 is 
"Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries," the most significant exhibition of art 
from Mexico to appear in New York in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
From New York City, the nearly 400 objects in the show will later travel 
exclusively to the two Chicano capitals of Mexamerica, appearing first at the 
San Antonio Museum of Art (April 6-Aug. 4, 1991), and then at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art (Sept. 29-Dec. 29, 1991). For Los Angeles, it will be the 
most important public presentation of Mexican art since the 1978 "Treasures of 
Mexico" show, sponsored by the Armand Hammer Foundation at the County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted "Twenty Centuries of 
Mexican Art," the first major exhibition of its kind to be shown in the United 
States (see accompanying story). And in 1970, the Metropolitan Museum hosted 
"Before Cortes," an historic show of the pre-Columbian sculpture of 
Mesoamerica. 
</P>
<P>
But the Met show is perhaps the most comprehensive collection of ancient, 
colonial and modern Mexican artistry ever assembled in the United States. In 
scale, it is the largest show the museum has presented since "The Vatican 
Collection: The Papacy and Art" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, designers, lighting engineers, and workmen at the Metropolitan 
Museum are finishing the specially constructed, maze-like exhibition gallery as 
some of the pieces are being installed. 
</P>
<P>
According to the show's four co-curators, all members of the museum staff, 
featured works include Mayan and Aztecan sculptures, early post-conquest 
manuscripts, popular religious and devotional objects, costumes, graphics, and 
paintings, ranging in date of origin from 1000 BC to AD 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Amassing such an enormous grouping of objects is a logistics triumph that has 
been three years in the making, with pieces drawn from 41 public and 24 private 
collections in Mexico, the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The principal financial supporter of the multi-million dollar event is a newly 
formed, Los Angeles-based foundation, "Friends of the Arts of Mexico," which in 
turn is the brainchild of Emilio Azcarraga, the chairman of Mexico's Televisa 
network. In 1987, Azcarraga approached Philippe de Montebello, director of the 
Metropolitan Museum, with the idea for a comprehensive show of Mexican art. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" is its most high-profile 
undertaking to date, the organization -- which has a mandate to promote 
appreciation of Mexico's artistic and cultural heritage in this country -- has 
already sponsored a touring exhibition of work by young Mexican artists, as 
well as efforts to preserve the Rock Art of Baja California and the David 
Alfaro Siquieros "America Tropical" mural on Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
John McDonald, exhibition coordinator of the Metropolitan show, and curator for 
the 19th-Century section, modestly sums up the collection that has been 
gathered for the October opening in New York City as "more than a roundup of 
the usual suspects." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do a comprehensive exhibition. With 50 years since the last major 
show, it was long enough for people to forget, for generations to come and go 
and not have a chance to see this work. It will be an eye-opener for a New York 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
As befits an imperial exhibition of this sort, the scope of cultural periods 
and styles to be represented in the show is impressive, offering the North 
American public a rare opportunity to see under one roof a spectrum of Mexican 
artistic expression that would be difficult to match in weeks of museum touring 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the pre-Hispanic section, which will comprise one-third of the 
exhibition, will be one of the colossal stone heads of the Olmec people, who 
came before the more familiar Mayan and Aztecan civilizations. The giant heads, 
discovered in La Venta and San Lorenzo, Tabasco on the Gulf Coast beginning in 
the 1920s, depict faces that appear distinctly Negroid and have caused many to 
speculate on the possibility of ancient contact between the peoples of 
Mesoamerica and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
From the ancient Mayan city of Palenque, there will be an exquisitely 
naturalistic sculptured stucco head with an unforgettable penetrating, yet 
tranquil gaze. Julie Jones, curator for this section of the exhibition, 
explains that recent breakthroughs in cracking the Mayan hieroglyphic language 
allow us to now identify this figure as the king Pacal II, who ruled Palenque 
during during its 7th-Century heyday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jones, the pre-Columbian portion of the show will not just be "the 
son of 'Before Cortes,' " -- the Metropolitan's 1970 show -- but will reflect 
the expansion of knowledge related to the ancient cultures of Mexico that has 
taken place over the last 50 years, with such "meaningful digging" as the 1978 
excavation of the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The cultures of civilizations before the conquest will be further explored 
through artifacts of the great cities of Izapa, Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, 
Palenque, El Tajin, Chichen Itza and Tenochtitlan. 
</P>
<P>
With the mixing of Spanish and indigenous blood after the conquest, Mexican art 
begins to reflect the mastery and subtle transformation of European artistic 
styles, along with an abiding rootedness in the ritual power and visual drama 
of the Pre-Hispanic cultures. A good deal of the rest of the show will 
illustrate this extraordinary tension which is the veritable reactor core of 
the Mexican tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than finding continuity," observes Johanna Hecht, curator for the 
Colonial -- or Viceregal -- element of the collection, "I would say there is a 
kind of attitude or historical sensibility that carries through. Aztecs 
attempted to identify with the Toltecs. And the criollos and mestizos come to 
do the same with the Aztecs." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to advance criticism of her section by some art critics, Hecht 
insists she is not presenting "conquistador art." Indeed, there will be an 
anonymous miniature folk sculpture of St. James the Moor Killer, ironically 
depicted as a conquistador. Also, Jose de Alcibar's somber 1777 religious 
portrait of the newly ordained 22-year-old nun Sor Maria Ignacia de la Sangre, 
which out-Baroques the Spanish master Velazquez with a dizzying excess of 
floral ornamentation and fetishized Christian iconography that comes close to 
being neo-Aztecan kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
A stunning 16th-Century mosaic image of the Virgen de Guadalupe in the show 
stands six feet high and is executed entirely in mother-of-pearl inlay on wood, 
in a frame adorned with cracked shells. This artisanal object exudes a primal 
aura that resonates with the presence of the Madonna's Indian alter-image, 
Tonantzin, the Aztecan goddess who had been worshipped, before the Spanish 
</P>
<P>
came, on the hill where Juan Diego had his visions of the Virgen. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, because of lending restrictions, this mosaic is among several objects 
that will only appear in the Metropolitan Museum's installation of the show, 
depriving Los Angeles and San Antonio of potentially one of the most popular 
objects in the assembled collection. (This omission may yet lead to the first 
time someone comes to the Metropolitan Museum on a sacred pilgrimage -- a 
number of years ago, a replica from Mexico of the Virgen de San Juan de los 
Lagos attracted thousands of San Antonio worshipers to a barrio chapel to view 
and pray to the small figure.) 
</P>
<P>
With the works to be shown in the 19th- and 20th-Century sections of the 
exhibition, another current of the complex Mexican psyche will be evident. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellion and the struggle for independence are now almost genetically 
ingrained in the Mexican national consciousness. For many artists, this has 
provoked passionate efforts to transcend the Eurocentric vision of the 
conquistador that marked modern Mexico's beginning and achieve a completely 
native aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan show promises an array of explosive self-portraits that 
testify to this inner struggle among Mexican artists. From the smoldering stare 
of Hermenegildo Bustos painted in 1891, to the exotic personal mythology of 
Frida Kahlo's "Self Portrait With Monkeys," and the fiery iconoclasm of 
muralist David Alfaro Siquieros' self-portrait, where, with outstretched arm in 
front of him, the artist appears to be tearing at the canvas, attempting to 
escape, or perhaps, to pull the viewer in. All of these paintings, and other 
work by masters such as Jose Maria Velasco, Jose Guadalupe Posada, Diego Rivera 
and the major muralists, and Rufino Tamayo, testify to the crucible of 
self-exploration that has been the forge of revolutionary change in Mexico for 
the last two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the museum and foundation literature describing the monumental show 
emphasizes the theme of the Mexican tradition's grandeur and continuity, 
offering the images and objects of the massive exhibition as a collective 
symbol of modern Mexico's rich cultural patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has one of the most ancient, continuous, and important artistic 
heritages of any region of the Americas," observes museum director Philippe de 
Montebello in one exhibition press release. "As our neighbor and friend it 
should be better known to us." 
</P>
<P>
The show itself will essentially be organized around the history, and 
prehistory, of the modern Mexican state. With one-third of the exhibits devoted 
to the pre-Columbian civilizations, and another third devoted to the colonial 
period, the remaining work will represent the Independence and Revolutionary 
periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively. The latest work dates 
from 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, from Mayan stelae to Diego Rivera, the assemblage approximates a 
family history of what Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- in 
another piece of exhibition literature -- calls "La identidad nacional" (The 
national identity). The President's office, along with the Ministry of Tourism, 
has gotten into the act with a festival of events, "Mexico: A Work of Art," 
adding yet another level of public relations patina to the Metropolitan show. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the new exhibition's rather safe conceptual scheme mimics the 
general outline of the 1940 MOMA show, as well as the 1978 exhibition at LACMA. 
Consequently, important recent experiences in Mexico's history, from the demise 
of the idealism of the muralists, to the 1968 student massacre at Tlateloco, 
crippling international debt, and the devastating Mexico City earthquake, will 
go unnoted. And we will have to wait for the next major Mexico show to hope for 
a more thematically reflective and syncretic approach to the profound questions 
Mexico's traditions present. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the omission of contemporary work, exhibition coordinator McDonald 
explains, "If we had tried to do it justice, we would've had to nibble back on 
other sections -- or break up the show with a staircase to another floor." (The 
exhibit also contains no folk art, which was included in the 1940 MOMA show.) 
</P>
<P>
While this artistic Circus Maximus of things Mexican is likely to win a new 
host of aficionados in New York City, it will be interesting to follow the 
Metropolitan show's impact in San Antonio and Los Angeles, where the rich array 
of objects and images may yet rekindle some of the nationalist artistic 
sentiment that marked so much Chicano art of the Movimiento period through the 
'60s and '70s. At a time when young Mexican Americans are exploring new 
expressions of their own "root aesthetic" in rap, performance art, and film, 
such exposure could add heat and light to their mounting critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shortcomings or exaggerations may exist in the show's interstices, the 
exhibits, along with a season of related lectures and films, will compose a 
not-to-be-missed tableau of the ages of a nation. Of course, there would seem 
to be limits to what can be shipped and seen in this country. "You can't 
transport Teotihuacan or Monte Alban or a baroque church," muses McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" we are likely to glimpse the 
deeper streams of Mexican identity, too often overlooked in media coverage of 
the country's Byzantine political system, its poverty- and debt-burdened 
economy, and the perennial concern with the flow of undocumented workers across 
the U.S. border.

THE JUNGLE IS SO THICK THAT ARTHUR Demarest and the archeological inspector 
assigned to him don't see the army platoon until the comandante is in their 
path, demanding identification. Demarest has plenty: documents from Guatemala's 
History and Anthropology Institute, a gold-sealed letter from National 
Geographic and even a notarized Spanish translation of his Harvard diploma. The 
comandante, whose squadron of full-blooded Mayan Indians appears ominously 
battle-scarred, offers to lead them to the cave they're seeking -- not exactly 
the safest proposition in this guerrilla-infested rain forest, but unavoidable 
under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours they follow their machete-wielding guides through the 
amber-green filtered light of the mahogany canopy, their eyes probing the leafy 
ground cover for venomous serpents while scarlet macaws screech overhead. 
Finally they arrive at a large hole in the moist soil, leading into a limestone 
cave. As they descend, their lamps reveal a stretch of stalactites, an altar 
black with burned incense, human bones painted red, ceramic pottery, lithic 
spear points and a cascading stream. There is a noise, and something shoots 
past them; a large tropical rodent called a tepezquintle, a local delicacy. 
Immediately, soldiers aim their automatic M-16s, and everyone screams. The 
inspector drops his camera, breaking it, and Demarest pleads with the 
comandante to stop the firing; pots will be trampled, ricocheting bullets will 
kill them all, the cave will collapse -- and with it his hopes of answering the 
question he is spending more than $1 million to answer. Eventually, the rodent 
disappears, the soldiers hold their fire, and the archeologist, the inspector 
and the artifacts escape unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
IT IS ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT MYSTERIES. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for certain where they came from. As for when they arrived in 
Central America, less is presumed now than 20 years ago, because the dating of 
early relics at 2500 BC hinged on faulty carbon-14 data. Assumptions abruptly 
dissolved, leaving the truth buried beneath more than two millennia's worth of 
jungle and alluvium. It is generally agreed, however, that by 900 BC a 
sophisticated culture called Maya had spread across the great lowland limestone 
shelf that today comprises Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, Belize and the northern 
half of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
It was an elaborate society that must have seemed to its people destined to 
thrive forever. Sixteen-hundred years later, at least 6 million Maya lived in 
what in some ways resembled Southern California: a flourishing megalopolis of 
city-states, with few breaks among their overlapping suburbs. Their monumental 
architecture, as well as their painting, astronomy, mathematics and literature, 
humbled the achievements of their contemporaries in Europe. Equally striking 
and far less understood is how so many could inhabit a tropical rain forest. 
For centuries, they raised their food and families in the same fragile 
environment that today is quickly devastated by a relatively few hungry 
squatters. 
</P>
<P>
What has baffled archeologists even more, however, is the Maya's spectacular, 
sudden collapse. Within just 100 years at the beginning of the 8th Century, 
lowland Mayan civilization simply vanished. In most of the Yucatan, only 
scattered remnants of the population remained; the Peten province that 
encompasses northern Guatemala was left virtually uninhabited. Rain-forest 
vegetation soon overran the ball courts and plazas, enshrouding tall pyramids. 
Except for an occasional vagrant Spanish conquistador, not until the 19th 
Century would the world again be aware of the Maya's existence. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation over what happened to the Maya has included possibilities such as 
famine, epidemics, overpopulation and soil erosion -- yet for each explanation, 
arguments exist against its causing extinction on such a massive scale. 
Although most Mayan cities were notably indefensible, no relics indicate a 
significant invasion of alien forces. Often extolled as history's exemplary 
peaceful society, the Maya seemed least likely to consume themselves in 
internal warfare. Yet Demarest's recent discoveries in the steamy Peten suggest 
that is exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Under the co-sponsorship of Vanderbilt University and the Instituto de 
Antropologia y Historia de Guatemala, one of the most ambitious archeological 
ventures ever assembled has begun a quest for the answer to the Mayan collapse. 
Demarest, its brash 37-year-old director, is a Louisiana Cajun who won an 
international reputation while still a graduate student. Five years ago, he 
declined a Harvard chair considered to be the most distinguished position in 
archeology because Vanderbilt offered him a chance to set up his own 
Mesoamerican department and select a dream project. After barely a year, 
accounts from Guatemala's Peten jungles of his team's findings have evoked 
comparisons to Indiana Jones -- analogies that even he occasionally lets slip 
when confronting yet another pristine cavern laden with ancient Mayan ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there the resemblance ends. Instead of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the movie 
that most often comes to Demarest's mind is "The Year of Living Dangerously." 
In Guatemala, guerrillas and the army stalk each other within a few kilometers 
of his excavations, catching in their cross-fire people who still speak 
languages derived from those used for the hieroglyphics his team is decoding. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones," he says wearily, "swashbuckled through a mythical, generic, 
non-English-speaking Third World of swarthy people with threatening, 
incomprehensible ways, defeating them with American heroics and seizing their 
treasures. But archeology isn't about glittery objects -- it's about their 
context. We're part of the context. It's our workers whose fields are burning; 
it's their children with malaria. We come to study ancient civilization, but we 
end up learning about now." 
</P>
<P>
It is late; the generator in his field camp is off, and he works at his desk 
through the humid night by Coleman lantern, his fingers worrying his thick 
black hair. In the distance, bursts of artillery pierce the steady rumbling of 
howler monkeys. "Indiana Jones would have lasted maybe five seconds here," he 
says. "About the least successful approach to Latin America is pulling a John 
Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Demarest has come to the Peten to prove his theory that, over 2,000 years, the 
Maya evolved a means of resolving conflicts among nations without destroying 
each others' societies -- but then something went wrong. With an international 
team that includes earth scientists and an assortment of archeological 
specialists, he intends to spend the next five years finding out exactly what. 
</P>
<P>
Besides receiving grants from the National Geographic Society, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities and Alimentos Kerns, a Guatemalan corporation, his 
project has also attracted funding from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Peace 
Foundation and the United States Institute for Peace. In an endless stream of 
grant proposals, Demarest has pointed out that grasping what happened to the 
Maya may reveal why all civilizations seem to rise only to bring themselves 
down -- and perhaps offer clues about how, for once, that might be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
FORTY MINUTES NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND city of Flores on Guatemala's Lake Peten 
Itxa, a paved road arrives at the fabulous ruins of Tikal, the largest classic 
Mayan site, its white temples soaring 230 feet above the jungle floor. In the 
opposite direction, another road from Flores, decidedly unpaved, leads 
southwest for three miserable hours. Passing through various army checkpoints 
and an occasional guerrilla roadblock, it ends at the scruffy outpost of 
Sayaxche, where a machine-gun emplacement perches atop a Mayan pyramid and 
where no one is up to any particular good. 
</P>
<P>
Sayaxche is on the Rio Pasion -- the Passion River -- which slithers through 
the western Peten to the confluence of the rivers Usamacinta and Salinas, 
together forming Guatemala's border with Mexico. Once the Pasion was a chief 
route for trade in jade, fine pottery, quetzal feathers and jaguar skins. 
Today's traffic includes contraband mahogany and cedar logs, opium from 
Guatemalan highland poppies and looted Mayan artifacts. Down one of its 
sluggish tributaries, motor-driven wooden launches also have recently carried 
quantities of two modest items that in the Peten are veritable luxuries: 
corrugated tin roofing and cases of Spam. 
</P>
<P>
The roofing was for the base camp that Demarest built in a jungle clearing for 
the 23 archeologists and more than 100 workmen he had hired by the end of the 
digging season, which lasts from January to June. The Spam was the most 
recognizable component of their daily sustenance. In just five years, the 
Mesoamerican program Demarest founded at Vanderbilt has attracted brilliant 
archeologists and graduate students capable of translating 1,500-year-old 
hieroglyphics, but none ever conclusively identified the alien green broth that 
regularly passed for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Spam, tin, tools, lab equipment, field library, portable generator, mystery 
meals and some non-inventoried bottles of Scotch had been transported from the 
river on bony mules and horses, their bodies sucked nearly hollow by vampire 
bats. The hike takes three sweltering hours during the relatively dry season. 
When the June torrents commence, it becomes a boot-swallowing wade that 
requires at least twice that long. The dig season supposedly ends with the 
rains, but this year the rains came a month early. 
</P>
<P>
After long, mosquito-rich stretches of strangler vines and palmilla thickets, 
the path climbs a steep escarpment. Giant mahoganies, cedars, ceibas, 
chicle-bearing sapodillas and breadnut trees rise 200 feet from the thin 
tropical soils capping the limestone. Along the escarpment's ragged edge, the 
Maya built cities that Demarest's team has determined once formed an 
interlocking kingdom called the Petexbatun. Only a few years ago, the cities' 
relationship would have been impossible to divine. Breakthroughs in deciphering 
the language carved onto fragments of history that push up through the forest 
floor have changed everything. The area contains no less than seven major 
cities and 230 monuments, and Demarest intends to open them all. 
</P>
<P>
An hour away from the base camp, small mahogany-covered hills emerge on a rise 
between streams cutting through the escarpment. These are actually pyramids, 
built from chunks of local limestone hewn with chert adzes, now being reclaimed 
by the soil. This site, Arroyo de Piedra, is being excavated by a slim, mild 
25-year-old graduate student named David Stuart. The son of National Geographic 
archeologist George Stuart, he spent hours as a child first staring at, then 
drawing Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics. At 12 he delivered his first 
professional paper, titled "Observations on the T565 Glyph at Palenque." At 18, 
he became the youngest recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, for having 
revolutionized Mayan epigraphic interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest has Stuart digging garbage pits. "He's already an epigrapher. Now 
he'll be a field archeologist, too," Demarest says. Over dinner, Stuart and 
Steve Houston, another world-class glyph wizard Demarest lured to Vanderbilt's 
faculty, fill napkins with symbols. Fifteen years ago, epigraphers realized 
that Mayan glyphs could be phonetic as well as pictorial. Stuart made major 
advances in figuring out how the phonetic symbols connected; he and Houston now 
crack a new connection every few weeks. Their ability to read inscriptions on 
the stelae -- stone monoliths that stand in Mayan ceremonial plazas -- is 
responsible for Demarest's conclusion that, about AD 700, one of the Petexbatun 
city-states began to break the rules of restrained conflict. 
</P>
<P>
At Arroyo de Piedra, Stuart reads the dot-and-bar code that is the date on a 
huge, fallen stela; it corresponds to AD 715. The image is of a local 
chieftain, identified as the son of a vassal to a great lord from another city 
-- evidence that Arroyo de Piedra had fallen under someone else's dominion. The 
lord, whose actual name is yet undeciphered, is known as Ruler 2 of Dos Pilas. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pilas is where Demarest has spent $100,000 building one of the biggest 
archeological camps ever. The quadrangle of labs, mess hall, storeroom and 
cabins sits just off a plaza shaded by an overgrown knoll. The crumbling 
limestone blocks around its slopes were once a 100-foot-wide staircase; buried 
somewhere inside the thickly forested knoll is Dos Pilas' principal palace. The 
surrounding jungle, filled with chattering toucans and green parrots, is so 
dense that after Dos Pilas was discovered in the 1950s, 17 years passed before 
anyone noticed that a nearby hill was actually a 220-foot pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Across the grassy plaza, cleared by workmen who play soccer here in the 
afternoons, is a smaller mound. A mossy stela found in front of it shows a 
warrior in a huge headdress, holding a shield and standing on the back of a 
bound human captive. The warrior is Ruler 2 himself; Stuart and Houston have 
concluded that he is probably buried under the mound. With his National 
Geographic benefactors expecting a prime-time TV documentary, Demarest realizes 
that this is the point in his career when he must defer his fascination for 
ancient trash pits and open a royal tomb. When he stumbles back into camp after 
five days of hacking through the ubiquitous red tape in Guatemala City, he 
checks with workers tunneling into the face of the mound: So far, nothing, they 
tell him. 
</P>
<P>
There is other news: Julio Ruana is lost again. "Is the dog with him?" Demarest 
asks. It is -- a relief -- but so is the team of cave specialists who just 
arrived from the United States to see the dog's latest momentous discovery. 
They were due back hours ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ruana lives in Nacimiento, a nearby squatters' village. The settlers are 
Mayan-Kekchi-speaking refugees from the highlands who fled counterinsurgency 
attacks. The doctor whom Demarest brought down, ostensibly as insurance against 
pit vipers, is mainly here to treat Nacimiento's malaria, tuberculosis and 
other woes. The workmen's salaries, at $5 a day high by Guatemalan standards, 
help alleviate malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Ruana is getting paid for getting lost. In two weeks, he has found 
seven caves, usually when his skinny white mongrel, Rapido, chases a 
tepezquintle into holes wide enough for Ruana to squeeze into. That night, when 
the muddy cave team struggles back in, the specialists are awe-struck. Ruana 
never located the cave he originally wanted them to see, but Rapido turned up 
yet another. This one extends for at least two kilometers and is paved with 
hundreds of pots: some four feet high, some covered with ornate polychrome, 
some incised, some with stalagmites growing out of them. 
</P>
<P>
Caves were believed to be passages to the underworld where earth deities dwelt 
and where rain was formed. Against the din of an immense downpour clanging on 
the tin roof, archeologist Jim Brady keeps repeating that he's just entered a 
place where no human being had been for a thousand years, filled with ceramics, 
jade, flint and human remains. "One of the greatest Mayan caves," he marvels, 
wiping clay from his goatee. Over the next few weeks, Ruana finds more new 
grottoes, including one where he thinks he saw wall paintings, rare among the 
Maya, except he lost his flashlight while fleeing a jaguar prowling inside. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, already overwhelmed with the ceramic-filled cornucopia they've dubbed 
Cueva de Sangre, doesn't even want to know any more. Cueva de Sangre also 
contains a lake holding skeletons that might have been sacrifices, a 
speculation strengthened by a nearby cache of carved stingray spines. These 
implements were used in ritual bloodletting, specifically to lacerate the penis 
-- a practice with variations, including circumcision, that appear in many 
parts of the world. The Maya believed that the soul resides in the blood; 
propitiating God with the gift of life was considered necessary to keep the 
calendar turning. 
</P>
<P>
In Mayan iconography, rulers are depicted with their hands under their 
loincloths, scattering droplets. It was Stuart who, at age 15, spotted the link 
that suggested that the droplets were not corn, water or semen but their own 
blood -- and, symbolically, that of their forebears. Sometimes the queens 
joined in the mutilation, pulling a rope through a perforation in their 
tongues. The blood was collected on bark paper, which was then burned to 
release its spirit. With the aid of mushrooms and hallucinogenic enemas, 
royalty would gaze into the smoke and confer with their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"Often," Demarest notes, "their ancestors would tell them to go to war." Their 
wars, frequently adhering to astrological cycles, at first impression seem 
singularly grisly. A member of an opposing royal family would be captured, 
ritually bled, and sometimes kept captive and paraded in humiliation for years. 
Eventually, his heart would be ripped out, or he would be decapitated or 
tortured to death. At Dos Pilas, one victim was tightly rolled and bound and 
then used for a game on the ceremonial ball court until his back was broken. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet," Demarest argues, "there was relatively no societal trauma, no 
destruction of fields and buildings or territories taken. It was a way of 
maintaining peace through constant, low-grade warfare that released tensions 
between leaders without endangering the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
The system functioned for centuries throughout the lowlands, until it began to 
break down, first at Dos Pilas. Thus far, Demarest's team knows this: By the 
mid-7th Century, Tikal had entered a profound stagnation. Nearly 50,000 people 
were living there, yet no new monuments had been erected for decades. But 65 
miles away, at Dos Pilas, a new kingdom had adopted Tikal's emblem glyph -- a 
top-knot of hair -- thus laying claim to its heritage. Two wars with Tikal 
followed. After the second led to a great triumph, both were commemorated on an 
elaborate Dos Pilas staircase, its steps richly carved with hieroglyphics. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a proper ritual war involving no loss of territory. The son of 
the defeated Tikal king ascended to the throne, and Tikal entered a 
renaissance. The Dos Pilas monarch, Ruler 1, also had a son who took over in AD 
690. Under Ruler 2, the influence of Dos Pilas expanded through marriage. His 
sister became the queen of the distant city-state Naranjo and another woman -- 
probably his daughter -- became ensconced at Tamarindito. Stelae began 
appearing in which the artistic flair of local sculptors was replaced by stiff, 
military realism. And one of the stelae now identified Ruler 2 of Dos Pilas as 
the overlord of Tamarindito. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of Ruler 3, it was apparent that Dos Pilas had become an 
aggressive power. Ruler 3 usurped the important center of Seibal -- a stela in 
Dos Pilas shows him resplendent in jaguar-skin boots, with the forlorn, naked 
king of Seibal helpless under his feet. An exact duplicate was also erected at 
Aguateca, a fortresslike site on a bluff high above Lake Petexbatun, reached by 
a natural bridge over a deep chasm. Stretching even farther, Ruler 3 brought 
back a second wife from Cancuen. The Lady of Cancuen was eventually buried in a 
magnificent tomb, recently opened at Dos Pilas, where she was found with a 
mouthful of jade. 
</P>
<P>
Ruler 4 was the greatest imperialist of all, conquering the entire Petexbatun 
and beyond. He stretched his domain to more than three times the normal size of 
a classic Mayan kingdom. Then, with his unexpected death in AD 760 at the hands 
of rebels from Tamarindito, the empire suddenly imploded. 
</P>
<P>
Rulers 5 and 6 apparently spent their reigns cowering in the isolated safety of 
Aguateca. Seibal was taken over by invaders, whose fine orange pottery 
indicates that they were from somewhere in Mexico. Under their dominion, Seibal 
flourished when everything else had collapsed. Then it, too, was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
A remarkable archeological find bears witness to the grim ending of Dos Pilas 
itself. After Ruler 4's defeat, the people, who lived in wide, concentric rings 
around the city, erected a village in the middle of the ceremonial plaza. The 
wall they threw up around their compound was made from decorative facing 
materials ripped from Ruler 2's tomb and from the principal palace. It was the 
equivalent of tearing down the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial to 
fortify a tent city on the Capitol Mall. 
</P>
<P>
This defensive barrier, first mapped by Steve Houston in 1986 while working on 
his doctoral dissertation, clinched Demarest's decision to launch his 
exhaustive study at Dos Pilas. The citizens of Dos Pilas, either beyond 
revering or thoroughly outraged by the memory of their greedy former rulers, 
buried the magnificent carved hieroglyphic triumphal staircase so deeply that 
no one knew it existed until almost 2,000 years later, when Vanderbilt graduate 
student Stacey Symonds uncovered it this past season while looking for a gate 
in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? DID THE MOUNTING populations gradually exhaust the land, 
tempting the Petexbatun rulers to seize their neighbors' property -- a move 
leading to a cycle of response that spiraled into total war? 
</P>
<P>
Or did increasing belligerence between cities cause each to abandon vulnerable 
outlying fields and intensify production closer to home, eventually pushing 
land beyond its tolerance? 
</P>
<P>
In the screened field laboratory at Dos Pilas, archeologists wearing faded 
T-shirts from previous digs ("Proyecto Arqueologico el Mesak: Keeping the Dead 
Alive") ponder exponentially expanding piles of clues. Two young Guatemalan 
graduate students, Claudia Wooley and Barbara Arroyo, become dazed poring over 
hundreds of drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Antonia Foias, whose family escaped from Romania 11 years ago, peers at bits of 
cross-hatched polychrome. She never dreamed she'd one day be in the jungles of 
Guatemala, drenched with insect repellent, with more than 1 million pottery 
sherds heaped between her and her doctorate. Over the next five years she will 
work with Ron Bishop, a ceramics specialist Demarest recruited from the 
Smithsonian, identifying trade patterns to verify how much of the imperial 
history recorded on the stelae is accurate and how much is propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Lori Wright and Hector Escobedo argue over whether the human bone 
crumbs he is finding atop a large pyramid indicate sacrifice or cremation. 
Wright's specialty is archeo-osteology, examining bones for telltale scars left 
by specific diseases or for genetic markers that may indicate whether residents 
of different sites were biologically related. She will especially seek evidence 
about nutrition, since changes in diet preceding the collapse would signify a 
break in the pattern of food production. 
</P>
<P>
To know whether war ruined the environment or gradual environmental decline led 
to war, archeologists must first settle an issue that plagues the entire planet 
these days: How could anyone grow food in a tropical rain forest without 
destroying it? 
</P>
<P>
Nick Dunning did his doctoral work in the Yucatan, examining the romantic image 
of Mayan super-managers cultivating an enormous tropical breadbasket. During 
the next several years, Dunning will place thousands of pinches of dirt on 
filter paper, add reagents and, within minutes, determine the dirt's relative 
quantity of phosphates. The simple test reveals soil use: organic refuse such 
as garbage, human feces or mulch mineralizes quickly, leaving identifiable 
phosphate fingerprints of hidden dwellings, kitchen gardens and ancient fields. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning will drive tubes into lake bottoms to extract core samples layered with 
centuries of pollen that drained from the forest and from whatever crops that 
were cultivated. He will train computers to analyze satellite maps of 
vegetative cover, conduct oblique-angle photographic aerial surveys and walk 
transect lines from site to site, sampling along horizontal ribs at least every 
100 meters, to find every field he can. 
</P>
<P>
"We will know what happened in the Petexbatun. It may not be the same 
throughout the lowlands," he adds, which reflects the intelligent diversity of 
Mayan methods he has already observed. On hillsides, the Maya built walls to 
trap rich humus from runoff water in cultivation terraces. Along lakes and 
riverbeds, they dug ditches to drain swamps, heaping the soil they removed to 
create fertile raised fields. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, they mimicked the rain forest, providing layers of shade for 
diverse crops. Rows of corn and beans would shade a ground cover of melons and 
squash; fruit trees, in turn, sheltered them, and protective patches of the 
forest itself would be left among fields periodically burned for cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Partly, it was a happy accident. Without chain saws, they had to leave the 
biggest trees," Dunning says. That is exactly what hasn't happened at doleful 
Nacimiento. A logging road growing at 30 kilometers per year has reached the 
area; streams of flatbed trailers are carrying away cedar and mahogany and 
knocking everything else down in their way. Dunning and Demarest have explained 
all this to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
Their paleo-ecological sleuthing will henceforth also be funded by USAID, with 
something extra to add both more work and satisfaction: a program to teach 
displaced highland Indians the local techniques of their lowland cousins and 
forebears. 
</P>
<P>
ARTHUR DEMAREST STANDS IN THE main plaza of Aguateca, the fortified capital of 
Dos Pilas' late rulers, accompanied by students Stacey Symonds and Takeshi 
Inomata. Symonds shows him a garbage midden filled with corn-grinding metates 
and domestic pottery sherds. Demarest frowns; there shouldn't be a trash pit in 
this spot. Before them is a huge, U-shaped structure with a steep staircase 
leading to the throne where Ruler 4 once sat, fierce in his jaguar skins, and 
received the panting, terrified subjects who had climbed the stairs to bow 
before him. Dunning hasn't ruled out that environmental strains due to 
population pressure might have triggered the Dos Pilas dynasty's hostile land 
grabs, but Demarest is more convinced than ever that it was the other way 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem wasn't too many people," Demarest says. "But society had evolved 
too many elites." 
</P>
<P>
He describes a culture wobbling under the weight of an excess of nobles, all 
requiring quetzal feathers, jade, obsidian, fine chert, fancy corbeled roofs 
and animal furs. In the Petexbatun kingdom, aristocracy was swollen further by 
polygamy: "Too many heirs wanted thrones, or needed some ritual bloodletting to 
confirm their stature. Inevitably, dynastic warfare heightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Any society that depends on growth economics, with elites demanding 
ever-greater levels of material well-being, eventually reaches its limits," he 
says. As more temples need building, a higher caloric demand on workers 
requires more food production. Population rises to ensure enough food 
producers. Constant warfare -- as demonstrated in Aztec, Inca and Chinese 
empires -- also increases population, because rulers require soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
As stakes rise, trade is disrupted and settlement patterns change. Population 
begins to concentrate, something potentially lethal in a rain forest. 
Investment in long-term crops dwindles. Refugees now living behind defensive 
walls farm only adjacent areas, inviting ecological disaster. Their confidence 
in leaders declines with their quality of life. They lose faith. Ritual 
activity ceases. 
</P>
<P>
It is a hypothesis that must be tested rigorously. But at nearby Lake 
Petexbatun, the team has stumbled onto a portent of what Demarest expects to 
find over the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
On a peninsula called Punta de Chimino, a Mayan ruin that Inomata was mapping 
turned out to be a compact fortress city. The peninsula had been severed from 
the mainland by three moats, one cutting so deeply into bedrock that digging it 
required three times the energy used to build the city itself -- "the 
equivalent," Demarest observes, "of spending 75% of a nation's budget on 
defense." This was a society out of control. The spear points imbedded in the 
fortress walls testify to the fate of whoever ended up in Punta de Chimino. 
"When you examine societies just as self-confident as ours, which unraveled and 
were eventually swallowed by the jungle," says Arthur Demarest, "you see that 
we can blow it, too. The balance between ecology and society is exquisitely 
delicate. If something throws that delicate balance off, it all can end." 
</P>
<P>
He stoops and picks a sherd from the moist ground. "Two thousand years later," 
he adds, "people will be squinting over the fragments, trying to find out what 
went wrong." 
</P>

TRAVELER'S DIARY: INTRIGUING RUINS AT COBA AND TULUM

<P>
Today we breached the jungle at the "Queen City of the Yucatan," hub of a 
civilization that lasted for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
First explorations of the area were made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but 
this once-vast city, most of whose estimated 6,500 structures remain hidden 
beneath a tangle of rain forest, did not really begin to be uncovered until 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
Maryknoll sisters arranged medicine and food drops until a landing strip was 
peeled away. Now, there is a road, and travelers who want a break from Cancun, 
roughly 100 miles away, can rumble in by bus. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other discoveries they will make at the end of a longish tramp along 
jungle trails is the Nohoch Mul pyramid, more than 120 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 120 aching steps to reach the top. But from that lofty perch one can 
survey pyramid mounds that rise above the plain and are especially visible when 
sunrise or sunset casts shadows over the endless carpet of green. 
</P>
<P>
Just to the left of Nohoch Mul is a 400-foot square leveled terrace bearing 
evidence of houses that once stood on what the archeologists call "The Great 
Platform." 
</P>
<P>
Near the plaza in front of the pyramid is a stele, or tablet, depicting a Mayan 
ruler standing atop two kneeling slaves, with two other slaves kneeling nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan culture endures, and candlesticks, money and flowers are often placed 
at the foot of monuments. Some of the stelae, covered now by straw canopies, 
are 10 to 15 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Conveniently -- albeit almost incongruously -- a Club Med has risen at Coba. 
</P>
<P>
A two-story inn encircles a swimming pool and overlooks a thatched-roof 
pavilion. It offers air-conditioned rooms at $42 a night double occupancy, with 
breakfast an additional $5. 
</P>
<P>
Coba lies at the hub of several dozen ancient roads, one of them stretching 
almost 60 miles. These highways, both ceremonial and utilitarian, once formed 
the largest network in North America. 
</P>
<P>
A new 30-mile stretch from the inland jungle leads to the walled seaside city 
of Tulum. 
</P>
<P>
Our guide, Raul, insisted that Tulum does not mean "wall" as some believe, but 
rather "evil-smelling ground," a sobriquet it earned because of its location 
above and around mangrove swamps. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city was also called Zama, meaning dawn, and that, too, makes sense 
because from Tulum's clifftop perch one can see the sun rising out of the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Tulum, open and visible, with no hint of jungle to impair the view of its 
ruins, belongs to a period, perhaps AD 700 to 1000, when the Mayan civilization 
was already in decline. The earliest-known stela here is said to date from AD 
564, but there is some argument on this point; some insist that the tablet was 
carved elsewhere and transported here. 
</P>
<P>
There is little argument that the city-fort was constructed three centuries 
before the Spaniards first came ashore in 1518. The Spanish, viewing the city, 
called its most imposing structure El Castillo, the castle. 
</P>
<P>
Buses and rental cars are available daily in Cancun for the visit to Tulum with 
its myriad souvenir shacks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the 30-mile spur road to Coba and the promise of its little inn, 
Tulum and Coba make for an unforgettable if somewhat exhausting trip.

<HEAD>Mexican Government Recovers More Stolen Treasure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has recovered more gold, jade
and stone artifacts that were stolen from the National Museum of
Archaeology in a daring Christmas Day robbery in 1985, an official
said.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said one of the 19
pieces of jewelry found Friday was among the most important of all
the stolen items.
   Authorities recovered 111 items last weekend. On Wednesday
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari presided over a ceremony
returning them to the museum.
   The artifacts date from 500 B.C. to 2500 B.C. and include masks
and jewelry from Mexico's ancient Aztec, Mixteca, Maya and Zapotec
civilizations. About 25 items still are missing.
   Federal agents in Mexico City followed one man, Carlos Perches
Trevino, 24, for 45 days before his arrest on June 9, Alvarez said
earlier this week. He said officials were seeking another man,
identified as Ramon Sardina Garcia.
   Sardina left a box of tools at the home of a friend, Maria
Antonieta Ponce Mercado, who became suspicious after learning of the
man's alleged involvement in the museum robbery and told her uncle,
Alvarez said. The uncle contacted the attorney general's office on
Friday.
   Alvarez said federal agents and museum officials went to Ms.
Ponce's house in a Mexico City suburb and found 19 pieces of jewelry
in the box.
   ``Among what we found was one of the five most important missing
pieces, a figure of a Mayan governor,'' he said Friday night.
   Alvarez said earlier this week that Perches and Sardina had
staked out the museum for six months. The pair then jumped the
fence, crawled in through an air conditioning duct and looted seven
display cases, he said.
   The attorney general said the men kept the artifacts for more
than a year, then exchanged some for drugs.

HALF HIDDEN AMID THE TANGLED GROWTH OF CENTURIES, THE ANCIENT MAYAN CITY OFFERS 
NOT ONLY THE TALLEST PYRAMID IN YUCATAN BUT ALSO THE CHANCE TO EXPLORE AN 
ARCHEOLOGICAL WONDER STILL UNSPOILED BY CROWDS OF TOURISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Living in a city with its smog and its traffic, one forgets about clean air and 
space -- and butterflies. Especially butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
But in the jungles of the Yucatan peninsula, butterflies -- mariposas en 
espanol -- swarm everywhere, fluttering aimlessly across country roads like 
troupes of graceful ballerinas. And here in Coba, once one of the largest and 
most splendid of the great Mayan cities, amateur archeologists, with no more 
effort than a 10-minute hike, can see scores of the brightly colored creatures 
at certain times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The jungles of the Yucatan can be unbearably hot and humid, but sighting these 
spectacular butterflies alone makes for a worthwhile journey. Coba has far more 
to offer than just mariposas, however. 
</P>
<P>
It takes planning to get here, though. For starters, one needs a rental car 
(traveling from Cancun or Merida), a full tank of gas and a willingness to 
venture a few steps off the well-beaten tourist path. Coba is about 90 miles 
from Cancun, about 150 miles from Merida. 
</P>
<P>
It's also wise to bring along a can of extra-strength mosquito repellent, and 
it helps to have a built-in tolerance for heat. But the rewards -- the 
butterflies, the solitude, the intense jungle silence and the tallest pyramid 
in the Yucatan -- are worth any inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
Coba is not Chichen Itza. The ruins don't measure up -- not in size, nor scope, 
nor perfection. No one on holiday in the Yucatan should miss Chichen Itza. But 
to its credit, Coba is free of Chichen Itza's almost Disneyland-like 
atmosphere. Missing are the busloads of loudly dressed tourists milling in 
hordes around the ruins. In Coba, you are generally on your own when you climb 
a pyramid. Once at the top, you can survey the jungle alone. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the tenor of your Yucatan vacation changes dramatically as soon as you 
turn off the main coastal highway that carries tourists from Cancun to Tulum, a 
distance of about 90 miles. From Tulum and its ruined walled fortress on the 
turquoise Caribbean, a two-lane, freshly paved road moves northwest into the 
thick Yucatan jungle. Hundreds of cars and buses jockey for position on the 
main highway, but during the hour or so that it takes to travel the 35 miles 
from Tulum to Coba, traffic is sparse. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the road, in an occasional clearing, mud-and-straw-hut villages house 
the descendants of Indians who built the great Mayan cities more than 1,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise there are only tangled trees and impenetrable scrub. Occasionally a 
pig or a mule will saunter slowly across the road, but otherwise there is 
little sign of life. En route to Coba there are no gas stations and no 
telephones. Not even a Coke machine. 
</P>
<P>
Just when you begin to feel that perhaps the map and the tour books are 
incorrect, that you may be on the wrong road, you come upon the sign that 
reads: Coba. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God," you'll probably say with a sigh. "Civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In the village of several one-story stucco buildings, entrepreneurs sell cheap 
souvenirs, and an air-conditioned hotel, the Villa Arqueologica Coba, provides 
shelter for about $35 double. The hotel has a swimming pool, a restaurant and a 
library of books on local history and archeology. 
</P>
<P>
Coba was founded about 1,300 years ago near a pair of lakes. The hotel 
overlooks one of the lakes, and a 10-minute walk along the shore brings you to 
the ruins, or at least those that have so far been uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
The entry fee, payable at a shack near the entrance, is about 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Just inside and to the right of the entry gate, the Grupo Coba boasts a 
towering pyramid of jagged gray rocks. Climbing the narrow steps can be 
treacherous, and by the time you reach the top you'll be thankful for having 
taken along a canteen of water. 
</P>
<P>
From atop the pyramid, both lakes come into sharp focus. Surrounding them, 
stretching in every direction, is a sea of foliage in various shades of green 
and brown. To one side, another pyramid, Nohoch Mul, juts into the sky, high 
above the jungle and the narrow, muddy path that leads to its base. 
</P>
<P>
The pyramid of Nohoch Mul towers more than 100 feet above the jungle floor -- 
taller than the spectacular El Castillo at Chichen Itza and the Pyramid of the 
Magician at Uxmal. 
</P>
<P>
In their present state, the 1,300-year-old pyramids of Coba don't sport the 
precision of the perfect, four-sided structures at Chichen Itza. They seem, 
rather, to have been built into hills, with steps leading up only the front 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The architecture of Coba, in fact, owes more to the style of the great Mayan 
cities of Tikal in Guatemala and Copan in Honduras than to the 
Toltec-influenced pyramids of nearby Chichen Itza that came along about 500 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
Nohoch Mul is a 15-minute jungle walk from Grupo Coba, and the view from its 
top is equally spectacular -- tangled foliage stretches for as far as you can 
see, much of it hiding ruins and roadways still to be uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the great Mayan cities were abandoned to the jungle about 1,000 years 
ago. No one is certain whether an epidemic, earthquake, overpopulation or a 
general breakdown of the social fabric caused the collapse of this great 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring Coba is tiring, the heat is blistering and the mosquitoes are 
merciless. After a good two hours of baking in this outdoor sauna, you'll yearn 
for a dip in the hotel pool. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Coba, a 45-minute drive north will deliver you to the main Yucatan 
highway connecting Cancun and Merida. A left turn and an hour and a half more 
will take you to Chichen Itza. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days amid the unparalleled ruins, pyramid, ball court and 
observatory at Chichen Itza will satisfy any hunger for more Mayan mystery. 
</P>
<P>
But even Chichen Itza's magnificent sights will not erase the memory of those 
quieter, perhaps more elemental ruins at Coba. The jungle trails. The uncrowded 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
And the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
The only hotel in Coba is the Club Med-owned Villa Arqueologica Coba, which has 
air-conditioned doubles for about $35 a night. The hotel also has a swimming 
pool, restaurant and bar. For reservations, write to Hoteles Villa Arqueologica 
Coba, Avenida Masaryk 183, Mexico City, Mexico DF 11570. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the village residents offer primitive accommodations for much less. 
</P>
<P>
Daily flights to Cancun from Los Angeles are available on Mexicana and Delta 
Airlines for about $350 round trip. Nissan Sentras, Volkswagen Bugs and Jeeps 
can be rented at the Cancun airport for about $40 a day. Larger cars are 
significantly more expensive.

NEW MAYAN ALPHABET PROVOKES ANGRY LETTERS

Almost 1,000 letters and telegrams from people in rural villages, mountains and 
valleys sit on Jose Sanic's desk at the Academy of Mayan Languages in Guatemala 
City. Many warn of serious consequences if a new alphabet for the country's 22 
Mayan languages changes the letters used to represent "w," "q" and "k." Sanic 
smiles wryly and says he is confident that the law will stick and that it is 
the beginning of a resolution to Guatemala's "Indian problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mayans, who prefer the term indigena (native) to Indian, are the majority of 
Guatemala's 8 million people. No more than 600,000 Mayans can read and write in 
any language at any level. In schools where teachers used Spanish, indigenous 
children were thrown into what Eliu Cifuentes, Guatemala's director of 
bilingual education, calls "a violent encounter with literacy, being taught a 
foreign language by a teacher who doesn't speak their tongue." 
</P>
<P>
With President Vinicio Cerezo's election in 1985, the government announced a 
radical change in policy. Spanish will remain the official language, but 
Guatemala will have at least 22 protected languages. As a symbol of its 
commitment to Mayan culture, the government published its new constitution in 
the languages of the four largest Mayan groups -- Mam, Kaqchikel, K'iche' and 
Q'eqchi'. 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual education program, begun as an experiment with funds from the 
United States Agency for International Development, includes 400 schools with 
bilingual classes up to the fourth grade. Cifuentes expects 260,000 students to 
be in the program this year. This would represent more than one-third of all 
rural primary school students. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of so many new readers and writers inspired activists to push for 
what they hoped would be a truly Mayan alphabet. Previous efforts to teach 
Mayan were hobbled by a variety of alphabets, most invented by Europeans and 
North Americans. Many used symbols not found on a typewriter or in a print 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the election, Mayans and their friends in Congress created the 
Academy of Mayan Languages within the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The 
academy's first project was to create a unified Mayan alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
During several meetings organized by the academy, most of the debate focused on 
the letters "w," "k" and "q." In the new alphabet, "w" represents sounds 
previously written with "cua," "gu," "qu" and "v." Sounds previously assigned 
to "q" and "k" in most alphabets were reversed, and the European "qu" has 
disappeared. The Aguacateca are now the Awakateka. The Quiche are now the 
K'iche' (the apostrophe indicates a glottal stop). 
</P>
<P>
Many find no fault with the new alphabet's method of equating one letter to one 
sound -- a generally accepted principle among linguists concerned about 
teaching. But debate over the new alphabet is only one part linguistic; it's 
also political and economic. 
</P>
<P>
At the academy, Sanic said, most of the mail on his desk comes from members of 
evangelical Protestant churches, which claim almost 20% of Guatemala's 
population as members. In many communities, evangelicals and their Mayan 
congregations have a large economic and public relations stake in materials 
published using earlier alphabets. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan activists say it is more important to seize the political opportunities 
than to worry about what they consider nit-picking. Virgilio Ajenal, director 
of the Assn. of Mayan Writers, contended: "The fight is mainly among 
intellectuals. . . . Ninety-nine and nine-tenths of all indigenous people are 
still illiterate, so they will not have to learn anything over." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mayans have listened to outsiders too long. "We don't want outsiders to 
think, to decide and to act for us." As for the value of the material already 
printed, most of it religious, he said: "The people in the countryside cannot 
eat those things." It is time to write practical, how-to-do-it things about 
agriculture and health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliot, director of the Center for Mesoamerican Investigations in 
Antigua, said the need to get on with the new alphabet is exemplified by three 
proposals he received during a week in May. Each asked for help in publishing a 
dictionary of Kaqchikel, each in its own alphabet. "If the energy invested in 
opposing the alphabet were invested in promoting the transition, it would be 
over with," Elliot said. He sums up the debate saying, "It's a matter of what's 
important to us -- the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes said the country is "trying to find a new national identity." The new 
alphabet is an important part of the process. "We are beginning to end the 
colonization of the language that began 400 years ago," he said.

<LEADPARA>  WEARY of burning your retinas on the same old Mexican beach vacation? How
about a visit to "El Mundo Maya" instead?;    If it's a phrase you haven't
heard yet, be prepared: El Mundo Maya -- the world of the Maya -- is one of
the waves of the future in vacation travel to Mexico and Central America. You
may also hear it referred to as "La Ruta Maya," the route of the Maya, but the
idea is similar -- travel to the developed and undeveloped Mayan sites in
Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And there are hundreds of them, stretching from heavily visited places,
such as Tulum in Mexico's Yucatan, to Tikal in Guatemala, Copan in Honduras
and lesser-known sites in war-torn El Salvador.;    Whether Mundo Maya or Ruta
Maya, the words will most likely also be linked to what has already become one
of the big trends in travel for the 1990s: ecotourism. Ecotourism basically
means environmentally sensitive and socially conscious travel to wilderness
areas, especially those in underdeveloped parts of the world.;    The
underlying idea is that such travel, if it is well-managed, can prevent damage
to pristine areas, while generating enough income to keep the natives from
ravaging the same environment -- rain forests, for example -- to eke out a
living.;    In the last two years, a series of meetings among commercial and
governmental tourism officials in the five nations has found general accord
with linking tourists on a Mayan route through Mexico and parts of Central
America. It even seems likely that a Mundo Maya "passport" will be created at
some point, to ease travel among the nations.;    But the concern of many
environmentalists is that El Mundo Maya will simply become another way for
Mexico to generate tourist dollars.;    The commercial operators are "more
concerned with tourism, and we're more concerned with preservation," says Bill
Garrett, founder and president of La Ruta Maya Conservation Foundation and a
former editor of National Geographic. Garrett wrote an article for the October
1989 Geographic that outlined ambitious plans to preserve and protect the
Mayan sites and their surrounding rain forests and preserves.;    Garrett
recalls watching in horror as guides ran boats close to a huge flock of
flamingos near Celestun in the Gulf of Mexico, and made loud noises to spook
the birds into flight so tourists on the boats could get better pictures.
That's ecoterrorism, not ecotourism, he says.;    "At some point, they're
going to have to enforce the rules," Garrett says. "Most tourists aren't going
to get mad and go home if you say, 'Don't break the rules.' ";     IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; Those seeking a reliable ecotourism operator can purchase the

Travel Network, 81868 Lost Valley Lane, Dexter, Ore. 97431; (503) 937-3351. A

Authorities in Mexico City have recovered scores of priceless jade, gold and 
stone artifacts taken in the 1985 Christmas Day robbery of the National Museum 
of Anthropology. Federal agents found 133 of the 140 stolen treasures from the 
ancient Mayan, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations in canvas sacks stashed 
in a home in suburban Mexico City. Ten people were arrested after a series of 
raids on several residences. Among the items recovered were a Zapotec mask of 
the bat god Murielago and an obsidian Aztec sculpture of a monkey. Experts have 
described them as two of the most valuable pieces in a museum crammed with 
irreplaceable objects from civilizations dating back thousands of years. ALEENE

EXTRATERRESTRIALS 'COMING BACK TO LOOK FOR ANCIENT MAYANS';

UFO MANIA SWEEPS GUATEMALA, KEEPING EYES FIXED ON THE NIGHT SKY

<TEXT>
<P>
UFO mania is sweeping this Central American nation, sending thousands of people 
each night out into the cold, dark mountains hoping for a glimpse of 
extraterrestrials. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of night sightings by upstanding citizens, not thought to be psychotic 
or prone to heavy drinking, have captured the imagination of the country of 8.7 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, local papers report sightings by doctors, lawyers, students and even 
government officials. Conversation on the streets of Guatemala City invariably 
turns to the phenomenon, with a wide range of opinions about what the strange 
objects might actually be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ETs (extraterrestrials) are coming back to look for the ancient 
Mayans, with whom they had contact centuries ago," said Joaquin Lopez Bonilla, 
a 20-year-old student at the capital's San Carlos University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looking for Tikal' 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for Tikal, I am sure," he said, referring to the resplendent 
ancient Mayan capital, now a major archeological site about 200 miles north of 
Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"These so-called sightings are nothing more than drug-traffickers who operate 
small craft at night," said Nario Pineda, a businessman from the town of 
Antigua, just outside the capital. "They make all kinds of strange maneuvers in 
order to avoid radar and the police," 
</P>
<P>
But for those who claim to have seen the UFOs, nothing can dissuade them from 
their belief. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them and so did 12 of my friends, so I know I am not crazy," said Juan 
Carlos del Monte, 28. "We saw two red lights far off in the distance. They 
seemed to be playing around out in space. Then, suddenly, one began to move. 
Within 30 seconds it was flying practically over our heads. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bigger than a jumbo jet, and it did not make a sound. It was circular 
in shape, with one red light and three amber lights," Del Monte said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Monte was interviewed 40 miles northeast of Guatemala City along the 
highway that leads to the Caribbean coast. The area, near the town of El 
Progresso, has produced by far the richest number of sightings, although UFOs 
have been reported in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Time 
</P>
<P>
In El Progresso, the UFOs reportedly appear between 7:45 and 8:15 p.m. The most 
common time for their appearance is exactly at 7:56 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night, the highway was lined with hundreds of cars, each jam-packed 
with children, dogs, grandparents and whoever else wanted to see the UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
Many people wrapped up tightly against the cold winter chill of the desolate 
mountains and milled about, comparing tales of past sightings. Dozens of 
telescopes and binoculars pointed toward the clear black sky. 
</P>
<P>
One man, using a portable electric organ, played the famous five-note tune made 
popular from the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." 
</P>
<P>
"They are out there; they can hear me," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
On that night, however, the UFOs did not appear. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people here now," said one disgruntled observer, who said 
he had come to El Progresso every night for a week. "All the car lights and 
cumbia music (a lilting form of 'salsa')) are scaring the Martians away." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been like this every night for the past few days," said one police 
officer, who was sent to El Progresso to make sure that the highway was not 
blocked by the crowd. "Thousands of them come up from the capital to see the 
UFOs. It's a big party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Times 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen the UFOs three times," he said, adding that he did not want to 
give his name because "otherwise, they will think I am crazy down at 
headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
But the government is apparently not taking the UFO craze lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't fully discount the sightings, in fact, we're a little concerned," a 
Defense Ministry spokesman said. "But there is no proof of anything," 
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of military and police agencies were investigating the 
reports and that the agencies were "keeping an eye out for the UFOs ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
"We have four observation posts set up around El Progresso," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan was not immune to UFO mania. One 
night recently, he and an entourage of aides spent several hours near El 
Progresso, heads turned skyward. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not see a thing," the minister told reporters the next day. "I am very 
disappointed, but I will be back again," 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the craze continues. 
</P>
<P>
Local merchants are running radio ads claiming that ETs came to Guatemala to 
buy their products, while T-shirts, banners and graffiti cry out: "Welcome to 
Central America UFOs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrive Late 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to be a bit much. We are going to suffer if this continues," said 
one bank manager in Guatemala City, adding that several of his employees "have 
been coming in late in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
"They stay out in El Progresso until very late and cannot get up in time the 
next day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as long as the sightings continue, Guatemalans will keep looking skyward at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most exciting thing that has happened here in years," Del Monte 
said. "It is better than the Pope's visit in 1985."

NEW MAYAN ALPHABET PROVOKES ANGRY LETTERS

<P>
Almost 1,000 letters and telegrams from people in rural villages, mountains and 
valleys sit on Jose Sanic's desk at the Academy of Mayan Languages in Guatemala 
City. Many warn of serious consequences if a new alphabet for the country's 22 
Mayan languages changes the letters used to represent "w," "q" and "k." Sanic 
smiles wryly and says he is confident that the law will stick and that it is 
the beginning of a resolution to Guatemala's "Indian problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mayans, who prefer the term indigena (native) to Indian, are the majority of 
Guatemala's 8 million people. No more than 600,000 Mayans can read and write in 
any language at any level. In schools where teachers used Spanish, indigenous 
children were thrown into what Eliu Cifuentes, Guatemala's director of 
bilingual education, calls "a violent encounter with literacy, being taught a 
foreign language by a teacher who doesn't speak their tongue." 
</P>
<P>
With President Vinicio Cerezo's election in 1985, the government announced a 
radical change in policy. Spanish will remain the official language, but 
Guatemala will have at least 22 protected languages. As a symbol of its 
commitment to Mayan culture, the government published its new constitution in 
the languages of the four largest Mayan groups -- Mam, Kaqchikel, K'iche' and 
Q'eqchi'. 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual education program, begun as an experiment with funds from the 
United States Agency for International Development, includes 400 schools with 
bilingual classes up to the fourth grade. Cifuentes expects 260,000 students to 
be in the program by 1990. This would represent more than one-third of all 
rural primary school students. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of so many new readers and writers inspired activists to push for 
what they hoped would be a truly Mayan alphabet. Previous efforts to teach 
Mayan were hobbled by a variety of alphabets, most invented by Europeans and 
North Americans. Many used symbols not found on a typewriter or in a print 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the election, Mayans and their friends in Congress created the 
Academy of Mayan Languages within the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The 
academy's first project was to create a unified Mayan alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
During several meetings organized by the academy, most of the debate focused on 
the letters "w," "k" and "q." In the new alphabet, "w" represents sounds 
previously written with "cua," "gu," "qu" and "v." Sounds previously assigned 
to "q" and "k" in most alphabets were reversed, and the European "qu" has 
disappeared. The Aguacateca are now the Awakateka. The Quiche are now the 
K'iche' (the apostrophe indicates a glottal stop). 
</P>
<P>
Many find no fault with the new alphabet's method of equating one letter to one 
sound -- a generally accepted principle among linguists concerned about 
teaching. But debate over the new alphabet is only one part linguistic; it's 
also political and economic. 
</P>
<P>
At the academy, Sanic said, most of the mail on his desk comes from members of 
evangelical Protestant churches, which claim almost 20% of Guatemala's 
population as members. In many communities, evangelicals and their Mayan 
congregations have a large economic and public relations stake in materials 
published using earlier alphabets. 
</P>
<P>
Some consider the rapid adoption of the new alphabet a violation of human 
rights. A K'iche'-speaking senator, Diego Velasco Brito, lodged a formal 
complaint with Guatemala's attorney general for human rights. Abraham Garcia 
responded for the Assn. of Mayan Writers of Guatemala, a 10-year-old indigenous 
group that includes many teachers. He said the association had already begun to 
publish and teach the new alphabet. Its quarterly bulletin also uses the 
alphabet and, "to date, it has had a wonderful reception by readers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While a few proponents of the new alphabet worry about the evangelical 
preachers, they are disturbed by what they feel is professional opposition from 
the best-known organization of linguists, one that has translated most of the 
Christian materials used in evangelical churches as well as religious and 
secular material sold in the Mayan writers association's small bookstore. 
Linguists from the Summer Institute of Linguistics have done by far the largest 
amount of scholarly work on Mayan languages. Most of the dictionaries, school 
texts and books of Mayan stories published in indigenous languages bear the 
institute's imprint. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan activists say it is more important to seize the political opportunities 
than to worry about what they consider nit-picking. Virgilio Ajenal, director 
of the Assn. of Mayan Writers, contended: "The fight is mainly among 
intellectuals. . . . Ninety-nine and nine-tenths of all indigenous people are 
still illiterate, so they will not have to learn anything over." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mayans have listened to outsiders too long. "We don't want outsiders to 
think, to decide and to act for us." As for the value of the material already 
printed, most of it religious, he said: "The people in the countryside cannot 
eat those things." It is time to write practical, how-to-do-it things about 
agriculture and health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliot, director of the Center for Mesoamerican Investigations in 
Antigua, said the need to get on with the new alphabet is exemplified by three 
proposals he received during a week in May. Each asked for help in publishing a 
dictionary of Kaqchikel, each in its own alphabet. "If the energy invested in 
opposing the alphabet were invested in promoting the transition, it would be 
over with," Elliot said. He sums up the debate saying, "It's a matter of what's 
important to us -- the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes said the country is "trying to find a new national identity." The new 
alphabet is an important part of the process. "We are beginning to end the 
colonization of the language that began 400 years ago," he said.

The striking beauty of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs makes them 
irresistible from the very first glance. 
</P>
<P>
But their mysterious content is what keeps you looking. 
</P>
<P>
"Revelaciones: The Art of Manuel Alvarez Bravo," a retrospective of 113 
black-and-white photographs, opened last week at the Museum of Photographic 
Arts in Balboa Park and continues through Sept. 9. The show validates once more 
the 88-year-old Mexican artist's reputation as one of the greatest 
photographers of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by Arthur Ollman, the museum's executive director, along with Nissan 
Perez, curator of photographs at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, this 
exhibition is more than just a survey of Alvarez Bravo's work since the 1920s. 
It also is a reminder that sensuality and political content can easily coexist 
in a single image, that matters of life and death can be treated simultaneously 
with humor and pathos, and that a single work of art is capable of expressing 
vast numbers of layered meanings. 
</P>
<P>
"Public Thirst," for example, a work from 1933, shows a young boy crouching on 
a ledge to drink from an outdoor water fountain. It's an everyday image, hardly 
a grand statement. From his bearing, you get the feeling that the child is a 
resourceful character, but still, he's just an ordinary boy, barefooted yet 
well-dressed in wrinkled but clean white slacks and shirt. And Alvarez Bravo 
doesn't succumb to the pitfalls of cute 
</P>
<P>
ness that ruin so many pictures of children -- the boy's head is turned away, 
he is anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The work's title indicates that there's more to this image than the kind of 
ordinary incident that has preoccupied photographers like Henri 
Cartier-Bresson, for example. This boy, whose dark skin identifies him as a 
native Mexican, is one of Alvarez Bravo's symbols for the Mexican people. And 
yet, as Perez points out in his essay in the catalogue for the show, the boy 
also represents young Mayan boys who once were sacrificed to quench the thirst 
of their gods. To make the connection between life and death, sacrifice and 
nourishment, the artist always pairs this work with a bloody image titled 
"Striking worker, assassinated," from 1934; in the latter a teen-age boy lies 
dead in the street, a victim and martyr whose face is stained by a fountain of 
blood that flows from his wounds. There is a parallel between the flow of the 
water and the flow of the blood. The ancient martyrdom of Mayan males is 
equated with the image of a contemporary political martyr. Youth is not a safe 
time, Alvarez Bravo seems to say. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo's style is rooted both in Mexican history -- with its 
pre-Columbian and Spanish mix of religious and pagan symbols -- and in European 
art history, particularly surrealism. But, generally, he doesn't divide his 
focus in one direction or the other. Modern and ancient, mundane and sacred 
blend gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the iconography seems somewhat obvious, though it's never simple. 
"Coatlicue," 1987, pairs two sculptures in a bed of wild flowers. The first, a 
small pre-Columbian fertility sculpture of a woman, nestles the second, a folk 
art plaster skeleton in its arms. It is a pose that alludes to, and perhaps 
even mocks, the iconic Christian image of Mary holding the dead Christ in her 
arms. Alvarez Bravo's skeleton is like those commonly used on the Mexican Day 
of the Dead holy day to symbolize the return to earth of dead relatives. It is 
also just one of the many signs indicating Mexican culture's blending of 
Christian ritual and Mayan beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, though, Alvarez Bravo's meanings are tough to decipher. More often 
than not, hints of deeper meaning are suggested only cryptically through 
titles. And the titles can be poetic, but still illegible to those who don't 
know much about Mexican culture, which is why the explanatory wall texts 
provided are so important and helpful in this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Daughter of Dancers," for example, is a picture of a woman in traditional 
Mexican dress looking through a round window in a decorative brick wall; she 
stands in an odd posture, on her toes with one foot on top of the other. Perez 
explains that the title refers not only to dancers, but also to a kind of 
Mexican architectural carving, and that the woman is meant to be both an 
archetypal Mexican woman, and a reference to an indigenous Mexican art form. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not Alvarez Bravo's photographs are composed with a strong 
central image, so that the eye is drawn first to the abstract qualities of the 
compositions. He is a master at using light and dark passages to highlight his 
sense of mystery and draw out the sculptural qualities in his subjects. A 
portrait of Carlos Fuentes, for example, shows the figure's face half obscured 
by shadow. 
</P>
<P>
There are obvious debts in this work. For example, many of Alvarez Bravo's 
nudes where he shows just the female torso are clearly reminiscent of Edward 
Weston's work. And his experiments with X-rays represented by two images here 
owe much to the surrealist Man Ray. But despite such clear references, Alvarez 
Bravo adds his own flavor. His voluptuous subjects look like primitive 
fertility figures, not classical nudes, for example. His X-ray pictures are 
spiced with black humor. 
</P>
<P>
What remains surprising in a show spanning six decades of work is the 
consistency of the artist's interests and stylistic devices throughout. 
Happily, Alvarez Bravo's peculiar mix of patriotism and humor, mythology and 
life, has changed very little over the years. Alvarez Bravo knows how to 
provoke. And he knows how to please the eye. 
</P>
<P>
He's done both well for a very long time. After closing in San Diego, the 
exhibition travels on a two-year national tour to San Francisco, Detroit, 
Kansas City, Kan., Santa Barbara, Haverford, Pa., Coral Gables, Fla., and 
Cambridge, Mass.

The Rio Azul archeological project in Guatemala is considered one of the finest 
examples of early classic Mayan culture, encompassing the period from about AD 
250-600. "Rio Azul: City of the Storm God," highlighting discoveries from the 
excavation, will be at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County 
beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists began excavating the site in 1982, but found that many of the 
burial sites had been sacked by looters. Artifacts from unlooted sites, 
however, proved to be an invaluable source of new information about the Mayan 
people and will be on display. A highlight of the exhibit is a replica of a 
tomb re-creating the scene at the moment it was discovered by archeologists.

UNITED STATES' ROLE IN TERRORISM BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freed, referring to the 1954 overthrow of the government by the military, fails 
to mention that it was the CIA that overthrew this fledgling democracy. Its 
president, Jacobo Arbenz, was implementing desperately needed agrarian reform 
(something like 2% of the population own 70% of the land), and in 1954 that 
sounded too much like communism. 
</P>
<P>
This snuffing out of agrarian reform coupled with the continuing fight against 
so-called international communism has brought about the near-genocide of the 
Mayan people who comprise two-thirds of the Guatemalan population. The Mayans 
are inheritors of a rich civilization that goes back more than 3,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the military assumed power in 1954, they have brutally killed and 
massacred more than a 100,000 Indians who live in the Highlands where the 
insurgents make their camps; 440 Mayan villages have been destroyed while many 
others are in ruins without potable water; 50% of Mayan children die before 
they reach 5 years old; 150,000 refugees live in United Nations camps across 
the border. Disappearances continue, and death squads operate with impunity. 
Torture is practiced as a profession in the military. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should discontinue all military aid to Guatemala, which is conducting 
a war against its own indigenous people. In Guatemala, communism and drugs are 
not the enemy, poverty is.

FT  13 FEB 93 / A very slow bamboo boat from China . . .: Columbus? A mere
new boy in America, or so Tim Coone hears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WERE the first civilised discoverers of America Chinese mariners, ordered by
their emperor to cross the Pacific on bamboo rafts more than 2,000 years
ago?
This question, which has puzzled archaeologists and anthropologists for
decades, is to be put to a daring test by Tim Severin, the explorer and
travel writer. In May, he plans to sail eastwards on a flimsy raft similar
to that used by those Chinese sailors to show that they could have completed
the 6,000 mile voyage to America.
The idea that the ancient Chinese exported some of their developed culture
to the Americas is strongly supported by Professor Joseph Needham, the
eminent orientalist and historian.
Modern archaeological techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, have
established that the first real 'discoverers' of the continent, were Stone
Age hunter-gatherers from Asia who crossed the Bering Strait around 12,000
to 15,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, when sea-levels were
much lower than today.
These then dispersed throughout North and South America. As the world's
climate warmed and sea levels rose, contact was broken. There the agreement
on the cultural evolution of the AmerIndians ends.
Academic debate now centres around two antagonistic groups. The first,
dubbed the 'transoceanic culture diffusionists', claims that the many
similarities that have been observed between Asiatic and AmerIndian cultures
are the result of subsequent maritime contact between the two continents.
The second group, which believes in 'independent development' claims that
the similarities are coincidental, and the culture, science and technology
of the Americas developed independently . These achievements include the
highly accurate Mayan calendar and their pictographic scripts, impressive
stone temples demonstrating sophisticated geometric and engineering skills,
the cultivation of maize and cotton, and ornate metalworking of gold and
silver.
Severin's 'China Voyage' as it is to be called, will challenge the
'independent developmentalists' viewpoint. His voyage across the Pacific
ocean from Hong Kong to Mexico, will be aboard a specially built 60-foot
bamboo raft which is a replica of the sailing craft used by Chinese
fishermen and mariners 2000 years ago.
Taking the east-going Kuroshio current across the north Pacific, which was
used by the Spanish galleons in the 16th century, his aim is to follow the
probable route of an expedition of 3,000 Asian mariners of the Ch'in dynasty
in 218 BC, who are recorded as having been despatched by their emperor to
find a land across the ocean. There they believed a drug which would give
long life could be found. Severin believes they may have succeeded although
they never returned.
Severin, aged 52, is no novice to such expeditions. His Brendan Voyage in a
leather-hulled boat across the Atlantic in 1976, tracing the probable course
of an eighth century Irish monk, was followed by further voyages in replica
ancient boats; first in the Black Sea to trace the journey of Jason and the
Argonauts, in the Mediterranean following Ulysses' 'Odyssey', in the China
Sea after Sinbad the sailor, as well as two horseback treks - one following
a Crusade route and another through Mongolia on the trail of Genghis Khan.
The raft for the China Voyage has been designed by Colin Mudie, who worked
on three other replica craft for Severin's previous expeditions. It is being
built at Sam S'on on the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam, the only place in the
world says Severin, where such vessels are still in use.
A precursor of the later Chinese junks, the raft consists of three layers of
bamboo lashed together with rattan string and bamboo skin. Two small cabins,
which will be 'home' to the five-man crew for the six-month voyage, are made
of plaited bamboo strips sealed with a mixture of sawdust and tree lacquer.
It is powered by three Chinese battened lugsails set on bamboo masts and
steered by an arrangement of rudders and centreboards. When fully-laden, the
deck will be only a foot above sea-level.
The crafts's seaworthiness is based on a 'wash-through' principle, allowing
it to absorb the power of heavy seas by letting waves percolate through the
fabric of the hull. Severin says that prolonged exposure to the elements
will be a major problem for the five-man crew. Other perils they may have to
face are fog and typhoons. He said 'previous attempts to reconstruct voyages
in bamboo rafts have never gone so far without sinking, breaking up or being
eaten up by shipworm'.
However, Severin is no stranger to hardship. He braved storms, killer whales
and pack ice in the north Atlantic in a small leather-hulled curragh during
the Brendan voyage. He was surrounded by sharks and becalmed in the Doldrums
on his Sinbad voyage.
The China Voyage will have the benefit of modern navigational aids,
liferafts, radio, and warm clothing unlike the ancient Chinese mariners.
'Anything that will enhance safety will be aboard, but will only be used as
backups. We shall be eating similar foods to those used then and be using
replicas of early Chinese compasses and star-angle measuring devices to
navigate'.
So what drives this slightly-built Englishman who settled happily in a small
village in the west of Ireland 20 years ago, to continue undertaking such
risky expeditions?
He says: 'I enjoy doing them. It is as simple as that. It is an intellectual
challenge rather than a physical one. I hope this voyage, like the other
ones, will demonstrate that the technology existed then to enable travel
from one side of the ocean to the other'.
As with the Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki expeditions, and his own previous
adventures, Severin recognises that a successful conclusion of the China
voyage will not necessarily prove that maritime contact across the oceans
was achieved in pre-Christian times.
'What it will do is symbolise that various voyages could have taken place.
We are focussing on one that was recorded as having set off in the Annals of
China, although nothing was ever heard of them again.'
'What those mariners would have carried with them, are not so much
archaeological artefacts that would have survived through time but their
intellectual baggage - their knowledge of calendars and astronomy, their
writing and art, and their building skills. These could have been passed on
and survived if they reached their destination,' he said. Severin hopes to
make his own landfall in the New World in October.

<TEXT>
   The tiny Indian girl was beyond help.
Just three months old, she was blind, severely dehydrated and
stricken with pneumonia. The baby's illness, her mother said, began
with a compliment.
   ``It's a superstition here that if somebody tells you your baby
is pretty, something bad will happen to it,'' said Pamela Lear, a
nurse practitioner from Greenville, Ky., and a 1st lieutenant in the
Kentucky National Guard.
   The baby also was coated with dried herbs when her mother brought
her to the mountaintop clinic. A ``zahorin,'' or traditional healer,
had tried in the ancient Mayan way to ward off the spirits believed
to be afflicting the child.
   To Lear and Lt. Col. Paula Maionchi, a Richmond, Ky., physician,
it was obvious that something bad had surely happened. It was
equally obvious that it had nothing to do with compliments and
curses.
   It had to do with severe vitamin A deficiency, debilitating
diarrhea, intestinal parasites _ and the tragic decision of a young
mother in an isolated society to turn first to a medicine man for
help. Maionchi arranged the baby's transfer to a hospital two hours
away in Guatemala City. She died en route.
   It was the gravest illness that the 475th Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital and 973rd Dental Detachment would face this day in the
Sierra Madre where the guards spent part of a two-week training and
humanitarian-aid mission.
   In a larger sense, the child's illness was a severe example of
problems that are widespread in a Mayan population where infant
mortality is high, life expectancy is low and the time in between is
arduous. Half of Guatemala's 7.7 million residents are descendants
of the Mayans.
   Lear and Capt. Douglas Stevens, a Lexington, Ky., physician, were
seeing ailments they didn't encounter at home, including
tuberculosis in young people. Parasitic diseases were rampant,
malnutrition and bronchitis were common.
   Up to 80 percent of Mayan children die before their first
birthdays, said Col. Michael McConnell, chief surgeon of the U.S.
Army's Southern Command. The guards were seeing ``the ones that made
it through,'' said McConnell, who observed the training and
treatment here and at Choatulum and Chemachoy.
   At each site, the guards set up shop in a tiny clinic of a
standard government design _ three small examining rooms off a
compact waiting area. The clinics were equipped with cold water and
almost nothing else.
   The clinic in Xepatan was without heat or light. Capt. David
O'Banion, a Louisville dentist, and Sgt. Charisse Newton, a
Frankfort dental technician, extracted teeth by the light of
battery-powered head lamps.
   At Choatalum, the line of patients was long but Dr. Joseph Dobner
wasn't seeing unusual cases. The tiny, bullet-riddled building in
which he set up his clinic, however, was a far cry from his
Frankfort office. Part of the roof had been blown away and the
windows shattered. Electricity came from a generator ``so loud that
I can't listen to the lungs, ... so we tend not to use it.''
   ``I'm high-tech in a very low-tech situation,'' said Dobner, a
lieutenant colonel in the 475th MASH and an orthopedic surgeon.
   ``When you put any organization through a rigorous situation,
they're going to learn and it's going to forge them into a more
cohesive unit and they learn how to work with adversity. And boy,
we're working with adversity.''
   The Mayans also have suffered from Guatemala's 30-year-old civil
war. Government critics say the military engaged in a ``scorched
earth'' campaign to rid the countryside of rebels and their
potential supporters among Indians.
   National Guard units from Iowa and Georgia preceded Kentucky's
under an agreement with the Guatemalan government. Each exercise was
conducted with the army medical corps, Ministry of Health and the
Animal Health Agency.
   Like his colleagues, Dobner spent his time treating parasitic
infections, lung ailments and dispensing ointments and pain
relievers for countless aching joints and muscles that are the
legacy of life in the rugged Sierra Madre.
   ``I'm amazed at these people. You don't see much in the way of
major orthopedic problems because they're dead. They don't have a
chance. If they're at all infirm, they're gone,'' Dobner said.
   There is ``no training opportunity that even comes close to
this'' at home, said Maj. Allen Youngman, assistant chief of staff.
``This is an opportunity to do something right that maybe we haven't
done right in the past.''
   For Maj. Beverly Vance, an Eastern Kentucky University nursing
instructor, it was ``the most gratifying experience I've ever had.''
   ``It will make my unit better. Support of the operation is not
what it should be, but it never is,'' Dobner said. Because
pharmaceutical needs change with the seasons, the mission also
taught the Southern Command a few things.
   The unit was learning to do without medical supplies that were
either in short supply or were used up rapidly, he said. Everyone
seeking treatment at Choatalum had head lice, for example, and
anti-lice medicine was quickly gone.
   ``Three days into the exercise and we were out of something that
would make life lots better. But the last group down here (from the
Georgia Guard) didn't use what they had because it was a different
season,'' he said.
   The stoicism of the Mayans was underscored at Xepatan, where
O'Banion and Newton averaged about two extractions per patient _ the
only practical treatment, under the circumstances, for scores with
rotted teeth.
   One of the patients, a slightly built 27-year-old man, had a
badly abscessed tooth. He probably was seeing for the first time a
long needle like the one used to shoot anesthesia into his gums, but
he didn't flinch.
   ``They live with chronic pain. The needle is no big deal,''
O'Banion said.
   But the acidity of the man's infected gum tissue negated the
anesthetic and he soon was in obvious pain. He clenched the sides of
the examining table as O'Banion worked to extract a tooth that was
shattering with each touch.
   ``It's like trying to take a piece of glass out of concrete,'' he
said. ``You just have to be patient and work at it. ... He'll feel
noticeable improvement after a couple of hours.''
   His ordeal over, the patient eased himself off the table, plunked
a battered hat on his head and moved toward the door. There he
paused and gave a broad wave to O'Banion and Newton.
   O'Banion nodded in return.
   ``Another satisfied customer,'' he said.

   The tiny Indian girl was beyond help.
Just three months old, she was blind, severely dehydrated and
stricken with pneumonia. The baby's illness, her mother said, began
with a compliment.
   ``It's a superstition here that if somebody tells you your baby
is pretty, something bad will happen to it,'' said Pamela Lear, a
nurse practitioner from Greenville, Ky., and a 1st lieutenant in the
Kentucky National Guard.
   The baby also was coated with dried herbs when her mother brought
her to the mountaintop clinic. A ``zahorin,'' or traditional healer,
had tried in the ancient Mayan way to ward off the spirits believed
to be afflicting the child.
   To Lear and Lt. Col. Paula Maionchi, a Richmond, Ky., physician,
it was obvious that something bad had surely happened. It was
equally obvious that it had nothing to do with compliments and
curses.
   It had to do with severe vitamin A deficiency, debilitating
diarrhea, intestinal parasites _ and the tragic decision of a young
mother in an isolated society to turn first to a medicine man for
help. Maionchi arranged the baby's transfer to a hospital two hours
away in Guatemala City. She died en route.
   It was the gravest illness that the 475th Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital and 973rd Dental Detachment would face this day in the
Sierra Madre where the guards spent part of a two-week training and
humanitarian-aid mission.
   In a larger sense, the child's illness was a severe example of
problems that are widespread in a Mayan population where infant
mortality is high, life expectancy is low and the time in between is
arduous. Half of Guatemala's 7.7 million residents are descendants
of the Mayans.
   Lear and Capt. Douglas Stevens, a Lexington, Ky., physician, were
seeing ailments they didn't encounter at home, including
tuberculosis in young people. Parasitic diseases were rampant,
malnutrition and bronchitis were common.
   Up to 80 percent of Mayan children die before their first
birthdays, said Col. Michael McConnell, chief surgeon of the U.S.
Army's Southern Command. The guards were seeing ``the ones that made
it through,'' said McConnell, who observed the training and
treatment here and at Choatulum and Chemachoy.
   At each site, the guards set up shop in a tiny clinic of a
standard government design _ three small examining rooms off a
compact waiting area. The clinics were equipped with cold water and
almost nothing else.
   The clinic in Xepatan was without heat or light. Capt. David
O'Banion, a Louisville dentist, and Sgt. Charisse Newton, a
Frankfort dental technician, extracted teeth by the light of
battery-powered head lamps.
   At Choatalum, the line of patients was long but Dr. Joseph Dobner
wasn't seeing unusual cases. The tiny, bullet-riddled building in
which he set up his clinic, however, was a far cry from his
Frankfort office. Part of the roof had been blown away and the
windows shattered. Electricity came from a generator ``so loud that
I can't listen to the lungs, ... so we tend not to use it.''
   ``I'm high-tech in a very low-tech situation,'' said Dobner, a
lieutenant colonel in the 475th MASH and an orthopedic surgeon.
   ``When you put any organization through a rigorous situation,
they're going to learn and it's going to forge them into a more
cohesive unit and they learn how to work with adversity. And boy,
we're working with adversity.''
   The Mayans also have suffered from Guatemala's 30-year-old civil
war. Government critics say the military engaged in a ``scorched
earth'' campaign to rid the countryside of rebels and their
potential supporters among Indians.
   National Guard units from Iowa and Georgia preceded Kentucky's
under an agreement with the Guatemalan government. Each exercise was
conducted with the army medical corps, Ministry of Health and the
Animal Health Agency.
   Like his colleagues, Dobner spent his time treating parasitic
infections, lung ailments and dispensing ointments and pain
relievers for countless aching joints and muscles that are the
legacy of life in the rugged Sierra Madre.
   ``I'm amazed at these people. You don't see much in the way of
major orthopedic problems because they're dead. They don't have a
chance. If they're at all infirm, they're gone,'' Dobner said.
   There is ``no training opportunity that even comes close to
this'' at home, said Maj. Allen Youngman, assistant chief of staff.
``This is an opportunity to do something right that maybe we haven't
done right in the past.''
   For Maj. Beverly Vance, an Eastern Kentucky University nursing
instructor, it was ``the most gratifying experience I've ever had.''
   ``It will make my unit better. Support of the operation is not
what it should be, but it never is,'' Dobner said. Because
pharmaceutical needs change with the seasons, the mission also
taught the Southern Command a few things.
   The unit was learning to do without medical supplies that were
either in short supply or were used up rapidly, he said. Everyone
seeking treatment at Choatalum had head lice, for example, and
anti-lice medicine was quickly gone.
   ``Three days into the exercise and we were out of something that
would make life lots better. But the last group down here (from the
Georgia Guard) didn't use what they had because it was a different
season,'' he said.
   The stoicism of the Mayans was underscored at Xepatan, where
O'Banion and Newton averaged about two extractions per patient _ the
only practical treatment, under the circumstances, for scores with
rotted teeth.
   One of the patients, a slightly built 27-year-old man, had a
badly abscessed tooth. He probably was seeing for the first time a
long needle like the one used to shoot anesthesia into his gums, but
he didn't flinch.
   ``They live with chronic pain. The needle is no big deal,''
O'Banion said.
   But the acidity of the man's infected gum tissue negated the
anesthetic and he soon was in obvious pain. He clenched the sides of
the examining table as O'Banion worked to extract a tooth that was
shattering with each touch.
   ``It's like trying to take a piece of glass out of concrete,'' he
said. ``You just have to be patient and work at it. ... He'll feel
noticeable improvement after a couple of hours.''
   His ordeal over, the patient eased himself off the table, plunked
a battered hat on his head and moved toward the door. There he
paused and gave a broad wave to O'Banion and Newton.
   O'Banion nodded in return.
   ``Another satisfied customer,'' he said.

   A museum in southeastern Mexico offers clues to
three civilizations that predate the Aztecs. Among other things,
there is evidence that these ancient people probably perceived the
earth as round, designed remarkably accurate calendars and had an
advanced knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.

   Huge carved stone heads, tiny clay figures
and thousands of other artifacts at a museum here tell a strange
story about three civilizations that flourished long before
Columbus discovered America.
   It's about the Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecs, who inhabited a
long stretch of coast on the Gulf of Mexico.
   The fascinating and sometimes gruesome story is told vividly at
the Museum of Xalapa, which specializes in the region's
archaeological treasures.
   A lot is still unknown about the three civilizations. They are
believed to have been part of a series of migrations from Asia that
started about 35,000 years ago across the Bering Strait, by way of
Alaska, and lasted several millenia.
   But, says museum director Fernando Winfield Capitaine, ``as new
finds are made and studies of old ones shed new light, the results
may rewrite quite a few history books.
   ``We don't know what their language was, or what they even
called themselves,'' he adds. ``Even the names we use for them are
false and relatively new. They are `nahuatl' names, the trading
language of the Aztecs, which didn't even exist at the time.''
   Only 3,000 of the museum's 29,000 pieces are on display for lack
of space. They tell how these people performed human sacrifices,
probably perceived the earth as round, designed remarkably accurate
calendars and had an advanced knowledge of mathemathics and
astronomy, among other things.
   The artifacts range in size from a tiny Olmec carving of a rain
god 4 inches high, to huge stone altars. The museum's centerpiece
is a monolithic head 9 feet high and weighing 16 tons, carved from
andesite rock.
   Now housed in a new $3 million set of modern buildings covering
14,400 square yards and surrounded by eight acres of wooded park,
the museum is part of the Veracruz state university in Xalapa, the
state's capital 74 miles northwest of the port of Veracruz.
   The Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecas based their agriculture on
corn, frijole beans and squash, supplementing their diets with dog
meat, river fish and wild animals and birds, which they seasoned
with chili peppers, herbs and other spices.
   Both their weapons and their tools were crude, mostly made out
of stone or wood, and no one is sure how they carved such huge
stone statues. But their civilizations were surprisingly advanced
for its time.
   In his guidebook ``Master Works of the Xalapa Museum,'' Mexican
anthropolgist Alfonso Medellin Zenil says it's possible the Olmecs
were the first to make paper out of wood pulp in America.
   Archaeologists believe the political organization was more of a
loose coalition of small towns or city-states than one big
government entity. But their influence spread far and wide and some
of it survives in present-day Mexico.
   They could read and write and knew what a wheel was, but didn't
use it, probably because they had no draft animals. Their ancestors
had hunted them all out of existence, including the ancient
American horse and the elephant.
   They spun and wove fibers, including cotton. They tailored their
clothes, wore earrings and jewelry, blackened their teeth with
natural tar for cosmetic purposes and made rubber from the rubber
tree, which is native to the region.
   Being cross-eyed was considered a sign of beauty.
   By polishing metallic rock, the Olmecs made flat mirrors which
they hung over their chests as jewelry, or concave ones, which they
used to light fires.
   They made music on drums, whistles, ocarinas, clay flutes and
other instruments. They traveled and traded extensively, as far
west as the Pacific Coast and as far south as El Salvador in
Central America, spreading their cultures and acquiring new ones.
   As a result, cacao _ the bean from which chocolate is derived
and is native to the Gulf Coast _ became a popular currency for
trade throughout pre-Columbian Mexico.
   At first, they cremated or simply buried their dead, but later
they built little pyramidal rock mounds to mark the sites. Later
still, they built the monumental pyramids that survive today.
   They played a ceremonial sport with a rubber ball, which was a
combination of soccer and basketball. The winning team was
afterwards beheaded as a sacrifice, usually to a sun god, although
some authorities claim it was the losers who lost their heads.
   Other victims had their hearts cut out atop some pyramid or
other sacred altar. Some were skinned alive and priests donned
their skins to dance before Xipe Totec, the ``god of the flayed,''
in a fertility rite to mark the beginning of spring.
   Prisoners of war often had their hands severed so the victors
could acquire their strength, skill and magic.
   Worship was centered on the sun, the moon and the planet Venus.
   All three cultures worshipped the jaguar as a sun god and
hunting the animal was forbidden, except for its skins, which
priests wore during sacred ceremonies. The jaguar was often
depicted in partly human form.
   It was said that in times long past a woman mated with a jaguar,
giving birth to a ``were-jaguar.'' Archeologists believe this
explains the Olmecs' morbid fascination with dwarfs, hunchbacks and
other human deformations.
   Little is known about Venus, usually depicted as the lesser of
the three, except that Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl, god of the hurricane
and other winds, and Xochiquetzal, goddess of love and the spring,
were probably associated with it.
   The most fascinating of the moon deities was Tlasolteotl, the
Totonaca goddess of confession, protectress of childbirth and
advocate of illicit love and passions. She encouraged people to sin
so that she could later absolve them.
   Sinners had to confess to her, so that she could devour the
``rubbish or spiritual garbage'' that weighed upon them.
   ``But,'' says Winfield, ``only one confession was allowed in a
lifetime, and people tried to put it off as much as they could,
since there was no forgiveness for a second offender.''

Six-year-old Carlitos arrived on time for his first day of primary school in 
San Juan, Comalapa, a small town 50 miles northwest of Guatemala City. But 
despite his desire to learn and the full attention he gave his teacher, he 
couldn't understand a word that was said. The instructor spoke only Spanish and 
Carlitos spoke only Kaqchikel. The teaching method was repetition, not 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
Carlitos, who is now 22 and an economist, remembers that "it was like being in 
a box without an escape." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of his classmates had to repeat first grade. Many took two or 
three years to pass each grade until they reached sixth. Many more gave up. 
Although Guatemala is not the poorest nation in Latin America, it is the second 
most illiterate (Haiti is first) and has the second-highest dropout rate. Less 
than 10% of those who enter first grade graduate from sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"The school itself is the source of illiteracy; it is a center of failure, not 
a center of learning," said Mario Leyton, an education consultant sponsored by 
the United Nations Development Program and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization. "It is the scene of a confrontation of cultures." 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan educational system is going through a radical change with the 
support of the almost 3-year-old democratic government of President Vinicio 
Cerezo. The curriculum from preschool to sixth grade is being transformed to 
respond to the needs of the long-neglected Mayan majority of the population. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan Indians, more than half of whom do not speak Spanish, are further 
distinguished from the mestizos (mixed Spanish descent) by their darker skin, 
their practice of Mayan religion as well as Roman Catholicism and their 
brightly embroidered, traditional clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than promoting the current cultural confrontation and attempting to 
integrate Mayan children into a dominant Western culture, the new curriculum 
will integrate all children into a Guatemalan nationality that is 
pluri-cultural and respects diversity," Leyton said. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are 23 languages and cultures within Guatemala and further 
diversity throughout the various regions, teachers in each school will have the 
freedom to design a curriculum that responds to the needs of their particular 
community. 
</P>
<P>
For example, students in one region may learn mathematics in terms of 
coffee-growing, the occupation most prevalent in the children's families. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious project began with $200,000 in seed money from United Nations 
Development Program, the financial motivator for further donations, including 
$1.6 million from the Netherlands, $600,000 from the World Bank and $180,000 
from the United States Agency for International Development, in addition to $1 
million from the Guatemalan government. 
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, teachers from all over the country will have 
participated in the formation of basic but flexible curriculum guides for each 
grade; they will know the language of the students and gradually introduce 
Spanish as a second language while using the native language for instruction in 
the first grade; more participation and practical activities will replace rote 
learning; more visual aids will be used, and the entire process will reflect 
individual community needs, such as classes being held in non-harvest seasons 
when children are not required to work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons that parents do not keep their children in school. Some 
Mayans see learning Spanish as surrendering to the Spanish conquerors. Others 
lose patience after children repeat the same grade several times. The 
repetition of grades also means a first-grade classroom has students from ages 
6 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
By reducing repetition, the project will make room for more students without 
the need for building new classrooms. At present, the average Guatemalan 
between the ages of 6 and 12 has 2.5 years of schooling; the project hopes to 
raise that to 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Success will guarantee economic, social and cultural development of all 
sectors and will thus strengthen the democratic process," Leyton said.

As interesting and informative as was Weisman's article on Arthur Demarest's 
excavations of the Mayan civilization, one could wish for less hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
We may have underestimated the glories of native American peoples, but let us 
not now be guilty of this kind of exaggeration: "Their monumental architecture, 
as well as their painting, astronomy, mathematics and literature, humbled the 
achievements of their contemporaries in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that most of us are unaware of how impressive were the Mayan 
accomplishments in these areas, the statement is patently false in all areas 
except possibly astronomy. There is nothing among the Mayan ruins to indicate 
an architecture that equaled the accomplishments of Imperial Rome. Nor do the 
remains of Mayan paintings equal the combined accomplishments of Egypt, Greece, 
Rome and the Byzantine world as we know them. As for literature, get serious! I 
trust this wild hypothesizing originates with your author and not with 
professor Demarest.

The Indiana Jane of Landscape Photography
---
By Robert Goldberg</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   One morning late last week I found myself 1,000 feet in the air, bouncing around in a rickety old single-engine plane. 
The engine droned half-heartedly, the chassis jolted up and down, and we barely skimmed the tops of the apartment buildings along the Hudson River. 
As the nose took an alarming dive for the third time, I clutched my seat belt and tried to remember why in the world I was there. 

   "Goldberg," the voice had rasped out of my answering machine. 
"I want you to go up in an airplane with a beautiful woman photographer. 
She flies around in one of those tiny propeller planes." 
The voice chuckled. 
"It shouldn't be too dangerous." 

   So there I was, gritting my teeth and looking a little green. 
The pilot turned around and smiled. 
"You're not going to get sick, are you?" he asked, thrusting a small blue bag into my hands. 
I smiled back wanly and concentrated on taking notes. 

   "Look over there," Marilyn Bridges yelled back, her beach-blond hair whipping in the wind. 
The horizon tipped up at us alarmingly. 
Ms. Bridges jammed her Pentax medium format camera into her face, and started snapping furiously out the open window. 

   For the past eight years, Marilyn Bridges has been hanging out of open airplane doors and windows, suspending herself over space, shooting landscapes from above. 
Like some combination of Ansel Adams and Indiana Jones -- artist and adventurer -- the coltishly attractive young photographer has been drawn to ancient, sacred sites: ceremonial pyramids of the Mayans in Mexico, stone circles of the Druids in Britain, the huge ground drawings in Peru known as the Nazca lines. 

   Her shadowed, textured aerial landscapes have won her Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Arts grants, and been collected by the Bibliotheque Nationale, the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center of Photography. 
Her show, "Markings," is currently on view at New York's Burden Gallery through May 2. (It then travels to the Oklahoma Art Center in Oklahoma City June 4-Aug. 13 and the Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, Fla., Sept. 18-Oct. 25. 
Subsequent shows are planned for Arizona, Ohio and California.) 

   "I'm trying to show something people never get to see," Ms. Bridges says, "the world from God's-eye view. 
I'm above, but not that high above -- about 500 to 1,000 feet. 
I'm actually very intimate with the scene, hovering around on top of the trees." 

   While Ms. Bridges is, by definition, a landscape photographer, she draws a distinction between herself and her earth-bound counterparts. 
"In a plane, it's not like doing landscapes on the ground. 
You're moving so fast, you can't get absorbed, or take your time. 
You have to shoot fast. 
It's like Cartier-Bresson -- catching the 'decisive moment.'" 

   Ms. Bridges has photographed all over the world -- from Greece to the Yucatan -- but wherever she is, she keeps returning to ruined temples and line drawings scraped into the earth. 
She documents these ancient, ritualistic sites, these strange mixtures of art and religion, often produced as offerings to the gods and visible only from the sky. 
In one sense then, Ms. Bridges's photos have an almost anthropological purpose. 
She sometimes calls herself a "visual archaeologist." 
Yet the photographer is equally adamant about the emotional component of her work, about "trying to make an artistic statement beyond just a historic document -- to evoke the spirit of the place." 

   Shot in black and white, her pictures are marked by a melancholy that hangs over the scene, a kind of mournful emptiness. 
"There is an isolation, a longing in my images," says Ms. Bridges. 
"It's almost sad, looking at the ancient ritual sites and not seeing ancient man there." 

   Thirty-eight-year-old Ms. Bridges has been taking pictures since the age of five, when she got a Brownie camera for Christmas. 
Her father was a photo enthusiast, and, she remembers, "I was always being photographed." 
In 1967, at the age of 18, Ms. Bridges left her "sheltered" home in New Jersey and went off to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury for the Summer of Love. 
In her teens and early 20s, she worked as a model. 

   "Actually," she recalls, "I kept wanting to get behind the camera, to go in the darkroom and watch the magic of the images coming up." 
Ms. Bridges first earned money with a camera as a travel photographer for airline magazines and women's journals. 
After a few years, however, she left magazine work to become an art photographer, and went back to get an MFA at R.I.T. 

   It was while photographing the Nazca lines in Peru in 1979 that Ms. Bridges first became fascinated with aerial photography. 
It still remains her favorite mode. 
"I like the adventure, that aspect of danger," she says, her blue eyes opening wide. 

   Turning to look out the open window of the plane, Ms. Bridges asks, "You hear that buzzer?" 
I did. 
"That's the stall buzzer -- it means the plane is close to stalling. 
We have to fly very slowly when I photograph." 
But surely, I said, you can restart a plane when it stalls out? 
"You can," she nodded, "But not when you're this low. 
There's no space to put the nose down and get the air speed up. 
You dive right into the ground." 
So what about that stall buzzer? 
I asked nervously. 
"That's the edge," she said with a little grin. 
"There's always that question -- are we going to make it this time? 
It makes me feel alive." 
It made me feel queasy. 

   Quickly changing the topic, I was glad to hear that Ms. Bridges had a second, more wholesome reason for preferring this kind of photography. 
"I love the outdoors, the earth," she said. 
"Actually, I'm a Capricorn, the earth sign. 
I love to mountain climb, to touch the earth. 
That's why I can relate to the philosophies of the Indians, their love for sacred landscapes." 

   An outdoors person, Ms. Bridges believes that "the big problem with us today is that we confine ourselves to small offices, we eat food out of tin cans, we watch TV in little living rooms. 
Man is separated from who he is, from the earth. 
We have such big egos; we think man was so primitive 2,000 years ago. 
But we've lost the things he had. 
He appreciated light and sun -- that was life. 
Today we sit in little rooms with fluorescent lights. 
It drives me crazy. 
How advanced are we?" 

   As her "Markings" show travels the U.S., Ms. Bridges has a second exhibit, "Greece: Sacred Sanctuaries/Secular Views" currently at the International Museum of Photography in Rochester, N.Y., through June 7, and is also working to raise funds for a photo show of North American Indian sacred sites. ("We always think of the pyramids of Egypt or the Yucatan -- but there's so much ancient history here in the U.S. that we've ignored -- that we're losing.") 
She's also trying to find ways to photograph in China and Saudi Arabia. 

   As the plane coasted in, and rolled to a stop at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport, Marilyn Bridges packed her camera away. 
Another good morning's work. 
And me, I wobbled out clutching the little blue airsickness bag. 
The bag, I'm proud to say, was unopened.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Saddam's unseen victims - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIEWPOINT 93; Saddam's Killing Fields (Tuesday, ITV) was a poignant reminder
that what the lens does not see the heart does not grieve over. It showed
how different have been the experiences of two groups of Saddam Hussein's
opponents, the Kurds and the Shia of southern Iraq.
The luck of the Kurds began to turn when the cameras focused on the poison
gas victims in the streets of Halabja. The cameras were back in force to
film the Kurds' exodus to the mountains, stumbling through the mud and snow.
Those pictures struck a chord in the outside world; emotion was translated
into action and the Kurds - at least in the short term - are safe.
The documentary, filmed in Free Kurdistan and Iran but not Iraq, pieced
together evidence of the scale and viciousness of the Iraqi army's
reprisals, said by the Kurds to have claimed 300,000 Shi-ite victims in the
intifida 1991 alone. The colossal bad luck of the Shias is that since the
crushing of their intifada, they have been hidden from the world's sight.
The programme examined the genocidal Iraqi policy towards the Marsh Arabs
and argued that the idea of a safe haven in the south must be resurrected.
The Marsh Arabs, said to number 70,000, face the extinction of their unique
way of life as their villages are rocketed, the waterways are poisoned, and
the buffaloes, fish and reed-beds die. The chief external witness to the
Marsh Arabs' destruction have been satellite photographs of land which is
now brown and lifeless, the effect of Iraq's notorious drainage project. It
was presented to the UN as an agricultural improvement scheme, but human
rights observers are convinced it is an instrument of genocide.
An amateur video made six months ago showed Marsh Arabs appealing to the UN
and US for help, above all for the canals to be bombed so that the water
returns. The hopelessness of these people was eloquently expressed by the
bitter words of one refugee: 'They come to film us and set us to music like
the TV comedy they think we are.'
The UK's foreign Office minister Douglas Hogg explained with wondrous
suavity that there was no possibility of external intervention although
''the process' will probably take some time. It is at least possible that
within the time-frame Saddam may fall.' To hear genocide described as 'a
process' gave a small chill. My mind jumped back to last Wednesday and the
first part of Thatcher: The Downing Street Years (BBC2), in which that lady
lambasted the Foreign Office and its 'whole culture' based on negotiation.
The Thatcher documentary is guinea-a-minute stuff. With the second
instalment screened tonight and such reams of comment already written, I
will not dwell on episode one except to say that the gender aspect was
particularly interesting. During her time in office Lady Thatcher showed
little interest in women's causes. Accepting membership of the single-sex
Carlton Club was just one example of her lack of solidarity. Even so, I
thought Lady Thatcher's observations about the prejudice she encountered for
being 'that woman' was telling.
Mrs Thatcher used sex as a weapon in her rise, but it also helped others to
belittle her and it played a part in her downfall. There is meat there for
every woman who operates in a male environment, however hostile she is to
Thatcher's political values, to ponder.
The Foreign Office came in for a pounding in Dispatches (Wednesday, C4), a
gripping dramatisation of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms for
Iraq scandal. The programme had actors impersonating figures such as David
Gore-Booth and William Waldegrave at the most uncomfortable moments of their
grilling by Scott and Presilly Baxendale. It made compulsive watching and
whetted the appetite for what is to come when Lady Thatcher and the Prime
Minister appear.
At some time I have been asked (possibly by my credit card company) for my
mother's maiden name as a way of ascertaining my credentials over the
telephone. Panorama; Secrets for Sale (BBC1, Monday) showed that no
question, however arcane (dog's name, favourite pudding), could protect
personal data.
Panorama filmed a ferrety character called Robert Hemphill using a lens
concealed in a rolled umbrella. His company is one of many which offer to
obtain details of bank accounts, credit cards, police records, National
Insurance and National Health records. Panorama set Hemphill to penetrate
the private details of four people, among them trade union secretary Rodney
Bickerstaff and Lord Parkinson's former lover, Sarah Keays.
The four were amazed to discover the speed with which secret information
could be produced. Hemphill, unaware of the umbrella lens, explained that he
could gain access to the police computer at Hendon which holds criminal
records. He told his Panorama contact: 'It's literally bribing a police
contact; it is that simple'
The scam revealed, Hemphill high-tailed out of the office pursued by his
Panorama interviewer. Some aspects of this kind of intelligence gathering
come close to criminality, but many are beyond the reach of the Data
Protection Act or any other legislation. Is the open society in one respect
effectively already here?
What a relief to turn to more rarified matters: the fate of vanished
civilisations, examined on Equinox; Out of the Past (C4, Sunday). Who could
envy the modern archaeologists after a programme in which we saw them
spending years counting pine seeds and measuring microscopic variations in
the cutting edge of obsidian knives? The end result, however, is an
important jolt to the old chronology of the collapse of Mayan civilisation
in Central America.
It now seems that the Mayans did not suddenly vanish. Their kings departed
but the ordinary folk carried on, planting their maize for two centuries.
But when the end came, in the 12th century AD, it was over-population,
salination, and soil exhaustion which put paid to a brilliant, cruel
civilisation.
The moral is one that archaeology is increasingly coming to realise. Pace
New Age romantics, many an ancient peasant civilisation did not live in
joyous harmony with its environment. This was a brilliant documentary,
untricksy, even old-fashioned, and there was no presenter but only bearded
archaeologists with a far away look in their eyes. Yet for sheer cerebral
excitement, it was quite the best thing I have seen in a long month supine
in front of the TV.

VOLCANO LOCKED MAYAN SETTLEMENT IN A TIME CAPSULE; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: FOR EXCITED INVESTIGATORS, THE 1,400-YEAR-OLD CIVILIZATION IS A 
POMPEII IN EL SALVADOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a June evening 1,400 years ago, a volcano suddenly erupted in what is now El 
Salvador and sealed an entire prehistoric settlement in a time capsule, 
complete with the dirty dishes of a civilization that flourished 600 years 
before Columbus arrived in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
Buried beneath 15 feet of volcanic ash and extensively excavated for the first 
time last summer, the houses of the village of El Ceren are preserved in such 
exceptional condition that archeologists say the dwellings and their contents 
are as nearly intact as Pompeii, the Greco-Roman city buried by the eruption of 
Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. 
</P>
<P>
"No other site in the New World has domestic architecture so well preserved," 
said Paul Amaroli, an archeologist at Vanderbilt University who has visited El 
Ceren. "It's hard to wear out superlatives on this site." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement over El Ceren stems from the fact that although monumental 
architecture such as Mayan temples and Aztec tombs are abundant in the area, 
well-preserved households of the peasants and commoners who built the 
ceremonial cities and carried out commerce and farming are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Even more precious are dwellings that have been preserved with the clutter of 
everyday life -- the garden tools, the pots and jars, even the dead ducks in 
the courtyard -- found in the same locations as they were that day 1,400 years 
ago when the volcano exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"They lived better than we had pictured them," said Payson Sheets, an 
archeologist from the University of Colorado in Boulder who is leading the 
excavation of El Ceren. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize now that their domestic adobe architecture was much more 
sophisticated than we thought. The structures sit on big, fired platforms. 
They'd be dry even during the rainy season. The roofs were substantial. These 
were not people living crowded and huddled in a mud hut. Even their poorest 
houses were better than much of the rural houses in El Salvador today. They 
really seemed to be fairly well off." 
</P>
<P>
In El Ceren, ceramic pots were found tucked into adobe niches where they were 
placed by the occupants. A digging stick leans against a doorway. A wooden 
pestle rests in a stone mortar. Enigmatic graffiti are still visible in one 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Two metates, the flat stones used for grinding flour, were discovered still 
resting on the forked wooden posts that supported them in use. Sharp obsidian 
knives, some with food residue still clinging to the blades, are wedged into 
the thatched roof, placed as if to be safely out of reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
And what may turn out to be the only book, or codex, as archeologists call 
them, to survive was found in a small cubbyhole beside three painted pots and 
an oyster shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Other codices survive from Mesoamerica, but they were all squirreled away 
someplace, hidden, and then ended up in collections. None of the codices are 
attached to a context. We don't know where they're from or who used them. . . . 
Here we have a book from an agricultural setting," said Harriet Beaubien, an 
expert in the conservation of antiquities at the Smithsonian Institution who is 
trying to preserve the painted codex found in a block of ash at El Ceren. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan settlement of El Ceren was inadvertently uncovered by a bulldozer 
helping to construct grain storage silos in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets was in El Salvador, working at another site, and heard about the 
discovery of "recent houses" found under 15 feet of volcanic ash. Sheets said 
he expected the houses to be a hundred years old at the most. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought a trowel and went looking for Coke bottles, pieces of tin, plastic 
wrappers -- something that would date the structures," Sheets said. "Instead, I 
found a prehistoric pot. Well, I thought, these people must have had an 
interest in prehistory. I still didn't know what I was dealing with. Then I 
started finding more pots and I took some thatch samples for radiocarbon 
dating." 
</P>
<P>
Radiocarbon analysis of the thatch dated the structure about AD 600. Sheets was 
immediately intrigued, but even though he received funding from the National 
Science Foundation to begin excavating the site, he said he did not think it 
was safe to bring colleagues and students to El Salvador, which was then in the 
midst of a civil war. Sheets did not return to work in El Salvador until last 
summer, when the first extensive excavations were begun. 
</P>
<P>
El Ceren was buried when a vein of basaltic magma from the nearby Laguna 
Caldera Volcano came into contact with water from Rio Sucio. The combination of 
super-hot magma and water created steam explosions that blasted clouds of hot 
steam and ash toward El Ceren, a village of still unknown size. The rain of hot 
ash sealed the village within a volcanic cast. 
</P>
<P>
To date, three extended households have been excavated, along with outbuildings 
and storerooms. Nearby were furrowed fields with rows of short, young corn 
stalks along each little ridge, leading Sheets to guess that the volcano 
erupted in June. The fact that objects like digging sticks and cooking pots 
were put away makes Sheets suspect that the eruption occurred at night. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Miller, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano 
Observatory who has studied the site, said he thinks there were several 
eruptions and ground shaking caused by volcanic earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the eruptions began, it would be hard to get away. With the fall of ash, 
it would be pitch black. The hot surges would be very lethal. The temperatures 
of the clouds would at least be boiling," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"There'd be hot, moist ash with larger chunks of rock sailing along or falling 
out of the sky. People would be scalded, their lungs would burn and they'd 
probably die of asphyxiation." 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, and with some disappointment, Sheets said that no human remains have 
been found in El Ceren. Residents who watched the bulldozer find the first 
household report seeing human bones and described shapes that might have been 
body casts. 
</P>
<P>
They have disappeared. Sheets expects further digging to reveal remains in one 
of the several structures still not fully excavated, or in a household yet to 
be found.
