   Treasures even greater than those in King
Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said Zahi Hawass, director
of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient
cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's
buried. After all, Egypt is 97 percent desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut _ was found almost
intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist Howard Carter.
   It took Carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern Egypt's Valley of the
Kings.
   But Tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient Egypt's great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of Pharaoh Cheops, whose pyramid on Giza
Plateau is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at Sakkara, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the New
Kingdom, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C. Records say he wanted to be
buried in Egypt's Siwa Oasis, near Libya, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in Alexandria, the Mediterranean city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to Siwa to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said Sayed
Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As Egypt's population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in Egypt generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director Hawass said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September.
   In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of Luxor Temple. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is Giza Plateau's East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
Cheops pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
Hawass said.
   ``In Sakkara, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, Hawass said. These caches, which may explain the
Luxor Temple statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh Cheops, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is Cheops' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' Hawass said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after Cheops) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the Luxor find the Cheops discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of Cheops' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in Alexandria.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but Alexandria has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

Some chant. Some meditate. Some dance. Some sit in the lotus position and hum. 
</P>
<P>
Every year hundreds of devotees of the occult travel to Giza Plateau near Cairo 
to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped inside the pyramids of the Pharaohs 
Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus. 
</P>
<P>
Pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills, give glimpses into the future, 
provide a better night's sleep, even halt aging -- all for the price of 
admission, three Egyptian pounds ($1.20). 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Under new rules, pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more -- a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawass, Giza Plateau's director general, said groups of up to 15 now are 
allowed "to meditate or seek extrasensory powers" in the pyramids for 1,000 
Egyptian pounds ($400) and only outside normal tourist hours. Each extra 
participant pays 50 pounds ($20). 
</P>
<P>
Hawass said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to conduct seances 
inside the pyramids. Most want either to spend the night inside or to enter at 
the first rays of dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S. and elsewhere you have a lot of people with problems, and these 
people are seeking solutions. They look to the supernatural, and they think of 
the pyramids," Hawass said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we can't let these groups interfere with tourists wanting to look at the 
pyramids from a historical or architectural standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Hawass said the most active pyramid-visiting mystical groups in the United 
States are several from Santa Barbara, Calif., and from the Edgar Cayce 
Foundation of Virginia Beach, Va., named after the American psychic who died in 
1945. Cayce taught that the secrets of Atlantis and knowledge of the future are 
buried under the right front paw of the Sphinx at the foot of Giza Plateau. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Americans, theme cruises are organized in Europe and growing 
numbers of Japanese tours come to Giza especially to "tap pyramid power," 
Hawass said. 
</P>
<P>
"This pyramid power stuff is really big," he said. "People want to believe in 
magic, and big structures give an air of magic. I'm sure if I called myself the 
Pyramid Prophet I could have a following larger than the most famous Indian 
guru." 
</P>
<P>
Built about 4,600 years ago, the pyramids remain enigmas to scientists as well 
as to seekers of the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The first person to enter the Great Pyramid of Cheops in post-Pharaonic times 
was the caliph of Baghdad, Abdullah al-Ma'mun, in AD 820. He forced his way in 
by heating rocks, then breaking them by pouring on vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
As generations of scientists and tourists, eccentrics and treasure hunters 
followed him, pyramid mystique grew over the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the occult was 
Napoleon Bonaparte, who spent the night of Aug. 12, 1799, inside Cheops' 
pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken. 
</P>
<P>
He went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"No! What's the use," Napoleon was said to have told a friend. "You wouldn't 
believe me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Hawass said many people, especially in the United States, have ideas and 
theories about the Giza pyramids, particularly Cheops' Great Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
"They read that Cheops is made of 2.3 million blocks, each one weighing 2 1/2 
tons to 15 tons, each side at an angle of 51 degrees, 50 minutes and 35 
seconds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They think nobody on Earth could have built this. That the pyramids were built 
by people from outer space, or survivors from the lost continent of Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
"They never look at what's attached to the pyramids, the structures, the 
organization necessary to build them, the cult of the king." 
</P>
<P>
He said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been published in the 
United States, "but fewer than half a dozen contain any science of value." 
</P>
<P>
Hawass, who has a doctorate in Egyptology from the University of Pennsylvania 
and has lectured throughout North America about the pyramids, said he had never 
heard of pyramid power until he went there in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speaking to an audience in Hartford, Conn., and as I began to talk 
everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his head. I asked, 'What are you 
doing?' and they explained about power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
"OK. I try to be open-minded. When I returned, I tried some experiments." 
</P>
<P>
The first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought some meat and put part of it in my office, part inside Cheops. The 
meat inside my office lasted longer than inside the pyramid. That was one 
(myth) down.

<TEXT>
   An ancient mummy of an aristocratic
young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in a plaster death mask, has
been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of
Cheops.
   ``She's really lovely,'' said Aly Hassan, director of pharaonic
monuments for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. Hassan dated
the mummy as 4,400 years old, one of the earliest ever found in
Egypt.
   Egyptologists expressed surprise at Thursday's discovery, noting
the Giza pyramids area has been looted repeatedly since antiquity
and excavated by some of the greatest archaeologists of the last two
centuries.
   Hassan said the seals of the grave were intact when an
antiquities inspector accidentally found the burial shaft.
   Officials who entered the grave found the mummy. She wore a
bronze crown covered with gold leaf on her head and jewelry around
her neck.
   Jewelry, pottery, wooden items, a piece of glass, flint,
obsidian, a clove of garlic and more than a dozen teeth lay nearby.
The wood and garlic may have been placed in the grave to keep
insects away.
   The mummy was not identified, but Hassan said the woman's
nobility was established both by the finery buried with her and the
site of her burial, a cemetery reserved for officials of the ruling
court.
   She was about 22 years old when she died and stood five feet
tall, Hassan said. He said the body dates from the Fifth Dynasty,
which lasted from 2465 B.C. to 2323 B.C. He said he dated her body
from that dynasty because other bodies in the cemetery were from
that period.
   Her body is so dried out that it has been wrapped in foam for
protection and bound beneath the head.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the Giza area, said the new
mummy might have been an important person reburied for safekeeping
in the shaft where she was found.
   Two vast cemeteries lie under Giza Plateau, one with royal tombs
to the east of the Cheops pyramid. To the west lies the one with the
new mummy, put into use five years into the reign of Cheops 4,600
years ago.
   Inspectors have identified the owner of the complex in which the
shaft was found as S-ankh Ptah, but his position under the pharaohs
and his relation with the mummy remain mysteries.
   Egyptologists hope the mummy can provide clues into early
mummification, an art of preservation that spanned more than 3,000
years of Egyptian history into Christian times.
   ``Any find in the Giza area in such a condition is a great
addition to archaeology,'' said Hassan. ``This mummy changes our
concept of preservation and mummification and provides a new date
for (it).''
   The earliest true mummy is that of Waty, found in the tomb of a
court singer called Nefer at Sakkara. Waty's mummy dates from the
late Fifth Dynasty and was preserved so well by resin-soaked
bandages that even a callus on the sole of a foot is visible.
   Egyptians mummified their dead for thousands of years and was
refined over the ages using a solution of naturally occurring
preservative compounds.
   An obstacle to unraveling mysteries that still surround the
mummification process is that the ancients left incomplete pictorial
records of the embalming ritual.
   Some say the art of mummification was too sacred to be revealed.

   Even death couldn't free some workers
from their bosses, archaeologists are finding in a newly discovered
cemetery near the pyramids.
   It's the first burial ground ever found for the Egyptian working
man of 45 centuries ago.
   Five other cemeteries with 4,000 tombs flank the pyramids, on
the horizon above. But all 4,000 were reserved for royalty, their
families and officials, said Zahi Hawass, director-general of
antiquities for the pyramids area and the new dig's excavation
chief.
   ``What we haven't found until now is the working class,'' said
Hawass. ``We were shocked when we looked at inscriptions of who was
buried in the new tombs. Overseers holding their sticks. And
behind, skeletons of workers.''
   He said it appears the workers were members of the foremen's
crews.
   The first eight tombs, three miles south of the Sphinx, lie at
the base of sand hills stretching endlessly into the desert. Hawass
said the cemetery undoubtedly extends deep into the dunes.
   Tombs date from the fourth dynasty - 4,600 years ago when the
Giza pyramids were built - until the sixth, 300 years later. It's a
mysterious period when legend says workers grew tired of almighty
pharaohs and of building pyramids for them.
   Because no middle-class burials had been discovered on sacred
Giza plateau, some Egyptologists have theorized that the afterlife
was perceived as off-limits to the working man. But the new
cemetery proves that pharaonic blue-collar workers prepared for
eternity as their betters did, being buried with amulets, limestone
tablets, offering tables, pottery vessels and more.
   The largest tomb, built for a fifth-dynasty overseer named
Ptah-Shepses, is 20 feet by 6{ feet with an arched ceiling.
   To the rear of the tomb, in a honeycomb of compartments,
excavators found six skeletons buried in the fetal position. Hawass
said they were members of one work crew.
   Ancient Egyptians didn't practice human sacrifice, so the
workers were not killed and buried at the same time as their
bosses. And Hawass said there's no indication so far how a foreman
chose the workers to be buried near him.
   ``Perhaps they were his favorites. Or perhaps we'll find others
when we keep digging,'' Hawass said. ``We have no idea how many
people an overseer would have had on his staff.''
   Foremen handled day-to-day administration of the pharaohs'
estates, with responsibilities comparable to farm managers or
assembly-line supervisors in today's world. ``They dressed better,
ate better and wanted better tombs than the men who worked for
them,'' Hawass said.
   ``They looked at the pyramids and the fancy tombs of the
officials. They knew they couldn't afford such luxury. Still they
wanted a nice place to spend eternity.''
   More information about the ancient blue-collar workers will come
from medical tests Egyptian doctors are performing on the
skeletons. Data is expected to indicate the workers' general
appearance, their height and weight, what they ate, what diseases
bothered them, even what killed them.
   In 1987, Hawass and Egyptologist Mark Lehner of Yale University
began a search for homes of workers who built the three Giza
pyramids. At a site some distance from the monuments, they
uncovered ruins of a business center and other artifacts.
   They stopped excavating in early 1988. The recently discovered
tombs lay undetected only a few feet away.
   But early last summer, a tourist hired a saddle horse for a ride
around the pyramids. During the tour her horse fell through the
sand, ending on top of what proved to be the roof of the first
tomb.
   Nobody got the tourist's name, and chances are she still doesn't
know her outing made history.
   For years, riders heading for the most spectacular view of the
pyramids have passed in front of the Sphinx and through an ancient
stone gate into the desert.
   No records existed to explain the gate.
   But ``once we found the cemetery we understood,'' Hawass said.
``The gate divided the world of the pharaohs from the world of the
average man.''
   He explained that the foremen and their crews lived and were
buried in their own world behind the gate. By day they passed
through the gate into their pharaoh's sacred world, then returned
at sunset to work on their own tombs.

   A tomb built 4,300 years ago for a
palace official and his two wives has been found in the shadow of
the Giza Pyramids, the first unknown tomb discovered on the plateau
since the mid-1950s.
   ``This is the first time we've seen such a tomb,'' said Zahi
Hawass, director general of the pyramids area. ``We can find no
parallel to this tomb during the Old Kingdom.''
   Giza inspector Mahmoud Hassan Afife found the new tomb in
October when he chanced upon the edge of a limestone wall. ``We
looked at the old records to see what early excavators had recorded
in this spot. There was nothing.''
   Hieroglyphics revealed the tomb owner's name, that he was a
``purification priest'' who handled religious rituals, and that he
was a palace official.
   Hawass dates it to the end of the Fifth Dynasty, about 200 years
after the death in 2528 B.C. of Pharaoh Cheops, builder of the
Great Pyramid.
   Built of limestone blocks, the 26-foot by 66-foot oblong tomb,
called a mastaba, stands over a shaft 23 feet deep that was sealed
with mud bricks after bodies were lowered into it. The mastaba had
no inner chambers.
   On one side, ancient artists carved two false doors with the
owner's name, Per-N-Ankh. The doors face a courtyard with six
limestone columns describing him and his wives Mitrt Nefer and
N-Hwy.
   The winter archaeology season was a month old when Afife found
the tomb, and vigorous excavation has continued since. On a recent
morning, a sandstorm so engulfed the dig that workers used rubber
buckets to shield their heads from the sand. Debris cascaded onto
the tomb's base faster than diggers could dig.
   Suddenly, from deep in a shaft, a workman yelled, ``gumgumah,''
Arabic for ``skull.'' As a man above slowly turned a pulley, a
reddish-gold skull creaked its way up the pit. It appears to be a
female's, in excellent condition.
   Such a find testifies to the site's value. Nearby pits have
yielded piles of pottery shards, bones and wooden pieces that
officials said might be part of a bed or other funerary furniture
to accompany the dead into the afterlife. In an adjacent tomb were
two limestone statues of wives of pharaonic officials.
   Hawass said he knew valuable leftovers would emerge from
re-excavation of the vast Western Cemetery, begun in the fifth year
of Cheops' reign. Officials and their families used the cemetery
over the centuries, building limestone and mud-brick tombs along
avenues of various sizes.
   ``Some Egyptologists thought the area wouldn't give anything
else, but they're wrong. Early excavators were in a hurry, Indiana
Jones-style. Some even used dynamite,'' he said. ``This tomb lies
at the edge of the cemetery. Earlier this century archaeologists
dumped their dirt onto these hills without checking to see if
anything interesting lay underneath.
   ``Chances are even more tombs still lie just over there.''
   Excavating leftovers is ``never a waste of time, never
busywork,'' said Amal Samuel, Giza's chief inspector, who estimates
that as many as 4,000 tombs and pits exist in the area known as the
Western Cemetery. ``When people dug in the past they only searched
for treasure. Today, we're looking for history. We never think if
we'll find something or not.''
   Last spring archaeologists clearing another part of the cemetery
found the well-preserved, gypsum-masked head of a female mummy from
about the same period, her faint smile reminiscent of the Mona
Lisa's.
   Giza Plateau has two great cemeteries: the Eastern, between the
Great Pyramid and the Sphinx, and the Western, wedged between the
pyramids of Cheops and Chephren. Generally, queens and royal
offspring are buried in the Eastern Cemetery, officials and their
families in the Western.
   The cemeteries of mastabas were arranged in parallel rows
several feet apart, with ownership planned carefully. Everybody
wanted to be buried in the pyramids area, seeking special benefits
in life after death. Over the years, as demand increased, the
symmetry went askew. Small tombs of officials and priests were
placed among the once neat rows until the area was honeycombed.
   ``We have to think of these cemeteries as a community that
surrounded the king with the same feeling as when he was alive,''
said Hawass. ``At the top of his pyramid is the pharaoh, the head
of his country. Around him lay those who would have been near him,
his family and officials. ... Those closest are in the Eastern
cemetery, just like in a palace.''

   The falling of a piece of rock from
the crumbling body of the Sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate
over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and Egypt's other
ancient treasures.
   The principal casualty of the uproar has been Ahmed Kadry,
formerly chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni, of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly
on Kadry's stewardship of the Sphinx and the other relics of
Egypt's rich past. Hosni did not reply to the accusation.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb.
7, six days after a sandstorm buffeted Giza Plateau.
   A restoration plan is in the works. The Sphinx has been fitted
with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early
stages of the effort, and a committee of experts has taken rock
samples for analysis to help decide what steps to take.
   The Sphinx, which is 66 feet high and 160 feet long, has the
head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion. Many
Egyptologists think the face is that of Chephren, son of Cheops and
builder of the second pyramid on Giza Plateau next to Cheops' Great
Pyramid.
   A similiar accident six years ago brought down Kadry's
predecessor, Fouad Oraby, and a Sphinx-restoration project that
Kadry began as antiquities chairman remained unfinished when the
latest rock fell.
   Zahi Hawass, general director of the pyramids area and
archaeology adviser to Hosni, will direct the latest restoraton and
conservation efforts.
   The earliest restoration of the Sphinx began 3,600 years ago.
   ``Two hundred years from now all our monuments will be
finished,'' Hawass told The Associated Press.
   ``In the past the monuments were safe from many factors that
destroy them because they were buried in the sand. The monuments
were not subjected to pollution, the environment, tourists, the
things that are ruining them now.''
   The emergency work on the Sphinx should be finished by late
March, with fallen pieces of limestone replaced and weak places
beneath the neck and shoulders treated, Hawass said. Made of weaker
limestone than other parts, the neck long has been considered a
chronic problem.
   After the emergency work, experts will draw up an overall
restoration plan, Hawass said.
   A major problem, said Omar el-Arini, Cairo representative of the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, is that previous
restorers have not learned why the Sphinx continues to decay.
   ``In a nutshell, we have been looking at symptoms of the
problems, not the problems themselves,'' he said.
   ``We have been treating it as a rock carved 4,600 years ago, but
the limestone is 40 million years old. Our approach should be to
look at an object of 40 million years.''
   One of the problems facing the team will be how to rid the
monument of salt, which is visible on many portions of the body.
   Shawky Nakhla, chief restorer for the Antiquity Organization,
said restoration efforts in the 1940s and 1950s added to the
Sphinx's salt problem.
   ``They used cement, and a lot of salt started appearing,'' he
said. ``We don't know if a high water table level below the Sphinx
is a real cause of the salt problems, or whether the salt is coming
out of the limestone itself.''

<HEAD>Sewer Workers Discover Remains of Cheops' Long-Lost Temple</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NAZLETT EL-SAMMAN, Egypt (AP) _ Sewer workers have discovered
remains of a temple that Pharaoh Cheops built for his funeral 4,600
years ago, and Egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more
about the mysterious pharaoh of the Great Pyramid.
   The discovery this month of Cheop's Valley Temple confirms
theories about the layout of Giza Plateau for the 70-year period in
which the pharaoh, his son and grandson built their three pyramids
and monuments nearby.
   Nazlett el-Samman lies at the foot of the plateau, facing the
Sphinx, and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause
of the Sphinx's dangerous deterioration. A U.S.-financed sewage
project began last year, and Egyptologists were assigned to monitor
construction because of the probability of finding antiquities.
   They were on hand in early March as diggers began uncovering
mammoth granite and limestone blocks, a flint knife, Roman brick
walls and other relics.
   By mid-March, more remains were turning up, and finally the main
prize _ a 59-foot-long row of basalt rocks. The experts identified
it as the floor for Cheops' Valley Temple.
   Because basalt is difficult to carve and expensive, the stone
was reserved for royal use, often as flooring for sacred places.
   Although his pyramid was the largest ever built, Cheops left few
other glimpses of his life or his 23-year reign, which ended in
2528 B.C.
   ``With what we're finding now, we can piece together Cheops'
history and reconstruct how this part of the pyramids area would
have looked,'' said Zahi Hawass of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization.
   The newly found ruins lie 13 feet below street level, partially
covered with sewage.
   Getting to them will not be easy. Diggers already are excavating
two Roman-era sites in a Nazlett el-Samman alley only a foot from
village houses. Archaeologists have to contend with children at
play, donkeys and angry villagers worried that antiquities
officials might invoke their legal authority to force them from
their houses.
   Cheops' Valley Temple is proving an even greater challenge.
Engineers for the sewer project are pumping water from the drainage
ditch where the basalt flooring was found.
   The Giza Pyramids and the structures around them are thought by
some Egyptologists to be part of an elaborate blueprint for the
dead, precisely planned and executed. But their exact roles in the
death and resurrection of the pharaohs are debated.
   Burial was an elaborate ritual to ensure that neither the
pharaoh nor Egypt would ever die.
   The journey to eternity began in the Valley Temple, where the
pharaoh's body was taken for ritual purification, perhaps
embalming. For the final rituals, the body was carried up the long
causeway to a mortuary temple next to the pyramid.
   Early travelers' descriptions of the pyramids area had given
modern egyptogists a good idea where Cheops' temple should be found.
   In the fifth century B.C., the Greek Herodotus wrote that he saw
Cheops' causeway, covered and decorated with carved animal scenes.
The German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius said only traces remained
of the ruined causeway by the early 1840s.

   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said Zahi Hawass, the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director-general for the
pyramids area. ``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize
the outer stones, there could be a tragedy.
   ``People have a tendency to think that pyramids will be here
forever because they're so massive, but each is suffering from wind
and sand erosion, rain and salt (and) ... to a great extent because
of the hands of man.''
   Work began inside the Great Pyramid last winter to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone and accumulated along passageway
walls. The work on the outside began in late August.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In 1976, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, Hawass said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with Cheops Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.
   Historical records and legends indicate the first man-made
damage occurred as early as 500 years after the death of Cheops,
the second pharaoh of ancient Egypt's Fourth Dynasty. The Egyptians
were in revolt against tyrannical and oppressive practices of the
past, hacking and destroying statues and monuments from the earlier
days of the pharaohs.
   Less than a century later, the 12th-dynasty Pharoah Amenemhet
took many stones from Cheops' pyramid complex to build one for
himself at el-Lisht, south of Giza Plateau. Teams from New York's
Metropolitan Museum, who excavated Amenemhet's pyramid, found
hundreds of the decorated pieces.
   Nobody knows when or why, but the Great Pyramid at some time
lost 30 feet of height, leaving it still enormous at almost 453
feet. Its outer surface originally was covered with a protective
layer of fine, hard limestone, only traces of which survived
desecration and looting.
   Thousands of its stones were stolen over time, but the pyramid
remained structurally intact until the late ninth century, writes
I.E.S. Edwards, the British Egyptologist acknowledged as the
authority on Egyptian pyramids.
   At that time, Arab raiders broke a large hole just below the
main entrance and entered the monument in a vain search for
treasure, Edwards wrote in his showpiece work ``The Pyramids of
Egypt.''
   ``Subsequently it became a copious and convenient quarry,
providing the stone required for bridges over irrigation canals,
houses, walls and other buildings in the neighborhood of Giza and
Cairo,'' he wrote.
   In the early 19th century, the Albanian Mohammed Ali, credited
with creating the modern Egyptian state as part of the Ottoman
Empire, thought nothing of using blocks from Cheops and other
pyramids for construction.
   The English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie wrote in the 1880s of
watching as a steady stream of camels, hundreds daily, carried
massive blocks into Cairo from nearby Abu Rawash pyramid, built by
Cheops' successor Djedefre.
   Today the pyramid area is littered with toppled building blocks.

   After a year of scientific debate,
archaeologists still can't figure out how to keep the Sphinx from
falling apart.
   It's been almost six months since workmen made emergency repairs
and replaced a stone that fell Feb. 7, 1988, from the crouching
lion's right shoulder.
   But the experts can't decide what to do next.
   ``Scholars from Egypt and around the world have given us good
advice, but not one has been able to come up with a sure way to save
our wonderful Sphinx,'' said Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's top
archaeological official.
   As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, Tawfik is
caretaker of Egypt's enormous treasurehouse of the past.
   ``In all the world there's only one Sphinx like this,'' he said.
``We love him and don't want to do anything to injure him. This is
why we have an international panel studying where to go from here.''
   The Sphinx, with its wide-eyed stare and smug expression, has
undergone the jabs and probes of restorers almost since anonymous
artisans sculpted the half-man, half-beast 4,600 years ago at the
base of Giza's pyramids plateau.
   None of the intermittent remedies has been able to stop
occasional rock falls.
   Major falls touch off political uproars in Cairo.
   A tumbling rock in 1982 cost the job of the antiquities chairman
at that time.
   Last year's rockfall brought the departure of Ahmed Kadry,
pressured out of office because of a vocal and highly public row
with his boss, Farouk Hosni, the minister of culture. Tawfik was
appointed to replace him in December.
   Such sensitivity illustrates the Sphinx's monumental importance
to the Egyptians. Ancient Egypt was a cat-worshiping country, and
the Sphinx remains a very personal and popular cat.
   At times mostly buried in desert sand, at times not, the Sphinx
has survived into the late 20th century as one of world's best-known
relics, although bruised and battered.
   Nobody knows how or why or when it lost its nose and pharaoh's
beard, but they are the most obvious reminders of the unseen
stresses at work.
   Tawfik said he believes the ancient stonemasons knew the Sphinx
wouldn't survive as long as the pyramids of Giza, which form a
backdrop against the horizon.
   Some of the Sphinx's building blocks are as strong as those of
the pyramids, he said, but others, especially in the neck, shoulder
and rear haunches, are weaker.
   ``Perhaps they knew after 4,000 years or so the Sphinx couldn't
survive any longer,'' said Tawfik, an archaeology professor. ``I
think the Sphinx is a decoration of Giza Plateau, a unique one, not
a monument for eternity as were other monuments.''
   The first known effort to help the Sphinx was 3,400 years ago. As
recorded in stone, the prince who would become Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV
followed an order that came to him in a dream during a daytime nap
to remove the sand from the Sphinx. He did so and, as promised in
the dream, the Sphinx repaid him by arranging for him to usurp the
throne of Egypt.
   Fourteen centuries later, Roman technicians performed emergency
restorations at a time when the pyramids and the Sphinx already were
drawing tourists from around the Mediterranean.
   In modern times, foreign and Egyptian teams have had a go at
stopping the decay. Applying mudpacks to remove salt clusters and
injecting glue down its throat didn't work. More drastic suggestions
like reburying the monument in sand or encasing it in glass arise
from time to time.
   In the year since the stone fell, experts from Egypt, Germany,
Italy, France, the United States and other countries have given
advice on how to proceed.
   Egyptian geologists are studying rock samples. Specialists are
monitoring desert winds that blast the Sphinx. Pollution experts are
studying the effects of dirty air. Water and soil technicians are
testing the water table level on and near Giza Plateau, checking
whether subterranean water is causing salt to weaken the limestone.
   Even so, the Giza Plateau's antiquities director, Zahi Hawass,
remains optimistic.
   ``I believe for the first time in its history we are able to save
the Sphinx,'' Hawass said, explaining that advanced scientific
findings in many fields are being applied to archaeological work.
   But for the Sphinx, he said, time is passing fast.
   ``He's like a suffering old man who needs an operation. But what
kind? When the rock fell (last year), it was kind of a red flag,''
Hawass said. ``At that time the government appointed a committee to
decide what to do. We're still meeting.''
   And it will continue to meet, he said, until it comes up with a
plan that won't repeat the earlier restoration efforts that harmed
the Sphinx more than they helped.

   Experts have started conducting tests
to determine how to repair the Sphinx, the ancient monument that
lost a chunk of stone from its right shoulder.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx Feb. 7, six days after a
sandstorm buffeted Giza Plateau.
   Damage to the Sphinx caused heated political and scientific
debate over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and Egypt's
other ancient treasures.
   The main casualty of the unrest was Ahmed Kadry, until early
February chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni, of staging the rock fall to reflect badly on Kadry's
stewardship of the Sphinx and, by extension, the other relics of
Egypt's rich past.
   Restoration work began on the Sphinx on Monday.
   The monument was fitted with sandbags for support and
scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort.
   A committee of experts took rock samples to test for salt
content and damage and to see whether the stone is strong enough to
hold iron bars that will be inserted to strengthen it.
   Tests also are being conducted to determine what kind of mortar
should be used to cement the rock in place.
   ``We're not in a hurry. We want to do things right,'' said Zahi
Hawass, general director of the pyramids area and director of the
restoration.
   The Sphinx has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching
lion. Many Egyptologists think the face belonged to Chephren, son
of Cheops and builder of the second pyramid on Giza Plateau next to
Cheops' Great Pyramid.
   Any damage to the pyramids or the Sphinx _ symbols of the past
with deep emotional overtones for modern Egyptians _ brings instant
outcries in Cairo's national press. The rock fall proved no
exception, to Kadry's chagrin, and charges of incompetence and
corruption flooded the newspapers.

   Specialists investigating why the Sphinx is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village and a hotel favored by the rich and famous. 

   Cries of alarm were raised in early February, after a chunk of limestone fell from the 4,500-year-old statue's right shoulder. 
Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as evidence the monument was near collapse. 

   A committee of specialists from Egypt, France, West Germany and Italy probed, scraped and tested the stone for four months to see what is happening to one of the world's best-known ancient monuments. 

   The answer is quickened decay, and the reason is sewage, said Zahi Hawass, an Egyptologist and director general of the pyramids area where the Sphinx has crouched since the Old Kingdom. 

   Mr. Hawass blamed sewage water flowing freely from the nearby tourist village of Nazlet al-Samman and an inadequate sewage system at the well-known Mena House Hotel. 

   Once a sleepy town at the edge of the desert, Nazlet al-Samman has mushroomed in the past 20 years with an injection of funds earned by locals in the Persian Gulf oil countries. 
The town boasts an ever-sprouting array of tourist shops selling pharaonic bric-a-brac, with names like Moses' Place, Pharaoh's Perfume Factory and Cleo's Bazaar. 

   Just to the northwest is the Mena House Hotel, built in 1868 with 150 rooms to house dignitaries assembled for the opening of the Suez Canal. 

   The stately hotel's reputation grew over the decades, as it hosted Charlie Chaplin, British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter, and Winston Churchill and others. 
In 1974, 400 rooms were added. 

   Mr. Hawass said that no sewage system was installed to meet the needs of the bustling village and that the hotel's system was inadequate for its expanded size. 
Thus, excess waste water entered the water table and undermined the Sphinx. 

   Before the recent study, Mr. Hawass said, it was assumed the statue was deteriorating because of changes in the underground water table, caused by the Aswan High Dam's regulation of the Nile River's flow. 

   Now that the cause of the damage is determined, he said, work will begin on repairing it. 

   Egyptian specialists are being joined by others from West Germany, Britain and the University of Louisville in the U.S. to formulate a long-term save-the-Sphinx plan. 

   The government already has allocated $2.3 million for a new sewage system aimed at halting the dirty-water flow beneath and around the Sphinx, Mr. Hawass said. 

   A committee set up to oversee repairs met yesterday and approved plans to have a masonry support of limestone blocks laid just below where the chunk of rock fell in February, then to replace the rock on July 9. 

   Mr. Hawass said restoration work in recent years, especially an effort that began in 1982 and that was stopped when the latest piece fell, didn't match ancient attempts to protect the monument. 
The first on record was a patch-up campaign that began 1,000 years after the Sphinx was created about 2,500 B.C. 

   Mr. Hawass said cement used to secure loose rocks after 1982 had turned the limestone to powder. 
"The cement didn't allow the rocks to breathe," he said. 
"Now we're removing all the cement and testing gypsum mixed with rocks from Giza Plateau itself to see if the mix can't protect sensitive areas." 

   The team of local and foreign specialists also is to study the effects on the Sphinx of Cairo's air pollution, which on most days can be seen from Giza hovering in layers above the city of 12 million. 

   Next to the Cheops Pyramid, the Sphinx is the most popular among Egypt's thousands of monuments. 
But as Egyptians laugh at many of the modern world's tribulations, they have chuckled at the Sphinx's sewage problem through newspaper cartoons. 

   In one cartoon, the Sphinx has lost his ever-present subtle smile and says, "I don't care whether they call it waste water or sewage runoff, this stuff stinks." 

   In another cartoon, pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus, builders of the world's three most famous pyramids on the plateau behind the Sphinx, stand before an immigration officer, obviously ready to leave town. 
"We don't care what country you choose," one pharoah says, "as long as it has a sewage system."

   Experts investigating why the Sphinx
is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village
and a hotel favored by the rich and famous.
   Cries of alarm were raised in early February after a chunk of
limestone fell from the 4,500-year-old statue's right shoulder.
Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously
ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as

   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, the most
famous of ancient Egypt's royal tombs, was declared safe for
tourists and reopened Saturday for the first time in nine months.
   A Dutch woman and an American student were the first of the
scores of tourists who waited under the hot Egyptian sun to tour
the pyramid.
   Since August, workers had been sealing cracks, reinforcing
limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of
the magnificent structure, which now boasts television monitors.
   The restoration project was the first step in a five-year plan
to transform the pyramid area, including the Sphinx, into an
open-air museum.
   Gasping after the 155-foot climb to the King's Chamber, Sophie
D'Lang of Rotterdam said she and her husband were spending the last
day of a vacation in Egypt.
   ``I didn't think we had a chance to see inside Cheops,'' said
Mrs. D'Lang, who waited more than three hours for the re-opening.
``I think what they've done is great.''
   Michael Saxton of Dayton, Ohio, said he waited four hours. ``For
me the pyramid has special meaning because of the way it's built.
It's amazing.''
   The Great Pyramid is Egypt's top tourist attraction, and tourist
officials protested when it was closed Aug. 15.
   But the Egyptian Antiquities Organization prevailed with the
argument that newly discovered cracks in blocks lining interior
passages and a half-inch layer of salt on inside walls had to be
fixed without interruption by tourists.
   With a base of 13.1 acres, it stood at 481.4 feet when it was
built 4,600 years ago. Today, it is 31 feet shorter after losing
about a dozen layers and its capstone. It also has lost almost all
its outer facing of hard, white limestone, stripped for use in
stone bridges, irrigation canals, houses, walls and buildings.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the pyramids area, said nothing
had been done to restore the pyramid's interior since it was opened
in the late 1830s.
   Hawass said in removing salt from the limestone walls, restorers
found weak and cracking rock throughout the pyramid.
   In the Grand Gallery, Hawass said, 500 limestone blocks were
restored and 16 granite slabs reinforced with stainless steel bars.
``Some of these slabs were in critical condition,'' he said.
   Cheops' lidless red granite sarcophagus, soiled by the touch of
generations of tourists, was cleaned of soot, grease and other
filth, Hawass said.
   He said insects and rats, which had invaded the pyramid, were
exterminated. Television monitors were installed to ensure that
visitors behave themselves.
   During the renovation, rubble was cleared and lighting added to
a chamber winding 396 feet beneath the pyramid, opening it to
tourists for the first time.
   Of the seven monuments listed as Wonders of the World by Greeks
of the second century B.C., only Cheops and the other two large
Giza pyramids remain intact.
   The remaining monuments on the list _ the statue of Zeus in
Olympia, Artemis' temple in Ephesus, the Colossus of Rhodes, the
mausoleum of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor and the Pharos lighthouse
in Alexandria _ were destroyed by warfare or earthquakes.

<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists have unearthed Egypt's oldest bakery, where bakers laboring in
smoke-filled rooms turned out thousands of loaves every day for hungry

feed 30,000 people a day," said Egyptologist Mark Lehner of the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The well-preserved bakery, with a hearth, dough vats and bread pots, dates
from Giza Plateau's pyramid-building days, which began with the fourth dynasty
in 2575 B.C. Experts say it's the oldest bakery found in Egypt, perhaps in the
world.;   To ancient Egyptians, king or commoner, bread was an everyday
staple, taken with a bit of onion or garlic and a swig of beer. Money didn't
exist, and bread was doled out as partial payment to those who inched massive
stones into the towering pyramids that still evoke awe after 4,600 years.;  
14 kinds of bread; Records from the period describe at least 14 kinds of
bread. So far the team of American and Egyptian Egyptologists working 1 1/2
miles from the Sphinx has found three kinds of bread molds: small and large
bell-shaped, and flat trays. The largest earthenware molds weigh 22 pounds.;  
The dig began in October, financed by business executives David Koch of New
York and Bruce Ludwig of Los Angeles. Diggers found the bakery in November.
After the season's work ends this month, team members plan to study the art of
bread-making using ingredients available then.;   "I have to admit I'm not a
baking expert, which would help," said Lehner, the excavation's co-director.
He said tomb artists left some baking clues, though much was left to the
imagination.;   Bread-baking is pictured on tomb walls of a fifth-dynasty
official named Ty in the cemetery of Sakkara south of the pyramids.;   "We
didn't know for sure until now that this scene was real. We didn't have a
bakery to compare it with," said expedition co-director Zahi Hawass, in charge
of antiquities in the pyramids-Sakkara area.;   Baked in clay pots; A room in
the bakery contains three large earthenware vats beside rows of grooves for
bread pots lined up like eggs in a carton.;   The excavation has revealed
generally how bakers did their work. They took a "bedja," a heated, greased
bread pot, and put the rounded end into a baking pit. They poured in the dough
and placed an inverted pot on top. Both pots were covered with heated coals
and ash, causing the dough to rise and bake.;   For those making the bread,
working conditions were nightmarish.;   Heat was intense. Smoke was so thick
"these rooms would have been like a night sky filled with rain," Lehner said.
"We've dug through 1 1/2 feet of black-velvet, built-up ash."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   More than 4,200 years ago, Pharaoh
Pepy I heard one of his queens was plotting against him. He sent
Weni the Scribe to find out.
   Weni did. History didn't.
   Guilty or innocent? Cunning or faithful?
   Pepy's hapless queens have been suspects ever since.
   Now a French-Egyptian archaeological team, digging and recording
a queenly pyramid field 20 miles south of Cairo, is on its way to
unraveling one of ancient Egypt's most tantalizing intrigues.
   ``We have mention of three Pepy queens'' in ancient texts, ``and
now we have three burials,'' said Vassil Dobrev, a Bulgarian-born
Egyptologist on the team led by French historian Jean Leclant. ``As
we search on, we'll find the answers.''
   Which was the queen in question, and did she do it?
   Weni went to his grave with the secret, leaving a record of his
investigation that ended: ``I know the truth.''
   The scribe's silence did not enhance the pharaoh's reputation.
Pepy I, who died in 2255 B.C. after a 34-year reign, is remembered
for two things: an ability to keep Egypt's far-flung, troublesome
colonies in line and an inability to do the same with his queens.
   Early grave robbers, peasants revolting against the pharaohs and
generations of stone thieves left few clues to the alleged
conspiracy intact. The pyramids of Pepy's queens were so completely
ransacked that restorers work alongside archaeologists to minimize
the danger of falling walls.
   Generations of sycophantic tomb artists depicted ancient
Egyptian queens as perfect mates: beautiful, submissive, adoring.
   Egyptologist Zahi Hawass said the story of Pepy and his queen
shows that some ancient royal marriages were less than ideal,
especially since pharaohs had to deal with multiple wives and had
both major and minor queens.
   A pharaoh's chief queen, as consort of a god, received special
privileges, including the title ``great royal wife.'' Because of
the numerous other royal offspring, a young pharaoh-to-be often
married his sister to enhance his right to the throne.
   A few queens even managed to rule Egypt.
   ``We can understand the queens' importance by their tombs,''
said Hawass, who directs the pharaonic cemeteries of Giza and
Sakkara to the south. ``The largest was the pharaoh's tomb. After
all, he ruled Egypt. His tomb had to show that power.
   ``But directly after his tomb in size came the queens', then the
princes', then the nobles' and officials'; a cemetery easily shows
their ranks in life.''
   Allegations of a palace plot by a main queen was taken so
seriously that Weni was allowed inside the forbidden harem to
investigate the rumors. Hawass said Weni left no record of the
queen's name, referring to her only as a ``main consort'' of the
pharaoh.
   Until this dig, the only Pepy wives whose names were known were
Ankh-nes-meryre I and Ankn-nes-meryre II. Both were recorded by an
official named Khui, who said the king married two of his family
members. It is unlikely either sister would have been the main
queen because their blood wasn't royal enough.
   So who was the alleged plotter? Dobrev and his colleagues, who
are at the end of the dig for the season, hope the answer lies in
the third pyramid.
   The French-Egyptian expedition first came to South Sakkara, site
of the pyramids of Pepy I and his pharaoh sons Merenre and Pepy II,
in 1965.
   Its task was to record the last of the Old Kingdom's great
pyramid complexes on the edge of a 3-square-mile stretch of desert
graves spanning 3,000 years.
   Pepy I's pyramid proved particularly important because of
intricately carved texts of spells, rituals and myths designed to
help propel the soul of the dead pharaoh into the afterlife.
   For two decades, archaeologists were too busy to look for his
queens, but by 1988 high technology was available to help. Experts
combed 50 acres of rubble-strewn dunes adjacent to Pepy's pyramid
with ultrasound equipment developed in France.
   Soundings monitored by French technicians pinpointed two good
possibilities. The team started digging, and found two queens'
pyramids.
   A portion of a third pyramid was discovered last year, wedged
between the first two and roughly the same size, about 66 feet tall.
   Three pyramids. Three queens.
   Diggers began excavating the new pyramid early this year,
uncovering pottery shards, a chapel, a passageway and a burial
chamber.
   By the time digging ended March 28, there were two important
clues that could help solve the mystery of the accused queen.
   One was the name Nub-Unet on wall reliefs. The queen was unknown
to Egyptologists and may have been the royal wife Weni described.
She was buried in the eastern pyramid.
   The second clue was an empty basalt sarcophagus, its lid buried
beneath two massive boulders that once closed the burial chamber of
the middle pyramid.
   Dobrev hopes the lid, when uncovered, will bear the name of the
queen and something about her, but that is next season's work.
   Hawass thinks he knows what Weni the Scribe left unsaid about
Pepy's queen.
   ``Weni bragged that he alone investigated and he alone knew the
truth,'' the cemetery director said. ``He had solved the problem.
That's where the tale ends.
   ``I think Weni told Pepy his queen was not guilty, because Pepy
would never have allowed her to be buried next to him if she had
done something so evil.''

   Lanny Bell, director of Chicago House, a special arm of the
University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, has wrestled for 11
years with how to save decaying monuments in southern Egypt's Luxor
area, the greatest concentration of monuments on earth.
   Using photography and hand drawings, Chicago House is recording
some of Egypt's best-known monuments before they disappear.
   ``In many respects the modern Egyptians live in a huge outdoor
museum, and museums are to be visited,'' Bell said. ``The question
remains one of finding the best way to display an artifact, even an
artifact as large as a temple, to best advantage.''
   Most Egyptian monuments were built as places of worship with
restricted entry. Bell said the dilemma for antiquities officials is
keeping monuments in their natural settings while insulating them
against tourist hordes.
   ``Tourism is both necessary and desirable,'' he said. ``But if
the present rate of decay continues, as it has for 100 years, there
will be no need for tourists 200 years from now to visit Luxor for
its monuments.''
   Zahi Hawass, who controls Giza Plateau, Egypt's best-known
tourist area, is trying to make it safer both for tourists and its
monuments, the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx. He hopes television
monitors being installed inside the pyramids can stop tourist antics
that began 1,100 years ago when treasure hunters forced their way
into Cheops Pyramid.
   ``For the past 100 years this place has been a zoo, and for the
past 50 years antiquities authorities have had no plans to protect
the monuments from tourists,'' Hawass said. ``Our biggest problem in
Egypt is we have no concept that a monument should be a national
park, where people come to enjoy but behave.''
   Tourism has become Egypt's second largest earner of foreign
currency, with almost 2 million visitors in 1988 spending more than
$2 billion. The Tourism Promotion Board's Moussa wants to double the
number within a few years.
   Moussa said officials recognize the appeal of Egypt's monuments
but must look beyond history to encourage mass tourism.
   ``If you're thinking of coming to Egypt only for its monuments,
you can always put it off, because the monuments will still be
here,'' he said.
   ``Our best bet to help both tourism and monuments is to provide a
number of alternative sites throughout the country, drawing tourists
away from congested monuments. We also can help find ways to stem
the tourist flow into popular sites.''
   Tourism officials and the World Bank have devised a plan they say
will ease congestion in the temples and tombs on Luxor's West Bank.
It includes new roads and a visitors' center that will control
visits to the main attractions by computer.
   Two of the most famous tombs in the Valley of the Kings _ Seti I
and Tutankhamun _ are endangered but remain open to the public.
   A year ago the frail tomb of Seti I was reopened after
restoration. A few weeks later, a zodiac design painted on its
ceiling, unique among Egyptian monuments, came crashing to the floor.
   Workers are restoring the zodiac behind a rope barrier, because
``every time we close Seti, we get objections from tourist
agencies,'' said Upper Egyptian antiquities director Balboush.
   In King Tut's tomb, visited every day of the tourist season by
2,500 and more, scientists found in November that bacteria were
eating away the colorful wall paintings.
   To accommodate tourist traffic, plans were made for restorers to
apply an antidote to the infested walls before and after hours. Once
they saw how serious the infestation was, however, experts decided
to work nonstop for three days.
   Tourists didn't hamper the work: the antidote smelled so foul
that once visitors took a whiff, they rushed out, leaving restorers
to their work.

invading tourists arrive. Tourists make fools of themselves trying to look
comfortable posing for photos on bony camels.;    The best views are those
with a little height, but climbing the pyramids is prohibited. That is, unless
you are there early and the night watchman offers to guide you to the top of
the pyramid for a little baksheesh. The views are stunning, although the
climbing is steep. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, or Cheops, rises 450 feet. Be
sure to bring bottled water, for once the sun emerges, it quickly gets hot.;  
 The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids to be tombs to preserve the bodies
of their kings. Believers in the occult say that mystical vibes are trapped in
the pyramids.;    But all is not well at this seventh wonder of the world. The
Sphinx, buried and unburied throughout the centuries, is deteriorating, having
been exposed to moisture, winds and traffic fumes. The pharaoh's beard is
gone, its nose has crumbled and its skin is pockmarked. Part of its right
shoulder caved in in 1988.;    Serious business;  Egyptians don't take these
things lightly. A 1982 rockfall cost the chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization his job. Now specialists say measures taken to help the Sphinx
may have hurt more than helped. So an international commission was formed to
save the Sphinx.;    Repairs are under way, but the poor Sphinx now has
instruments attached to its rear end to monitor air pollution, wind and
moisture. National Geographic reports that, if you probe below the limestone
base, "a red powder appears, as if the Sphinx were bleeding.";    But, at
least, peddlers are no longer allowed on the pyramid grounds. They just wait
outside for the 8 a.m. starting time.;    An early-rising peddler spies an
American leaving the grounds, and says, "Ah, Bush, Bush, very good." He
reaches into his pocket and pulls out a silver-plated medallion of the Sphinx.
"I want to give this to you to take to America, a souvenir," he says. "I want
to shake your hand. Can you give me a souvenir of some American dollars?" he
says.;    The Persian Gulf war was disastrous to Egypt's tourist industry. "So
far it hasn't picked up," says Hamdi Saad El-Din, director of the Egyptian
Tourist Authority. "People were afraid. But we have never had one incident of
terrorism involving an American. Egypt is a very strong ally. You get the best
value in the world here now because we floated the Egyptian pound.";    Cairo
is remarkably inexpensive. For example, the cost for a car and driver for
three hours was $7.;    A deluxe hotel room at the Intercontinental with a
balcony overlooking the Nile is $100 a night. Silver goods cost one-third of
prices in the States. A pair of engraved silver earrings goes for $9, a good
meal $10.;    At the pyramids, as 8 a.m. nears, it's time to go. The sun is
already beating down on camel drivers, and the shopkeepers squint as they open
their stores. One Egyptian man kisses his camel for the cameras, hoping for a
tip. Another naps near the chairs set up for the evening's sight-and-sound
light show.;    We beat the traffic back into town and have breakfast near
tourists headed to the pyramids.;    Outside, the Nile shimmers and the buses
stutter inch by inch up the avenue toward the pyramids, just outside the city.
It's only 10 a.m., but there's another appointment to keep. It's at the health
club for a massage to soothe the aching muscles. Another bargain -- $6 for an
hour.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Egyptian Tourist Authority, 323 Geary St., Suite

   Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist
area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues
of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a
potential gold mine of historical data.
   Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the
famous Luxor Temple in Luxor, a Nile River city about 450 miles
south of Cairo.
   ``There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of
them are showing,'' Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization. ``We will know more when we dig them up.''
   He said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities
from a 750-year period that ended about 500 B.C., shortly before the
Persians conquered Egypt.
   Displaying the find to President Hosni Mubarak on Friday,
Egyptologist Aly Hassan described it as ``the most important of the
end of the 20th century.''
   Notable from the first half of the century are the discovery of
the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun across the Nile River from Luxor in
1922; a fabulous golden trove found in the Nile Delta at Tanis in
1939; and a dismantled full-size boat found beside the
4,600-year-old pyriamid of Pharaoh Cheops in 1954.
   Hassan said the Luxor Temple discovery turned up by chance on
Jan. 22 during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the
temple's Amenhophis III courtyard, rimmed by towering and majestic
columns.
   Three of the five statues found so far have been identified, he
said.
   One is an 8-foot quartzite statue of Pharaoh Amenhophis III, who
ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C. and founded the existing Luxor Temple.
The others are life-sized or larger.
   Another statue, 5{-feet long and made of black diorite, depicts
the cow-headed goddess Hathor, guardian of women, beauty and love.
The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General
Haremhab, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of
the 18th dynasty after Tutankhamun and his caretaker Aya died.
   He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were
cleaning.
   ``Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so
many tourists each day,'' Hassan said.
   Until Friday, the cache remained covered and under guard.
Antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would
damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns.
   Luxor Temple, an island of stone beauty beside the Nile, is
considered the most endangered monument in the Luxor area,
undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water
flowing beneath it.
   During its construction, the temple underwent continual changes
and additions, including changes ordered by Tutankhamun, Ramses II
and Alexander the Great.
   After the reign of Amenhophis III, ancient Egypt's religion
underwent major upheaval when his son and successor Akhenaten
ordered that a new god, Aten, be given precedence over the existing
array of deities. His agents hacked the name of Amun, the
long-favored god of Thebes, from monuments throughout Egypt.
   The new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence, as the name
Amun was chiseled from Amenhophis's statue. Egyptian officials said
the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of
religious frenzy and violence.
   Antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by
temple priests.
   ``We can expect to find such caches from time to time,'' said
Zahi Hawass, archaeological adviser to the culture minister and
director of Giza Plateau. ``We think these objects were buried by
priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring
throughout the country.''

   Chunks of stone that fell from the
4,500-year-old Sphinx have been returned to their place, and the
statue will undergo emergency restoration at five other weak
points, an official said Wednesday.
   Besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over
the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right
shoulder of the half-man, half-lion, the statue also has been
victim of a ``bad restoration project,'' which had further worsened
its condition, said Zahi Hawass, director general of the Pyramids
area.
   ``The Sphinx is like a suffering old man who needs an
operation,'' Hawass said of the world-reknowned statue, which lies
near the three famed Giza pyramids on Cairo's western outskirts.
   ``There are five weak points where stones can fall off any
minute,'' Hawass said. The worst problems, he added, stem from a
rising water table and a restoration project that ended just last
year.
   Hawass, who was appointed to his post in 1987, estimated the
repair cost at $10 million.
   Since the Sphinx was built of limestone around a large rock
about 2,500 B.C., it has alternated between being buried under the
sand or subjected to restoration projects that were begun by
ancient Egyptian pharoahs.
   About 3,000 years ago, Tuthmosis IV saw in a dream a suffering
Sphinx buried under the sand, which promised him rule of Egypt if
he cleaned up the area. Tuthmosis had the sand covering the statue
removed and soon afterward he became pharoah.
   Restoration work on the statue also was done during the
Greco-Roman era 16 centuries ago, and by enthusiastic foreign
Egyptologists in the early 20th century. Officials of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization pitched in between 1982 and 1987.
   Close-up, the proud-looking statue is a patchwork of the results
of the various restoration operations. The Greco-Roman and early
20th century attempts involved giving the vulnerable parts of the
statue a second protective skin of limestone.
   The restoration that ended last year included giving the Sphinx
a 10-inch thick coat of limestones, using cement and gypsum to
stick them together.
   It is this last operation that Hawass and other Egyptologists
have attacked, saying the cement and gypsum did not allow the
limestone to breath. Another problem, they said, was a rising water
table that caused salts to weaken the limestone structure.
   ``It was a very bad restoration project,'' said Hawass. ``We
have to remove this layer, but when we tried that, we found that it
will hurt the original body of the Sphinx. So now we do not know
what to do.''
   He said that Egyptologists and scientists were trying to develop
a chemical mixture to serve as mortar to hold the stones together
while allowing them to breathe.
   Hawass stressed that no damaging cement or gypsum were used in
Tuesday's restoration. The stones will be held in place with a wall
of dovetailed pieces of limestone.

   ``Pyramid,'' a PBS special on Monday night, is
about some world-famous monuments dedicated to the notion that you
CAN take it with you.
   Based on David Macaulay's 1975 book, ``Pyramid'' combines
location shots of some of Egypt's greatest wonders with an animated
cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues
and speculation on how the tombs were built, some of them more than
4,000 years ago.
   The show clearly explains the details of construction, although
plot twists in the animation, a kind of ``docudrama'' historical
cartoon strip, tend to get a little too convoluted.
   From 3,000 to 1,100 B.C., Egypt was ruled by kings called
pharaohs. The Egyptians believed that when pharaohs died they became
gods, so their tombs were the largest and most elaborate of all.
   The ancient Egyptians also considered death the beginning of a
new life in another world. This life would last forever, they
believed, if certain precautions were taken, including preserving
corpses by mummification.
   A pyramid's burial chamber held the mummy and all the objects,
actual and symbolic, that would help the person's spirit, known as
the ka, survive in the afterlife.
   ``One of the reasons we have such a rich legacy of artifacts and
information, much of it about everyday life, is that much of it was
entombed for use in the next world,'' said Macaulay, who has
published 14 other books, including his latest, ``The Way Things
Work.''
   The show includes a visit to a museum with an exhibit of a
replica taken from a pyramid of an Egyptian cattle dealer. He
``wanted to take his business with him,'' said Macaulay, who serves
as the show's host and guide, ``and so he did _ in a model. He even
had some accountants in the model to make sure he wasn't
shortchanged.
   ``The models were as important as real life. They were the real
thing; they weren't just models in the minds of the Egyptians,''
Macaulay said in an interview.
   Macaulay spent several weeks on location in February 1986. ``We
were given access to all sorts of things that people are not
normally given access to,'' he said. ``We had, for instance, the
Cairo museum to ourselves for three nights running.''
   The film goes beyond the book by showing the urban sprawl that is
encroaching on the historical sites. There are, for example, some
glimpses of pyramids near modern residential neighborhoods of Giza,
a suburb of Cairo.
   ``You can get shots of them from the desert side, and it looks
like there's nothing around them. But if you shoot them from the
building side, you end up with little buildings that are five or six
stories high in front of these pyramids and for the first time you
really get a sense of the scale of these pyramids.''
   The great pyramid at Giza is 481 feet high or about the size of a
40-story office building. It was built with more than 2 million
blocks of stone, some weighing 15 tons, and covers the equivalent of
seven square blocks of midtown Manhattan. It stretches 755 feet on
each of its four sides and is so close to geometric perfection that
the difference between the longest and shortest side is only 7
inches.
   In the book, the pyramid and complex of surrounding temples and
tombs are imaginary. They are, however, based closely on several of
the pyramids and temples still standing in Egypt.
   The show's script was written by Marc Olshaker, who also was
producer, in cooperation with Macaulay and a group of five
Egyptologists from the United States and Egypt.
   ``Pyramid'' is the third PBS production by Unicorn Projects,
which also did specials on two previous Macaulay books,
``Cathedral'' in 1986 and ``Castle'' in 1983.

   He was an ancient Egyptian turncoat,
backbone of the pharaoh's government one day and strong right arm
of the conquering Persians the next.
   Most of what the world knows of Udjahorresnet comes from
inscriptions on his statue in the Vatican collection, which boast
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him.
   But it's a tale without an end _ the finale missing, the last
lines obscured.
   Now, in the depths of a desert burial maze, Czechoslavak
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic
Egypt's dastardly personalities.
   Almost 60 feet down, at the foot of a central shaft cut through
soft petrified clay and filled with sand, the team discovered a
burial chamber.
   ``What a shock to see his name, Udjahorresnet, in such an
unexpected place, away from his home'' in the Nile delta, ``away
from his Persian connections,'' said Miroslav Verner, head of
Egyptology at Charles University in Prague.
   ``It was thrilling,'' Verner said. ``His name is what all
Egyptologists learn first when they study the Persian takeover of
Egypt. ... He was a dark personage, a man known for his betrayal.''
   Verner has been field director since 1976 of a Czechoslavak
archaeological mission in Abusir, an ancient burial and religious
center 18 miles southwest of Cairo.
   Mission scientists discovered a series of rubble-filled shafts
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid
ruin. Verner's 10-man team and colleagues from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization began excavating last November.
   Udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death. The
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in Egypt.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
Persia conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.
   Little is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, Cambyses' son, put down internal
strife,'' Verner said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but Verner said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the 1960s, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza
Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ Egypt's chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' Verner said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after Egypt's defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in Egypt, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the Vatican collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left Egypt with the Roman Emperor Hadrian early in
the second century.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at Tivoli near Rome.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, Verner said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. Verner said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.

repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in Egypt.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
Persia conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.
   Little is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, Cambyses' son, put down internal
strife,'' Verner said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but Verner said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the 1960s, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza
Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ Egypt's chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' Verner said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after Egypt's defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in Egypt, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the Vatican collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left Egypt with the Roman Emperor Hadrian early in
the second century.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at Tivoli near Rome.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, Verner said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. Verner said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.

<HEAD>Antiquities Director Dies of Heart Attack at 54</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's chief archaeologist
and chairman of antiquities, has died of a heart attack at age 54,
friends and newspapers reported Friday.
   Tawfik, a former dean of archaeology and professor of Egyptology
at Cairo University, was the author of a half-dozen books on
Egyptian antiquities.
   As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, he was in
charge of all restoration and conservation work on Egypt's vast
legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by
time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.
   But among Egyptologists, Tawfik is remembered most as an
excavator, especially for his work on a windblown bluff overlooking
the ancient royal burial grounds of Sakkara south of Cairo.
   He began the excavation eight years ago. In 1985 he uncovered an
unknown burial ground from the time of Pharaoh Ramses II, tombs
hidden 33 feet below the desolate hillside that yielded a rich
store of data about some of the most important officials of the
Egypt of 3,250 years ago.
   Friends said Tawfik was at Sakkara on Thursday. That night he
suffered a heart attack and died instantly.He was buried on Friday.
   Tawfik spoke of his love for Egyptology and excavation in an
interview on Tuesday, his last.
   ``Each time I excavate, I'm rewriting history,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``Imagine that before I began the dig in Sakkara,
we never knew Ramses II had a history there. History is a puzzle,
and I'm helping to write new chapters.''
   Tawfik became chairman of antiquities in December 1988 after a
10-month battle over who or what caused a boulder to fall from the
shoulder of the Sphinx, which cost Tawfik's predecessor his job.
   Widespread concern persists over the future of the half-man,
half-beast statue at the foot of Giza Plateau.
   But Tawfik remained optimistic to the end that the Sphinx would
survive. He made weekly visits, including one Tuesday morning.
   ``I think the restoration work going on at the Sphinx is
wonderful. I'm so happy with it,'' he said.
   ``Some weeks I go once to the Sphinx, sometimes three times. If
I don't go to make sure everything is going well, the Sphinx might
sleep. And one day I'll go and it'll be gone. I must be vigilant,
fight to save the Sphinx.''
   Despite his workload, Tawfik refused to abandon his love for
excavation.
   ``Excavation is life, and what's so wonderful is each time you
go down, you are a discoverer,'' he said Tuesday.
   Survivors include Tawfik's German-born widow, Frieda; his son
Tarek, an Egyptology student at Cairo University; and daughter,
Sophie, a pupil at a German school in Cairo.

   Tourists can still see the subtle
smile but little else of the Sphinx, the half man, half beast
crouched in the desert sands guarding the pyramids.
   The smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected to
envelop the chest of the ailing 4,600-year-old statue as Egyptian
authorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one of
the world's best-known monuments.
   The effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbaned
workers prying rocks from his massive paws, sticking sensors into
his backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle.
   Scaffolding first appeared at the Sphinx's right shoulder in the
spring of 1988, shortly after a rock broke off and tumbled to the
ground. More weak spots were discovered, and now the framework is
being extended across the famous frontal view.
   Prime Minister Atef Sedki of Egypt made an official inspection
visit, seeking to determine whether restoration begun in 1982,
which covered the front paws and other portions with concrete
blocks, helped or harmed the Sphinx.
   ``There's no threat to the Sphinx,'' Sedki said after the visit.
But he added: ``Although I'm not a technical man, I can see with my
eyes that former restoration work was wrong.
   ``The government will not deny any financial support that the
new restoration work requires. The important thing is to save the
statue that symbolizes the Egyptian civilization.''
   Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization,
said the latest effort calls for removing all large restoration
stones attached since 1982.
   Restoration was being done on the Sphinx at least 3,000 years
ago. But Tawfik, climbing atop the front paws, said a key
difference in the current project is that for the first time,
restorers will try to ensure that the repaired Sphinx looks like
the Sphinx.
   Earlier restorations in the 1980s, he said, simply coated
endangered areas without regard to the shape the ancients carved.
   ``There's a 10-centimeter (four-inch) difference in the original
shape of the paws and in restoration stones that cover them,''
Tawfik said. ``You can't even imagine how the Sphinx should look. ''
   He said the Egyptian-born artist and sculptor Adam Henein has
been brought from Paris to help restore the body to its original
form.
   ``We're studying hundreds of pictures taken since the middle of
the last century, even when it was almost totally buried, for clues
to how the Sphinx looked,'' he said.
   Concrete blocks have been numbered and are being carried from
the site as smaller replacement stones from the Giza Plateau are
installed. Greeks and Romans restoring the monument more than 2,000
years ago also used small blocks, and Tawfik said their work is
better than any by modern restorers.
   ``Restoration begun in 1982 proved awfully bad because large
stones were used that completely damaged the Sphinx,'' said Zahi
Hawass, director of the pyramids area.
   ``Also, they used cement and gypsum, so now not only are we
looking at bad rock that has always been in the Sphinx but also at
rock that's been damaged from bad restoration.''
   Criticism of the 1980s restoration has been common for years and
the Sphinx has become a political issue as well as a scientific one.
   The latest controversy began in mid-November with stories in
newspapers speculating that mischief felled the chunk of stone from
the Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb. 7, 1988.
   Tawfik and other experts responded by saying scientists studied
the rockfall for a year before deciding it occurred in a section of
limestone weakened by salt, wind and other natural phenomena. The
dispute raged for weeks.
   The Sphinx is likely to have little peace for quite a while.
   ``The Sphinx is like Lebanon, with militias tearing at each
other,'' said Omar el-Arini, a member of the antiquities
organization's scientific committee and a science officer at the
U.S. Embassy.
   ``He's a 50-million-year-old man, because that's how old the
rock is. How do you restore him? Do you rejuvenate him? Do you
treat his ailments?
   ``What's missing here is a general plan.''

<DATELINE>MIT RAHINA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finding a new home isn't easy if you're
30 feet tall and weigh 50 tons. But if your name is Ramses the
Great, welcome mats come out all over.
   The question for Egyptian antiquities officials was which mat to
choose and they now have decided the proper thing would be to bring
Ramses back home from Cairo to this quiet village on the edge of the
desert, known in Ramses' time as Memphis.
   The rose granite colossus of the warrior Pharaoh Ramses II, who
reigned in 1292-1225 B.C., was taken from Mit Rahina in 1954 to a
platform in front of Cairo's bustling central railway depot on
orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had taken power in a coup two
years before.
   That decision proved a headache for the officials, however. They
worried that exhaust fumes from heavy motor vehicle traffic would
cause the statue to crumble and that the vibration from railroad and
subway trains beneath it would cause it to crack.
   In the late 1980s talk turned to saving it. One suggestion was to
move Ramses to the Giza Pyramids and another was to put him on an
artificial island in the Nile.
   In early June, however, a different course was decided.
   ``We decided to take him home, back where we got him,'' said
Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   When Ramses left Mit Rahina for the square renamed for him, Cairo
was a city of tree-lined boulevards. Today it's a megacity of 12
million people and growing.
   ``Poor Ramses,'' Egyptologist Gamal Mokhtar, a former chairman of
the antiquities organization, said in Cairo.
   ``He was brought here at the request of ... President Nasser, who
had overthrown the monarchy and wanted a symbol of ancient Egyptian
power. Nobody questioned it. You didn't at that time. Nobody thought
whether being in the city center was good for the statue. It isn't.''
   Nasser died in 1970.
   The statue has to be moved not only for its safety but also the
Pharaoh's dignity, Mokhtar said.
   ``Such statues never belonged in a public square,'' he said.
``They belonged in temples, facing the people, as a warning and
reminder of the Pharaoh's might.
   ``When you come into Cairo from the north, you see Ramses'
backside. That was never meant to be on public view. For one of
Egypt's greatest Pharaohs, this isn't proper.''
   Mit Rahina is a fitting place for Ramses. It is rimmed with date
palms and swaying halfa grass, which, when it was called Memphis,
brought fear and dread to adversaries throughout the ancient world.
Memphis was Egypt's first true capital and later its military
headquarters.
   Ramses II brought great power and wealth to Egypt. He built more
buildings and more colossal statues than any other Pharaoh.
   He had other capitals, but Ramses had special affection for
Memphis, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis is thought to have begun
life as no more than a tiny fortress beside the Nile, protected by a
white wall. In its heyday it stretched for miles and incorporated
military barracks, temples, palaces, shipyards, weapons factories
and craftshops.
   Its cemeteries extended for 50 miles and included the Giza
Plateau, home of the pyramids. Historians record that its Temple of
Ptah, the creator god and Memphis' patron, was a third of a mile
long and a quarter-mile wide and fronted by monumental statues of
Ramses.
   How many colossi of Ramses graced Memphis is not known, but
records say at least 15 were at the Ptah temple alone. A fallen
statue that would have stood about 45 feet, with fingernails the
size of hands, lies toppled on its back.
   A third colossus is the centerpiece of the Ramses exhibit now in
Dallas, Texas, at the end of a tour of the United States.
   Pieces of other statues lie among ancient Memphis' ruins, red
granite torsos and heads mingled haphazardly with weeds. Some are
covered with dirt for protection from village children, who use the
ruins for playgrounds.
   For part of the year the sacred texts, column bases and statues
are trapped in marshes, salty water rising as high as 6{ feet,
soaking and decaying all in its path.
   Tawfik said he believes the return of Ramses will mark a new
beginning for the ancient city.
   ``When visitors come to Mit Rahina, they stay only 30 minutes or
so, just enough to see the fallen Ramses and the monuments on
display,'' he said. ``We want to provide enough to keep them here
all day.''
   He said Memphis suffered because it was too important for too
long. Lived in for 1,700 years by Ramses' time, the city was built
largely of perishable mud-brick. Generations built on the fallen
mud-brick houses of their forbears so that ``what we have now are
ruins, not a complete city,'' Tawfik said.
   Except for the remnants of the once-magnificent temples, little
of old Memphis remains in Mit Rahina.
   ``The ancient Egyptian ... was mainly interested in the
netherworld, the afterlife. This is where he put his major
efforts,'' Tawfik said. ``This is why we have left so many examples
of monuments for eternity but not so many for life.''

BEJART PYRAMID SCHEME COLLAPSES IN FISCAL FLOP; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: EGYPT'S ATTEMPTS TO BOOST TOURIST REVENUES USING THE ARTS FAIL AGAIN.

Choreographer Maurice Bejart stood at the Pyramids and imagined a tableau of 
dancers swooning to the rhythms of the East, framed only by the starry night 
sky, the tombs of ancient kings and, like an eerie, whirling backdrop, the 
Egyptian desert. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Switzerland, he set about creating a mystic, sensual ballet to 
give movement to the splendor of ancient Egypt and the modern Islamic faith. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian promoter Michel Reculez contracted with an Egyptian company to 
construct the stage. Costumes and set backdrops were flown in. Sophisticated 
new lighting equipment was leased. Tickets were sold to travelers from all over 
Europe for what was to be one of the cultural events of the decade here: the 
premiere of Bejart's "Pyramid" on the Pyramids Plateau of Giza. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians had visions of their own, however: Customs wanted a 20% duty on 
the imported equipment. Tax authorities wanted $50,000 for each of the eight 
scheduled performances as an advance. The antiquities organization wanted 
royalties of $3,800 per performance, plus another $11,300 deposit, and demanded 
150 free tickets each night. Then, two days before last month's premiere, the 
contractor announced the price for building the stage was not $211,000, as 
promoter Reculez believed, but $566,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the subsequent dispute, 200 police officers blocked access to the site and 
the performance was called off. 
</P>
<P>
Reculez flew back to Brussels and declared bankruptcy. A visibly shaken Bejart 
announced that the ballet would go on, but only at Cairo's downtown opera 
house, not at the Pyramids. Angry ticket-holders unsuccessfully demanded their 
money back. The lighting company directors hired an Egyptian lawyer to try to 
get their $600,000 worth of equipment out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Kafka -- no, it's worse than Kafka. It's state robbery," declared 
one Belgian government official who tried to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The fiasco was but the latest setback in Egypt's attempts to capitalize on its 
legendary archaeological treasures as modern cultural institutions. Seeking to 
boost tourist revenues and bring new life to the ancient monuments, Egyptian 
promoters have sponsored concerts at the Pyramids and lavish productions of the 
opera "Aida" at Luxor and Giza, and they have attempted to organize a music 
festival at temples up and down the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
Although the events have been enthusiastically received in the arts community, 
most have been fiscal flops, resulting in months of finger-pointing, lawsuits 
and recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is a great lure, but we've had so many of these disasters," complained 
Magda Saleh, former director of Cairo's opera house. "The government is 
behaving as if, no matter what happens, we want our pound of flesh. Well, they 
got their pound of flesh, but the (promoter), for whatever reason, got ruined. 
. . . There's quite a history of this sort of thing, and it's a pity. It's like 
killing the goose that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
Well-known Egyptian opera singer Hassan Kamy, who produced "Aida" at the 
Pyramids in 1987, complained in a special column: "It is obvious now that we 
will never be capable of having such a big cultural event in our beautiful 
country unless we get rid of all this bureaucracy and realize the enormous loss 
we have sustained by killing the Bejart project." 
</P>
<P>
Kamy's interest was rekindled by more than the publicity over the Bejart 
production and by his own memories of haggling with tax and customs officials 
over "Aida," which eventually drew an audience of 27,000. After imposing 
customs duties on the Bejart production, authorities checked their records and 
determined that no similar duties had been assessed to Kamy in 1987. Three 
weeks ago, he got a letter demanding $106,000. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian government officials admit that productions at archaeological sites so 
far have been money losers, but blame the losses on Western producers who don't 
bother to learn how to work the system in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect to do things as they do in Berlin or Frankfurt; they expect 
everything to go a la West, and then they make enormous mistakes," Tarek Ali 
Hassan, current director of the Cairo Opera, complained in an interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I reject out of hand these claims that the system is inefficient, the system 
is unfair. It is not. Somebody has not done their homework properly. A lot of 
planning is needed -- a lot of groundwork. As it happens, Westerners are used 
to the normal channels, and the normal channels do not apply here." 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Egyptian arts community privately say that Reculez, a travel 
company owner with no previous experience producing a major cultural event, 
should have familiarized himself better with the Egyptian bureaucracy before 
launching so large an undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
But Reculez says he could not have anticipated the last-minute demand by the 
contractor building the stage that effectively tripled the price. The 
contractor, who has declined interviews, has told the Egyptian courts that he 
had informed Reculez from the beginning that the price was to be charged in 
dollars, not Egyptian pounds -- and thus Reculez should have anticipated the 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was further complicated when the subcontractor supplying the wood 
for the stage suddenly demanded an extra $350,000 in case it was decided to 
make the stage permanent rather than dismantle it after the performance. 
Reculez put up a check to cover the demand as a deposit, pending resolution of 
the dispute after the performances. The contractor attempted to cash it, and 
when it bounced, the Egyptian authorities seized not only the theater, but also 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of leased electronic equipment that 
was already installed. 
</P>
<P>
Reculez, his own house in Brussels mortgaged to cover the advance costs, went 
home having spent $500,000, without a cent of revenue to show for it. Bejart's 
Ballet Lausanne performed at the opera house free of charge -- confident, 
perhaps, that the production will earn money later at European performances. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost everything," Reculez said in an interview. "It's a very big scandal, 
you know. The problem in Egypt is that nothing is easy. Nothing, nothing, 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, you receive with a smile all authorization. 'Yes, come, come.' After 
that, everybody -- everybody -- asks to be paid. In advance. For tax. For 
customs. For everything you have to pay in advance, and when there is a 
problem, you don't find anyone able to find a solution. You find nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Bejart, meanwhile, has declined to comment publicly on the matter, calling it a 
business dispute between the promoter and the contractor. At a news conference 
last week, he said he was glad at least to be able to open the production at 
the opera house. 
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose was to give an Egyptian performance to the Egyptian public, 
and we find a lot of the possibilities to make (it happen)," he said. "We want 
to give our view of this wonderful civilization, to give it to the world, and 
mainly to the Egyptians." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't like to lose. So maybe I lose the Pyramids, I lose the 
desert, I lose everything, but the public's not going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
But Kamy said Bejart privately was "in deep pain," and Kamy himself refused to 
attend any of the seven performances at the opera, which concluded last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one-third of something is better than three-thirds of nothing," he 
said. "But as an artist, I feel wounded like him. I see what's in his face, I 
hear his voice. I did not go. I did not want to see it. I did not want to see 
one-third of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
Though the government remains committed to producing cultural events at Egypt's 
historic sites, Hassan said, the Bejart performance was a success even within 
the confines of the opera house -- in part, he said, because it was among the 
first theatrical works produced in Cairo that forced Egyptians to examine and 
question their identity as the heirs of both Ramses and Mohammed, Napoleon and 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after the performances, columnists began asking about Bejart's 
mystic view of Islam and wondering whether it did not lean more toward his own 
Shiism, rather than the Sunni Islam that most Egyptians adhere to. Some 
criticized his depiction of the beloved Egyptian diva, Om Koulthoum, as 
"grotesque." But despite scanty costumes and veiled Muslim women in punk 
sunglasses, there were none of the usual complaints from Islamic fundamentalist 
quarters that frequently occur at Egyptian cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is this production, with its richness and its greatness, has 
set a lot of people thinking -- it has created healthy controversies," Hassan 
said. "People were transformed, as if by magic, when they left. People that 
don't know each other were talking to each other, people were set wondering, 
questioning. This, I think, was one of the greatest gains of the experience, 
whatever else happened."

   The National Geographic Society released
pictures today of an Egyptian boat photographed with special
equipment in a stone chamber where the royal vessel was entombed
beside the Great Pyramid of Khufu 4,600 years ago.
   National Geographic officials said the photographs were taken
with remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that the
chamber then was sealed, leaving the ancient craft undisturbed in
its resting place.
   A similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in 1954. That
142-foot-long craft was excavated, reassembled and put in a museum
specially constructed for its display. Officials said that boat now
is decaying rapidly.
   But new techniques permitted experts from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization and from the United States to survey the
new boat using remote cameras, the National Geographic announced
today. The boat was documented last October and its chamber then
was sealed with the craft untouched.
   The National Geographic said in a release that a joint
U.S.-Egyptian team of scientists had hoped that the chamber
containing the new boat had remained airtight during the 46
centuries since it was sealed.
   In an effort to capture samples of that air, the scientists used
a drill enclosed in an air lock. An arrangement of vacuum tubes was
used to suck the chamber's air into storage tanks for analysis.
   ``The air in the chamber proved to be moderately polluted urban
air,'' said Pieter Tans, a scientist from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration who analyzed the samples.
   He said this proves that the chamber was not sealed and
possibily never was. Samples of the cap of the chamber, said Tans,
showed that the rock was a light limestone.
   ``The rock was so permiable that this pit probably has never
been sealed,'' he said.
   Remote television pictures taken inside the chamber detected a
beetle, which immediately proved, officials said, that the chamber
had been unsealed for some time.
   Tans said the insect was identified as a common desert beetle
that feeds on fungi that is commonly found in decaying wood.
   Television and still cameras lowered into the drill hole were
able to document the entire interior of the boat chamber. The TV
camera used fiber optics to light the chamber. In this way, the
lights added no heat to tomb environment.
   Photos released by the National Geographic show a mound of cedar
timbers collapsed to the floor of a long chamber that had been cut
with precision out of solid limestone bedrock.
   Scientists studying the pictures have identified various boat
parts, including oar blades, deckhouse and hull planking. There was
no sign of a mast, sail or rigging.
   The video camera detected hieroglyphic markings on the ceiling
of the chamber. The National Geographic interpreted these symbols
as measurements and as the name of the team of workers who carved
the stone used in the chamber.
   The National Geographic announcement said the purposes of the
boat, and of its sister craft excavated in 1954, remain a mystery.
   ``Why did the ancient Egyptians disassemble and bury two
full-size royal ships at the base of the Great Pyramid?'' the
announcement asks.
   The boats are thought to have been entombed to honor the Pharoah
Khufu by his son and successor Djedefre, according to the National
Geographic.
   But it is not known if the boats were used to bring Khufu's body
on the Nile from his palace at Memphis to the pyramid at Giza, or
if the craft were entombed in the belief that Khufu would use them
in an afterlife.
   A report on the exploration of the boat chamber is carried in
the April issue of National Geographic, the monthly magazine of the
National Geographic Society.

   Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah
Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists
who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt
more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born.
   The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French
Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite
de France, the state-owned utility which conducted a high-tech
exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo.
   The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser,
said to be the first stone structure in history, and other
pyramids. The discovery of the queens' tombs brings to 85 the
number of known pyramids in Egypt.
   One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain
subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said
Jacques Montlucon, who led the utility's team.
   In the 19th century, the 50-acre Sakkara site served as a quarry
from which stone was taken for building in Cairo. For the last 25
years or so, extensive digging around the pyramid of Pepi I has
left a field of rubble at the site.
   ``It looks like a battlefield there,'' said Montlucon, adding
that the pyramids were covered by ``eight meters (about 26{ feet)
of rubbish.''
   ``In such disturbed land, it would be practically impossible to
find anything, to know where to begin to dig, without our current
technology,'' he said.
   Last summer Montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts
retrieved from the wreck of the Titanic.
   He said the electromagnetic tests used at Sakkara were developed
by the French utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential
nuclear reactor sites.
   Using test results, the team put together a map pinpointing five
possible pyramid sites. Three sites were then excavated.
   The first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba, or tomb, of
a dynastic official. Weeks passed before workers finally hit the
stone of a pyramid on Feb. 12.
   ``I was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in
shouting `Mabrouk!' (congratulations),'' Montlucon said. ``I felt
so happy I could have cried.''
   Workers dug out a ``buttonhole'' through which they could see a
segment of the pyramid wall, smooth and gold in color. The French
archaeological team will ask permission from the Eygptian
Antiquities Organization to begin full excavation next year on the
pyramid, thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base.
   The find is ``a big gain for Egyptology'' and ``will allow us to
know more, possibly a great deal more, about the 6th Dynasty'' that
ruled the Nile Valley from 2420 to 2258 B.C., Montlucon said.
   Archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic
inscriptions that can be added to the Pyramid Texts, the oldest
writings known to man. The archaeologists also hope the writing
will reveal the name of the pharaoh's wife, shrouded by the
centuries, who is buried there.

   A computerized weather station atop
the Sphinx will begin transmitting data that scientists hope will
help them stop the monument's alarming decay.
   ``The Sphinx has deteriorated more in the last 50 years than in
all previous centuries of its existence combined,'' Sayed Tawfik,
Egypt's chairman of antiquities, said Tuesday.
   The $200,000 solar-powered station was developed by the Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey, Calif., for a project in
China and was adapted for the Sphinx.
   People have worked for thousands of years to keep the
4,600-year-old crouching lion with a pharaoh's face from falling
apart, but nothing has worked for very long.
   Rocks still fall from the structure, located at the base of the
Giza Pyramids. A large stone fell from the great beast's shoulder
in February 1988, provoking an international outcry.
   The massive stone face now is covered with scaffolding. Egyptian
conservationists are removing and replacing blocks already restored
on the right paw and sides, trying to make the Sphinx look like its
old self.
   The 200-pound, 6{ foot-tall weather station, installed Tuesday,
sits piggyback on the Sphinx's back, held in place by sandbags.
   Scientists said the monitor will remain in place for at least a
year, transmitting data to a computer a mile away.
   It will monitor rainfall, wind direction and speed, relative
humidity, pollutants, temperature and the effects of water and salt
on the limestone layers that make up the statue. All are possible
causes of the monument's problems, said Frank Preusser, acting
co-director of the Getty conservation team.
   An adjacent instrument measures solar radiation.
   Preusser said data from the new project should help Egyptian
officials develop a plan to save the Sphinx.
   ``The Sphinx s perhaps the most famed, and by far the most
thoroughly documented and scrutinized, monument of the ancient
world,'' he said. ``There has never been a coordinated effort to
methodically quantify and examine ... factors affecting it.
   ``We can't stop deterioration of any monument in the world, but
there is always a solution to slowing the decay.''
   Tawfik called the Sphinx ``the greatest symbol of our heritage.''

   A British tourist fell to his death after he
illegally climbed the Great Pyramid, then dozed off, authorities
said Monday.
   Peter Harold Flanagan apparently climbed the 482-foot pyramid
Saturday night, a British Embassy spokesman said. His body was
found Sunday beside the monument, the largest of the three Giza
pyramids, said John Hillman, an embassy official.
   An officer at Giza police station said Flanagan apparently was
alone on his climb and that foul play was not suspected. He did not
explain how authorities knew Flanagan, 21, fell asleep before
toppling to his death.
   Pyramid climbing has been done for centuries. Records show more
than 1,600 climbers have died in the past 200 years, and at least
200 of them in the last 50 years.
   The last reported death was in 1980 when Susanne Urban, a
21-year-old American, was killed in a fall.
   Pyramid climbing was banned in 1951 but enforcement has been lax.

<HEAD>Suspended Animation Charting New Medical Frontiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To save Ethel St. Lawrence from the aneurysm
pressing on her brain, doctors ``killed'' her for 40 minutes. They
put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and
drained her body of blood.
   St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls ``a
cotton-pickin' miracle,'' a sort of suspended animation that lets
surgeons cure hard-to-reach, high-risk aneurysms that once were
considered inoperable.
   ``It is everything that technology can possibly offer,'' said
her neurosurgeon, Dr. Robert Spetzler at Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix.
   ``It may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding
poses the greatest risk to the operation,'' said Dr. Julian E.
Bailes, a neurosurgeon at Allegheny General Hospital here who
studied with Spetzler. ``That's the biggest cause of death in
surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended
animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field.''
   In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived
of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the
aneurysm _ a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood
vessel _ and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive
bleeding and certain death.
   Of 15 patients who have undergone the procedure at Barrow, only
one has died, Bailes said. Most had ``excellent'' results, a few
reported some weakness but otherwise did well, and most remained in
a coma no more than five days.
   But the risks, including that the heart won't restart, are too
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately
do the job.
   And because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical
death for the operation to succeed, doctors approach it with ``a
lot of respect,'' said Dr. Steven Shedd, a Barrow
neuroanesthesiologist who worked on St. Lawrence.
   St. Lawrence, a 61-year-old Phoenix secretary, had surgery June
6. She now needs no medication and the severe headaches are gone,
though she still is unable to fully open her eye.
   Cecilia Duffy, a 76-year-old Pittsburgh woman, hasn't come out
of the coma induced Aug. 31 to remove an aneurysm. Her brain
activity is improving, there is no evidence of brain injury, and
she moves her legs when stimulated, but doctors don't know why she
doesn't wake up.

<HEAD>Augustine Research May Provide Valuable Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTINE VOLCANO, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working from a plywood shack
and tents perched on the flank of Augustine Volcano, researchers
are setting up a high-tech system to measure the volcano's shudders
to within an inch.
   When they're done, scientists using briefcase-sized laser
instruments ``could detect less than that, but it's a matter of
whether you believe it,'' says Gene Iwatsubo of the U.S. Geological
Survey, one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano
works and whether its eruptions can be predicted.
   ``The thrust of the research is to try to find precursors, signs
of eruption,'' says Juergen Kienle, a University of Alaska
geophysics professor. ``The more precursors you have, the better
off you are.''
   Augustine Volcano juts 4,000 feet out of Kamishak Bay on the
west side of Cook Inlet. It appears benign but there have been six
major eruptions since its discovery in 1778. One, in 1883,
triggered a 30-foot wave that destroyed houses and boats at Port
Graham, nearly 50 miles away.
   Computer models show a slide-generated tsunami would reach
Homer, a Kachemak Bay fishing community of 4,000 people about 70
miles away, in about an hour. A smaller wave would reach Anchorage,
175 miles away, three hours later.
   Information that may enable scientists to predict eruptions
accurately at Augustine may be of great value to other parts of the
world where millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes _
or on them.
   Four seismographs ring the volcano at an elevation of about
1,000 feet and two are near the peak. Three sets of tiltmeters
measure changes in the surface.

<HEAD>Restorers Tackle Massive Great Pyramid for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said Zahi Hawass, Egyptian
Antiquities Organization director-general for the pyramids area.
``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize the outer
stones, there could be a tragedy.''
   Work began inside the Great Pyramid last winter to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone onto inside walls. The outside
work began last month.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In 1976, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, Hawass said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with Cheops Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.

'GRUEL WITH A KICK': ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BREWERY IS UNTAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a long day of slaving over the pottery kilns or digging tombs, the 
ancient Egyptians probably looked forward to knocking back a few jars of the 
local beverage. 
</P>
<P>
Some undoubtedly quaffed the product from what archeologists believe may be the 
oldest brewery in the world -- a recently unearthed four-vat operation capable 
of producing a dung-fired beer brewed from Nile water, half-baked bread, wheat 
malt and date juice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm describing the beer as gruel with a kick," said Jeremy Geller, an 
archeologist in the anthropology department at Washington University in St. 
Louis. Geller is excavating the brewery in the ancient city of Hierakonpolis on 
the banks of the Nile about 450 miles south of Cairo. By examining pottery 
shards at the site and assessing a radiocarbon analysis of a mysterious black 
residue found in the vats, Geller estimates that the brewery was active about 
5,400 years ago, before the rise of the Pharaohs and construction of the 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
"If his dates hold up, it sounds like the oldest brewery in the world," said 
Solomon Katz, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes 
a robust thirst for beer was one of the main reasons prehistoric 
hunter-gatherers banded together to create civilizations and develop 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Geller initially was interested in studying the pottery industry that 
flourished along the Nile about 3,400 years before the time of Jesus Christ. On 
the floor of the desert, in what was once the industrial sector of 
Hierakonpolis, Geller noticed chunks of burned clay pots and the broken lip of 
a large vessel. But the pottery kiln was unlike any Geller had ever 
encountered. 
</P>
<P>
Geller found four upright conical vats sitting on a raised platform. There was 
evidence that the vats were slowly heated with fires stoked with acacia and 
tamarisk wood and dung. Most intriguing was the presence of a glossy black 
residue that clung to the insides of the vats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Direction 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly not the kiln I had been seeking. But if this was not a 
pottery kiln, what was it? Suddenly I realized that my doctoral research had, 
unexpectedly, taken a new direction," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
An extract of the iridescent gunk was prepared and produced an odor that 
smelled like brandy. Closer examination by botanist Nabil el Hadidi of Cairo 
University revealed that the residue was the prehistoric dregs of a beer made 
with wheat and enriched with a sugary substance. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized we had cereal and sugar in the same vat, we knew it had to be 
beer," said Michael Allen Hoffman, an archeologist at the University of South 
Carolina's Earth Sciences and Resources Institute and director of the 
Hierakonpolis Expedition, the organization that supports the work of Hoffman 
and Geller. 
</P>
<P>
The prehistoric Egyptians of Hierakonpolis probably brewed beer by adding 
broken-up pieces of half-baked bread to water, wheat and a syrup that might be 
date juice. The lightly baked loaves of bread contained the airborne yeast that 
drove the fermentation. The sugar also helped speed the process. Geller 
suggests that final product was frothy gruel that packed a wallop. 
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptians certainly weren't prudes. We're not talking about Nero and 
vulgar excess, but neither are we talking about a real sober people. There was 
clearly a place in ancient Egypt for dance, joy and a little indulgence in beer 
and, later, wine," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
Beer was an important part of Egyptian life. It was drunk by laborers and 
nobles alike. Beer was also placed in tombs to provide the dead with something 
to sip while they pondered eternity. Funeral prayers invoked visions of a 
pleasant afterlife that included "bread and beer, beef and fowl, alabaster and 
linen, and all things good." Tomb walls dating back to the period of Pyramids 
of Giza show recipes for beer. 
</P>
<P>
When the brewery was active, Hierakonpolis was a city of several thousand 
inhabitants. A center of power in the upper Nile, Hierakonpolis supported a 
large pottery industry, herds of sheep and goats and a burgeoning funeral 
business.

<DATELINE>VALLEY OF THE QUEENS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the Queens.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   LeBlanc said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because Hathor's realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the West Bank across the Nile from present-day Luxor.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the Valley of the Kings. Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
   That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the
Kings. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the West Bank. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the Queens, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the Valley of the Kings.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' LeBlanc said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of Ramses II's powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
Nefret, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, Leblanc said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens.
It was Schiaparelli, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.

I HAD done what visitors to Cairo do. I had made a camel circuit of Cheop's
pyramid at Giza, trudged the gloomy halls of the Egyptian Museum, and bought
a Nefertiti bust in a pavement bazaar. I had even visited Dr Raghab's
Floating Papyrus Museum on the banks of the Nile and seen paper being made
as it was 3,000 years ago. But still I was not happy.
The problem was that everything I was seeing and doing revolved around the
ancient past. In my Blue Guide to Egypt, there were over 700 pages crammed
with facts and speculation about the past, but barely two words about life
in our own times. The attitude that what is very dead and very old is worth
a visit is fine for the Valley of the Kings, where residents were
eviscerated and embalmed several thousand years ago. But the residents of
today's Cairo are very much alive and kicking.
Stand on any street corner in the city and you can hardly doubt it. The
crowds are overwhelming, the traffic appalling, the din ferocious. Equipped
to handle a population a fifth of its size, Cairo is bursting at the seams.
Its telephones are crotchety, its power supply whimsical, its plumbing
capricious. Like the donkeys that pull its battered rubbish carts, it
hobbles along looking barely capable of fulfilling its duties.
Nonetheless, it does just that. It remains one of the world's great cities,
a vibrant, vital place. Burying my Blue Guide at the bottom of my suitcase,
I set out to meet some Caireans who could put the more recent past, present
and even the future into some sort of perspective.
* * * VICTOR Simaika may be old, but he is at some remove from the mummy's
tomb. On the morning I met him, a delightful and dapper 87-year-old
gentleman in elegant attire, he apologised for being a few minutes late. He
had, he said, been dancing until 3am, and felt a lie-in not amiss.
On the balcony of his Garden City flat we had tea and spooned thick-cut
English marmalade on to buttered toast. Which, I asked him, looking across
the Nile, was the liveliest part of the city? 'As far as I am concerned,' he
replied, 'it is on my walls.'
And so it was. In the lounge inside, amid mounted antelope heads, riding
trophies, polo match cups, rhino horns and paintings of favourite horses,
were framed photos of a life of social privilege and ease in Cairo that has
ceased to exist. Born into the Egyptian upper classes, educated in Paris and
London when he was not too busy dancing, Victor has pursued the life of a
sportsman, playboy and aristocrat with limitless style and energy.
Pointing to a photo of King Farouk presenting him with a trophy while the
Shah of Iran looks admiringly on, Victor told me of the great love of his
life, polo. He began playing in the 1920s, when British cavalry regiments
were still stationed in Egypt under the occupation. Victor remembers
afternoons at the Gezira Sporting Club when 300 polo ponies would be
gathered round the thundering fields, their Nubian grooms, in regimental
colours, sporting turbans with tails that hung to the ground. Few could
resist such a spectacle, least of all young, moneyed modern Egyptians like
himself looking for change.
He found it, perhaps too much of it. Until then the vast majority of
Egyptians lived on the land, Cairo was a city of less than 1m, and the
dislocations of Nasser's socialist revolution were undreamed of. Not even
tourism resembled today's mass affair. Only wealthy foreigners came to
Egypt, and they did so with an entourage of servants for the winter season.
On one occasion Victor accompanied a party in dinner jackets and evening
dresses across the desert, on donkeyback, to dine at the camp where the
British Egyptologist, Howard Carter, had recently discovered Tutankamun's
tomb. On another, he spent two months cruising the Nile on a private yacht
with Barbara Hutton, an experience he is not yet entirely over. How, he
asked me, could anyone today hope to sample the pleasures of Egypt on
three-day Nile excursions run by games hostesses? Some things, quite
evidently, can never be improved on.
* * * IF VICTOR is a voice from a Cairo that has disappeared, Adel Sabeth
is, in his own eccentric fashion, very much of the present. I met him in his
home, a crumbling, chaotically-kept 19th century pile surrounded by swirling
traffic. Sitting among a great shambles of books, crumpled sheets of paper
and unwashed coffee cups, he was covered in glue, the result of editing and
pasting television scripts.
For even its humblest inhabitant, Cairo is a political town. Politics
occupies roughly the same niche as football and the weather do in English
conversation. Adel has made a profession out of political debate. An
intellectual and writer, he has ridden out the wildest storms of Egyptian
politics close to their centre, writing books defending King Farouk - a
family relative - and condemning 30 years of state economic control. It has
not made him popular in all circles.
Today he is both enthusiastic and critical. Cairo for him is more than ever
the capital of the Arab world, a dynamic centre of commerce, culture,
politics and diplomacy whose influence spreads across the entire Middle
East. But while Cairo's role is pivotal, its civic competence is often
marginal; management, over-bureaucratisation and lack of incentive, all
hangovers from the Nasser era, prevent the development of a political
culture willing to seek solutions to Egypt's formidable problems.
And Egypt's problems are Cairo's problems. With only 4 per cent of its
territory arable, and the national population growing by 1m every eight
months, the capital is a target for large-scale rural migration. Over a
third of Egypt's 51m people are now estimated to be living in Cairo. With
them they have brought all the problems of supplying a largely illiterate
and unskilled population with food, education, housing and jobs. Most remain
unsolved.
Why, I asked Adel as he wiped a gluey knife on the kitchen tablecloth, were
Caireans not then rushing to the barricades? 'We are generally a tolerant,
moderate, and good-humoured people,' he replied. In addition, he reminded
me, Egyptians have for millennia lived in a paternalistic system. From the
start they were administered by a vast bureaucracy that controlled the
essential element of life, Nile irrigation. They were ruled by a living
deity, the pharaoh. In such a state, obsequiousness towards superiors and
fatalism towards life became daily habits. Even after 5,000 years, even
after the collapse of Nasser's revolution of state rule, these habits still
haunt Egypt.
'But we are a clever, enterprising people, despite everything,' said Adel as
I bid him farewell and shook his sticky hand. 'Go out into the streets and
you will see.'
* * * ADEL WAS right. In the narrow, tourist-packed warren of alleyways that
make up the vast Khan al-Khalili market, artisans and merchants were making
and selling everything imaginable at a furious pace. Worked brass, ivory,
wood, silver, cloth or copper, it was all being exchanged in great
quantities for thin bits of plastic - for those who accept all major credit
cards, the future holds some promise.
But it is not a future that appeals to those unlikely to get a slice of the
cake. In Fishawi's, a sidewalk cafe in the heart of the market, I met Ali
Darwish, bearded poet, short story writer and Sufi mystic. Here, at crowded
tables where foreign tourists blithely video-film other foreign tourists,
darker concerns bubble under the surface.
Beside Ali sat a co-religionist and healer, an old woman heavily wrapped in
cloth and turban. From time to time a Sufi adept would approach from the
passing crowd and with great ceremony receive from her a laying on of hands
and a blessing.
'Nasira can cure headaches, rheumatism, colds,' said Ali. 'She is a walking
pharmacy.' But Ali was not talking miracles today. Hunched over sweet tea
and glass water pipes, he and his friends were discussing a threat to
Egypt's future, Islamic fundamentalism.
'As a Sufi,' he told me, 'I belive in democratic rule through co-operation
and charity of the heart. I do not believe in rule by clergy. Fundamentalism
is an insecurity, brought on by the failures of the system to provide the
normal things of life. Its grasp is powerful, and growing every day in
Cairo. It makes us all afraid.'
For hours Ali talked in this vein, his hubble-bubble fragrant in air that
turned cool as the night drew on. I, too, was full of reflection. Kings and
shahs and turbans that touched the ground . . . dinner jackets and
Tutankamun . . . fatalism, sycophancy and pharaonic bureaucracies . . . Sufi
healing and rule-by-clergy . . . No matter where one turned in Cairo, all
paths led back to the past, and those things that seemed very old and very
dead lay just under a patina of modernism. Caught in a very modern Cairo
traffic jam on my way home a few minutes later, I began pining for my Blue
Guide once again.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery:
   Out of the Closet: Boston's Art Treasures Seen at Last
   ----
   By Amy Gamerman

<LP>
   Boston -- For more than 4,000 years, King Cheops's feet
were hidden beneath the Great Pyramid at Giza. For the past
77 years, they have languished in the temperature --
and-humidity-controlled storage rooms of the Museum of Fine
Arts here.
   Unearthed in 1913 by a museum expedition party, the
three-inch chunk of calcite is all that remains of one of
three known statues of the pharoah. Long-toed and elegantly
slender, the feet were considered too fragmentary to be
shown.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But after years of obscurity, Cheops's feet have finally
stepped into the limelight, along with five Federal-style
chairs, a fake Fragonard and Emily Babcock Alward's
19-century court gown. They've all been put on show together
after years of being stuck away in the museum's storerooms.
   At a time when some museums, such as New York's
Guggenheim, are selling off the lesser items in their
collections, the MFA has organized a tribute to them --
"Unlocking the Hidden Museum: Riches From the Storerooms." As
with many big museums, the bulk of the museum's more than a
million objects lie in storage. A no-frills affair down to
the museum packing crates that serve as mounts, this
eccentric and engaging show, up till Sept. 9, tries to
explain why.
   The first room is, in effect, a concrete argument for
owning too much of a good thing, but against showing all of
it. To make this point, five near-identical English porcelain
goat-and-bee cream jugs are grouped in one vitrine, not far
from the five Federal-style chairs, four Kashmiri shawls and
70 stone "shawabtis", bearded pharaonic servitors from the
tomb of the Nubian pharoah, Taharqa. Eager to avoid chores in
the after-life, Taharqa was buried with more than 1,000 of
the statues. The museum got to take home half after
excavating his tomb in 1918, adding to a considerable
"shawabti" collection that eventually would total just under
10,000. Though of great interest to scholars, the entire
group has never been displayed. "It might sink the floor,"
one curator remarked.
   In fact, the museum has so many artifacts from the Middle
Eastern digs it sponsored from 1905 to 1942, that less than
10% can be shown at one time. Many of the artifacts have
never been exhibited; more to the point, many still are
packed in their original shipping crates.
   "You don't have to go to Egypt to excavate, you just have
to go into our basement," said Rita Freed, curator of
Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art.
   With such a wealth of objects, a big museum can afford to
be choosy about what it exhibits. So while John Singleton
Copley's portrait of Samuel Adams hangs in public view, his
merely adequate rendering of Robert Hooper Jr. is relegated
to a backroom. Both are on view here, among similar pairings
of the great and not-so-great.
   And so are a few of the museum's mistakes. That Fragonard,
for example, which the museum bought in 1944 only to discover
that it was an 18th-century copy. Shown alongside the real
thing, Fragonard's "The Good Mother" -- borrowed for the show
-- the copy is now a denizen of the storeroom, along with the
fake Roman head and the Egyptian tomb sculpture that turned
out to be a modern forgery cobbled together from ancient
planks of wood.
   The museum keeps its fakes on hand for research purposes,
but occasionally they spring a few surprises of their own.
Thanks to its glossy, unblemished surface, a red-lacquered
Greek vase given to the museum in 1941 was considered a
19th-century forgery. But when a conservator pulled the vase
from a storeroom shelf for this show, he noticed fine
crackles on the surface. X-ray studies revealed that the vase
had been put together from broken fragments and then
over-zealously painted and varnished. Although badly damaged,
it almost certainly dates from the late 5th century B.C. A
small area of the vase has been cleaned of its overpaint, all
of which will be removed after the show.
   Other objects go in and out of storage for reasons that
have more to do with taste than authenticity. Back in 1890,
Henri Regnault's paintings were so admired that the citizens
of Boston took up a subscription to purchase his enormous
"Automedon With the Horses of Achilles." But by 1940, the
10-by-10-foot painting of the nearly nude hero with his
snorting chargers looked dated next to impressionist art.
   M. Regnault's painting has drawn a lot of favorable
attention since emerging from its 20-year stint in the
storeroom, and may eventually return to the gallery. However,
other victims of changing taste, such as Ignacio Zuloaga y
Zabaleta's 1910 "My Uncle Daniel and His Family" -- which
depicts a group of mantilla -- clad, fan-flipping women posed
before a turbid landscape -- seem likely to remain in the
storeroom for a few more decades at least.
   Perhaps the most engrossing section of this show is
devoted to the fragile, the fragmented and the damaged.
Shards of ancient pottery and scraps of thousand-year-old
fabric are important resources for scholars and historians,
but rarely are displayed.
   Other things are kept out of view for their own good.
Edvard Munch's lithograph "The Scream" once was a vivid red.
Now, displayed under the linen flaps that protect it from
further degradation, it is a watery pink from too much
exposure to light and may never be exhibited again.
   Many objects need elaborate and costly restoration before
they can be exhibited. Ironically, this show gave curators
the support to fix some of them up. A tattered 10th-century
Chinese wall screen has been carefully fitted with patches of
new silk, tinted to blend with the original surface. And
conservators spent two years cleaning and resetting more than
10,000 tiny ivory tiles in an 18th-century Indian bookcase.
   Some artifacts wait a century or more for repairs.
Upstairs in an airy conservation studio, Pamela Hatchfield,
one of the show's four curators, is at work on a 3,000
year-old Egyptian coffin that hasn't been treated, much less
exhibited, since it came to the museum in 1872. The coffin
still would be in storage, water-splotched, splintered and
flaking gesso hieroglyphics, if it were not among the more
than 400 objects now being readied for 10-year loans to
museums in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas.
   MFA curators are quick to point to such loans when asked
why storing art isn't the same thing as hoarding it. However,
in the final room of the exhibition that distinction becomes
blurred. Filled with works that MFA curators say are just too
big, too small or too strange to display, it contains
everything from cases of tiny carved netsuke and jewel-like
miniatures, to a Renaissance triptych. Dan Flavin's glaring
light sculpture, "Monument for V. Tatlin" -- isolated here
behind a partition -- isn't shown because its harsh beams
could damage paintings. More to the point, the museum doesn't
have enough 1960s' pop art for a separate gallery. And there
is no textile wing to display the long-trained,
gold-embroidered gown that Mrs. Alward wore to meet Queen
Victoria.
   Eventually, curators say, they hope to have gallery space
for all these objects. But now that museum goers have seen
these treasures, they may not be content to see them return
to storeroom obscurity. Well-meaning curators may have opened
a richly furnished Pandora's box. Writing in the visitors'
comment book, Lisbeth Edgar of Manhattan had one question
that the exhibition failed to answer: "Why are you hogging so
much art?" she demanded.

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BURIAL GROUND IS 'MISUNDERSTOOD AND MISNAMED'

VALLEY OF THE QUEENS, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This quiet, bone-dry ravine of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the 
Valley of the Kings just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery. 
</P>
<P>
And with the mystery, its name. 
</P>
<P>
Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty. To the Arabs it 
was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and guidebooks perpetuate the homage to 
entombed royal women: the Valley of the Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by all 
Egyptologists," said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a continuing 17-year 
French-Egyptian project to record and study its history. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They were here 
first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and named by tradition 
rather than history." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hillsides Scoured 
</P>
<P>
Season after archeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured the sloping, 
dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find the origins of a sequence 
of burials that would last almost 2,000 years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as 
late as the Christian era when Pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over 
and crosses painted on. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of ancient Egypt's 
18th Dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a period of decline, Pharaohs 
and their kin once again lived and died like kings. 
</P>
<P>
That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the 19th Dynasty, 
changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said it is unclear why he did or why the practice continued. In 
addition to queens, royal children still were buried here, and concubines who 
cared for them and Pharaohs' mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women and love, 
emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc said perhaps this 
indicates that religion brought the ancients here, because Hathor's realm also 
included the cemeteries on what is called the West Bank across the Nile from 
present-day Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasure-Filled Tombs 
</P>
<P>
The 18th Dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began, was a time when 
queens traditionally shared their Pharaoh's tombs in the Valley of the Kings. 
Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers were buried there, along with the young 
Pharaoh Tutankhamun, whose treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter 
in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the Kings. Hundreds 
of other royals and officials also were buried on the West Bank. But to the 
world, the glory of the Pharaohs meant the Valley of the Kings -- not the 
Valley of the Queens, the Valley of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles. 
</P>
<P>
For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an afterthought, a place 
to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit to the Valley of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found in the 
limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were working 
tomb-by-tomb," LeBlanc said. "Today, we've uncovered all the major tombs and 
have returned the valley to the way it would have looked when burials began. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we can write its history." 
</P>
<P>
As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the Egyptian Antiquities 
Organization's National Documentation Center, walked through scores of 
excavators digging toward the valley's bedrock. The job at hand was almost 
done, another tomb uncovered from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for 
most of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restoration Work 
</P>
<P>
An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that more can be 
opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now. 
</P>
<P>
The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers of Ramses II's 
powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so deteriorated that they remain 
off-limits. More than half its paintings of the elaborately dressed and 
coiffured queen have been destroyed by natural forces. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been tidbits left by 
workers who built and decorated the tombs. For generations they lived in a 
village inside the valley. Their records, on papyrus, provided the team not 
only with answers but with mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis Nefret, one of Ramses 
II's many wives, and a queen named Duat-Iny-Pet. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but "where are they?" 
</P>
<P>
He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of the queens' 
mummies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is strange," he said. "Did those who came afterwards destroy them?" He 
added that it could mean another royal cache exists, perhaps mummies of queens 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mummified Fetus 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new history for the 
valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the tomb of 9-year-old prince 
Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III. 
</P>
<P>
Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became so distraught 
over the death of their son that she miscarried and the mummies of both 
Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed. 
</P>
<P>
The story is nonsense, LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli found the fetus 
in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens. It was Schiaparelli, not 
ancient priests, who placed it inside the prince's empty sarcophagus. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction that it has its 
own tiny case.

<HEAD>Campaign Gains Reprieve for Egypt's Largest Colony of Egrets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GIZA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nature lovers defending the country's largest
colony of rare egrets persuaded officials to halt an assault on
nesting trees to keep bird droppings from coating parked cars.
   From the birds' point of view, the victory came in the nick of
time: 11 of the huge trees had been ruined, scores of the majestic
birds have died and hundreds of others fled to safer environs.
   For more than a century, thousands of egrets have made their
homes in 99 tall eucalyptuses beside Cairo Zoo and along Sharia
Giza, or Giza Street, a main boulevard in this Cairo suburb.
   Protected by law as an endangered species, the snow-white birds
became a familiar sight. They flew at dawn to distant fields down
the Nile, where they helped farmers control insects, then returned
to their nests as the sun sank over the pyramids in the distance.
   Just as familiar in recent decades have been the cars parked
along Giza Street, usually splattered with bird droppings.
   This summer, owners of luxury apartments overlooking the zoo
complained to authorities about the droppings and demanded action.
   At midnight Oct. 9, the government sent dozens of men with
bulldozers and chain saws. They spent the rest of the night
obliterating the foliage of the first three trees.
   Inadvertantly, they also destroyed parts of the zoo's antique
iron wall and flattened an empty bus stop.
   ``They made preparations as if it was a war,'' said Mohamed
Hussein Amer, the zoo official in charge of birds and animals and
one of several activists who stopped the anti-egret campaign.
   It took two days for telegrams and phone calls to senior
officials and police to halt the massacre. By then, 11 eucalyptus
evergreens had lost all their branches, as many as 200 egrets were
dead, and about 2,000 others fled into the zoo seeking shelter.
   ``It's not just the issue of 11 butchered trees. It's harmful to
Egypt's reputation,'' Amer said.
   ``It was awful _ children running after the birds, the stray
cats eating the small, helpless chicks in their nests. It was
terrible,'' he said.
   Amer estimated 5,000 pairs of egrets live on the 1\-mile stretch
of Giza Street. But Mindy Bahaa el-Din, a zoo employee from
Indianapolis, said a 1987 survey counted 1,604 pairs.
   Mrs. Bahaa el-Din, associated with the British International
Council for Bird Preservation, said because the egrets' breeding
period was unfinished, most of the chicks were too small to fly to
safety.
   ``The first day I saw the damage, I thought a tornado or
hurricane had hit. At least 100 baby egrets were killed,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bahaa el-Din said Giza's governor, Omar Abdel-Akher,
insisted that the governorate had broken no law.
   ``We haven't killed any birds,'' she said Abdel-Akher told her.
``The law bans hunting birds, and we didn't do that.''
   On Tuesday, the newspaper Al-Ahram reported that Environment
Minister Atef Ebeid had ordered Abdel-Akher to stop the
``cleaning-up campaign.''
   Egrets, tall and thin, boast long white plumes, spindly legs and
elongated, slender bills. They have lived in Egypt for thousands of
years, depicted on walls of ancient tombs.
   Although hundreds of thousands once filled Egyptian fields, they
came close to extinction at the turn of the century as plume
hunters shot them down to obtain feathers for hats. A 1912 law
declared egrets a protected species and their colonies rejuvenated,
but farmers using pesticides killed many of them.
   The 99 eucalyptus trees were planted in 1954 alongside trees
where the free-ranging cattle egrets first nested.
   ``The governorate's report says that the tree branches were
being removed because they were old, dying and diseased,'' said
Amer. ``These eucalyptus trees live for up to 450 years, and they
are certainly not diseased.''
   Another governorate administration about 10 years ago tried to
trim the eucalyptus branches to get rid of the egrets, but a public
uproar ended it.
   Despite the temporary pro-bird victory, Mrs. Bahaa el-Din said
she expects the governorate to insist on moving the colony, but in
a more scientific way, so as not to harm the birds, and without
dismembering the trees.
   A Cairo University professor, who passes the zoo every day,
waxed lyrical when asked about the assault on the trees and the
birds:
   ``One day it was like a beautiful woman whose hair was flowing
in the breeze. Yesterday, it was like somebody had shaved her
head.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They were considered sacred, perhaps holding the
secrets to the origin of life, but nobody knows exactly what they
are. They are symbols of Egypt, along with the pyramids, but many
have found their way to other countries. And wherever they stand
today, obelisks are likely to be overshadowed.

   Their sleek and sensual beauty captivated
Roman emperors scouring their Egyptian domain for exotic trophies.
   Egypt gave one to France and got a clock in return. England
shipped one to London to celebrate a victory over Napoleon. New
Yorkers spirited one away to Central Park.
   But wherever it stands today, pity the poor obelisk. Its magic
is shrinking.
   Once king of the horizon, it's fighting a losing battle in a
world of high-rise skyscrapers.
   Even in Egypt, their home, the few remaining obelisks are
overshadowed by almost every other kind of monument _ tombs,
columns, pyramids, statues. In Cairo, a tower built in 1962 for a
revolving restaurant that doesn't revolve gets more attention than
the 3,250-year-old Gezira obelisk at its base.
   New York City's obelisk, the oldest skyscraper in a city of
skyscrapers, is a midget by today's standards.
   Erected with much fanfare in Central Park on Feb. 22, 1881, it
was the last obelisk to leave Egypt. But, ravaged by the city's
corrosive fumes, it has suffered more from contact with the modern
world than any of the others.
   In ancient times, obelisks were in such demand as trophies of
triumph that Roman emperors hauled away at least 13 to grace public
places in Rome, ``City of Obelisks.'' Fifteen hundred years ago,
the Emperor Theodosius erected an obelisk in the new Byzantine
capital Constantinople, today's Istanbul.
   Paris, London and New York went shopping for their obelisks only
last century.
   Why obelisks? Nobody even knows what they are.
   In his definitive work, ``The Obelisks of Egypt,'' the late
archaeologist Labib Habachi, Egypt's greatest authority, defined an
obelisk as ``a four-sided single piece of stone, standing upright,
gradually tapering as it rises and terminating in a small pyramid
called a pyramidion.''
   They were sacred, he wrote, carved from granite, basalt or
quartzite and decorated with hieroglyphs.
   Habachi's American protege, Egyptologist Cynthia May
Sheikholeslami, says obelisks are among the least-understood relics
of ancient Egypt.
   ``They became one of the most characteristic and unique Egyptian
symbols,'' Sheikholeslami says. ``But we don't know for certain
what they were for.
   ``In ancient times obelisks _ at least their pyramidions _ may
have been covered with gold or electrum (an alloy of gold and
silver) reflecting the sun's rays. They would have been dazzling.''
   Some people believe their stone shafts contain the origins of
life, obelisk magic. Secret societies such as the Knights Templar
of the Crusades and the Freemasons linked obelisks with mysticism.
   America chose the obelisk style as the monument to honor George
Washington, a Freemason.
   Architect Robert Mills designed the Washington Monument with an
elaborate and expensive circular colonnade serving as the obelisk's
base. Government infighting over money continued for decades.
Finally, only the obelisk was left.
   But building a real obelisk was ``an impossible dream'' as it
had been for thousands of years, Sheikholeslami said.
   The problem was, ``Nobody on earth possessed the skills to build
an obelisk. The technology had vanished.''
   Ancient workers took months to create an obelisk, pounding the
mother rock with diorite balls.
   The Washington Monument was fashioned of 36,000 marble-faced
granite blocks. The 555-foot monument was dedicated on Feb. 21,
1885, an obelisk in shape only.
   Nobody knows when the first obelisks appeared. Pharaohs of the
Fifth Dynasty, ardent sun worshipers whose period began almost
4,500 years ago, are thought to have been the first to decorate
their temples with obelisks in pairs.
   Sheikholeslami said some may have been put up to celebrate
pharaohs' anniversaries, others their victories. Small obelisks
were erected at tombs.
   Despite their pagan origin, obelisks were blessed by popes and
associated with early Christianity.
   They decorated French and English houses. A wealthy citizen of
Philadelphia erected a large obelisk over his family's burial
vault. Smaller versions served as grave markers.
   But they are best known outside Egypt as centerpieces in public
squares and parks.
   Augustus Caesar, whose 44-year reign began in 30 B.C., began the
trend by taking one obelisk for Rome's Circus Maximus, another for
the Field of Mars.
   Cairo didn't get around to erecting an obelisk for show until
1958, a rose granite needle shipped upstream from the ancient Nile
Delta city of Tanis to Gezira Island in the heart of the capital.
True to form, the island now is famous not for its 47{-foot-tall
obelisk but for Cairo Tower, soaring 594 feet just behind.
   ``When we brought it to Gezira, we had no idea that the Cairo
Tower would be built behind it,'' Egyptologist Kamal el-Mallakh, a
prime mover behind the project, said shortly before his death in
1987. ``If we had known, we wouldn't have done it. The obelisk is
lost.''
   Antiquities officials spent $1.2 million in 1984 to place an
obelisk at Cairo International Airport. It's lost, too, because
most flights land and leave Cairo in the dark.
   Scores of obelisks once guarded entry into Egypt's sacred
temples. Only four still stand in their original slots.
   Twin obelisks were moved in antiquity from the temple of the sun
god Ra, home of the phoenix in ancient Heliopolis, to the
Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Misnamed ``Cleopatra's Needles,''
one now stands beside the River Thames in London, the second in
Central Park.
   Other obelisks lie in ruins, toppled by earthquakes or
desecrated by conquerors seeking to destroy a mysterious power said
to lurk within.
   The oldest standing obelisk dates from the reign of Pharaoh
Sesostris I, 4,000 years ago, at the site of the Ra temple. Now
enveloped by apartment houses, it rises from a small park in a
bustling, crowded Cairo suburb.
   The largest, 97 feet high and weighing 323 tons, was built 3,700
years ago by Queen Hatshepsut for the Karnak Temple complex in
Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo. A smaller, more damaged obelisk
belonging to her father Tuthmosis I stands nearby.
   Both are ignored by thousands of tourists daily, who prefer to
photograph immense decorated columns and monumental statues erected
150 years later by Pharaoh Ramses II.
   Egypt's most famous survivor is Ramses' own obelisk at the
entrance to nearby Luxor Temple.
   Its twin stands in Paris' Place de la Concorde, a gift from
Egypt. France reciprocated with a small clock, placed in a
courtyard adjacent to Mohammed Ali Mosque in Cairo's Citadel.
   The timepiece doesn't work.
   And Ramses' once-great obelisk outside Luxor Temple is leaning.

EGYPT'S MINISTER OF CULTURE KEEPS EYE ON THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"For most foreigners, Egypt's culture is in the past. For us, Egypt is not of 
the past, it is the future," said Farouk Hosni, Egypt's minister of culture, in 
an interview over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's past is unrivaled and unparalleled. In the present it has many rivals 
and many cultures surpass it, but Egypt also aspires to have a strong presence 
in the contemporary world." 
</P>
<P>
People who don't know Egypt well are surprised to learn about the vitality of 
its contemporary arts, he said. "We are trying to find the means to express 
this richness." Following in the footsteps of writer Andre Malraux in France 
and actress Melina Mercouri in Greece, Hosni, a painter, is among the rare 
breed of artists who serve their countries as high-level administrators. On his 
first visit to the United States -- a 12-day jaunt that includes Dallas, New 
York and Washington -- Hosni was a guest of the Getty Conservation Institute 
for four days in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an artist doesn't just mean that you create things but that you are a 
person of vision and imagination," said Hosni, speaking through a translator in 
his hotel room in Marina del Rey. The difficulty for artist-administrators is 
that they are inclined to be "idealistic perfectionists," he said, but they 
also have an advantage: an ability to dream. "The problem is not the artist's 
visionary point of view but the means -- the material tools -- to carry out his 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
A dashing figure who might be mistaken for a film star, Hosni said his 
childhood dreams were formed by Hollywood movies. While his visit to Los 
Angeles returned him to "the old days of American cinema" (in part through a 
tour of Universal Studios), his official purpose was to shape Egypt's cultural 
future. To that end, his itinerary was packed with meetings with museum 
administrators, ceremonial meals, visits to local cultural institutions -- the 
J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art -- and a conference on "The First Egyptians: Pyramid Age and 
Before" at the Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's writers, composers and plastic artists are the strength of the 
country's contemporary culture, Hosni said. The formerly vital Egyptian film 
industry, whose products have been widely distributed in the Arab world, has 
declined for reasons not unique to Egypt: the rise of video and an increasing 
emphasis on making movies for profit, he said. Movie theaters have closed 
because Egyptians watch movies at home. "Every home has a VCR, if not two or 
three," Hosni said, and most of them show imported movies. Asked if a Muslim 
fundamentalist movement had also crippled the film industry, Hosni said that 
"at a certain point, about two or three years ago, it was a menace to the 
arts," but that threat has now "collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
Hosni said his primary challenge in promoting the arts is to find ways to put 
them on a sound economic footing and even turn them into money-making ventures. 
"The arts can be a real source of income by attracting tourism," he said, 
insisting that spotlighting the arts is also a way of raising quality. "If the 
quality is good, the art is wanted." He calls the concept "the 
industrialization of culture" and noted that other countries have found culture 
to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to show the civilized face of Egypt" to tourists, said Hosni, who 
wants that face to include more than spectacular monuments. He envisions -- and 
has already begun to work on -- performing and visual arts centers located at 
archeological sites. Contemporary artists' work would be cast in the impressive 
light of history, while "forlorn and forgotten" archeological sites would come 
to life again as venues for arts exhibitions, performances and other programs. 
Hosni plans to hit "every target. Any building or site that has its own 
character can be turned into a cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even the most forward-looking minister of culture cannot forget the 
past. The needs of Egypt's disintegrating monuments are enormous -- and these 
ancient treasures demand foreign expertise and resources. The Getty 
Conservation Institute has come to the rescue of the 3,500-year-old tomb of 
Queen Nefertari, across the Nile River from Luxor in southern Egypt. An 
international team headed by Italians is salvaging wall paintings that were 
gravely endangered by water and salts. The tomb, which has been closed since 
the early '50s, will reopen to tourists in 1991, Hosni said. 
</P>
<P>
Such success stories are tempered by the fact that Egypt has about 10,000 
archeological sites that are deteriorating at an ever-increasing rate. Urban 
encroachment, pollutants, changing water tables and tourism are all taking 
their toll. Conservation of the Giza Plateau, including pyramids and the 
Sphinx, is a $50-million job, according to Hosni. But the project is 
"completely feasible," he said. Saving "the world's first Surrealist statue" is 
"no problem," Hosni said with visionary optimism. "All we need is material and 
scientific resources."

<TEXT>
   Indiana Jones and his swashbuckling treasure
hunts would have been at home in Egypt in the early 1800s, when a
mix of travelers and adventurers became _ by chance _ the world's
first Egyptologists.
   The calling still retained a lot of Harrison Ford's movie
character in 1922 when Howard Carter, an eccentric Briton, dug into
the most famous tomb of all, the gold-packed burial place of Pharaoh
Tutankhamon.
   But as Egyptology prepares to enter the 21st century, the country
that gave the science its name is asking modern lovers of its
ancient past to give up the shovel and trowel. Don't dig and
destroy, Egyptian antiquities officials are saying, but restore and
rebuild.
   ``Our grandfathers, the ancient Egyptians, were reaching for
eternity,'' the acting chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization, M.A. Nur-el-din, told the fifth annual International
Congress of Egyptology. ``It's our task to let them remain eternal.
It's time we looked on the ancient Egyptians as subjects, not just
objects.''
   To thousands of years of wayfarers, Egypt's monuments have seemed
immortal, a rich and glorious past paraded in stone monoliths and on
tomb walls. Evidence is growing, however, that the immortality was
fleeting: Time is running out.
   ``New artifacts keep coming up at new digs ... (but) where are we
going?'' said Egyptology professor Faiza Haikal. ``We must leave the
artifacts safely buried in the ground (and) restore and preserve
what has been unearthed.
   ``The once slow process of deterioration is accelerating. We have
the usual problems of environment and a rising water table, but now
the monuments face the spread of settlements, with sewage and other
risks.''
   Most scholars are aware of, and strongly support, the changing
face of Egyptology, its shift from seeking treasure to seeking
knowledge. Many of today's Egyptologists spend their days before
delicately painted walls or engraved columns, copying pictures and
writings that are disappearing at a frightening rate.
   Others dig, but in remote sites or at the edges of villages whose
high birth rates demand the use of all available land, whether or
not history lies beneath it.
   Unlike the tomb of the boy pharoah Tutankhamun, discovered almost
in tact and containing hordes of treasure beyond belief, many sites
in Egypt contain only fragments only _ pottery pieces rich enough
for the scholar but perhaps not substantial enough to raise funds
for the ever increasing price of mounting expeditions.
   Hundreds of subjects tantalize modern Egyptologists, ranging from
pyramid research and the Sphinx, to the secret language of the
baboons, Egypt in the Old Testament, magic in ancient Egypt, adverbs
and adverb clauses, the position of Tutankhamun's feathered corselet
against iconographical sources, the role of the handicapped people
in ancient Egypt, the transition from tribe to state and some
aspects of the use of honey in ancient Egypt.
   The profession has come a long way from the image of the solitary
Egyptologist trotting over desert sands on his faithful donkey,
wind-blasted and poor, trying to fight off eternity-starved mummies
and antiquities smugglers with baskets of tana leaves.
   Gamal Mokhtar, director for the international effort to save the
monuments of Nubia during the 1960s, has witnessed many of the
changes, including the passing of Egypt's heritage from foreign to
local hands and items of national heritage required to be kept in
Egypt.
   ``Egyptology as a science began after different evils,'' he said.
``You had monumental neglect of the monuments from the days of the
pharoahs. Then you had Christians and the monuments on religious
grounds.
   ``Then you had ... Napoleon Bonaparte bringing with him in his
attempt to conquer Egypt hundreds of artists and scientists, who
awakened the eyes of the world to the glories that still could be
found in Egypt.''
   Hundreds came either to study or steal, he said. Then, in 1799,
the Rosetta Stone _ with its ancient Greek and Egyptian inscriptions
_ was found, providing a key to deciphering the hidden meaning of
ancient Egyptian writing (hieroglyphics).
   Mokhtar has also witnessed high technology replacing hands in an
attempt to locate hidden artifacts. Satellite photos provide what
years of walking might never show. In some large sites, instruments
replace the questioning mind, showing just the spot where buried
history can be found, though seldom indicating exactly what lies
below.
   But for most Egyptologists dirt-under-the fingernails is still
where it's at.
   ``You know what things are by touching them,'' said archaeologist
and Egyptologist Michael Jones. ``You won't know what glass is
except when you feel it, though high technology has its place.
   For the past five years Jones and his wife, Egyptologist Angelea
Milward, have searched for clues to one of the most important
religious relics in ancient Egypt, the Apis bull, on a site
surrounded by a village some 45 minutes south of Cairo.
   Though they were not searching for treasure and have found
nothing of great value, they are content that they have added facts
missing from the pages of ancient Egypt.
   ``Up until the 19th century, much of ancient Egypt was frozen in
time,'' Jones said. ``Because there was wealth still buried in
Egypt, people came looking for goodies and found them. It's a great
tragedy, because lay people nowadays are mesmerized, knocked over
backwards by Tutankhamun and the famous statues.''
   For today's Egyptologist working in the field, the goal is to
band together the facts in order to reveal a three dimensional side
to what has been found.
   ``But it's difficult,'' Jones said, ``because many of the
artifacts have been taken from their home. We have parts of
monuments, other parts remaining in museums and elsewhere out of
Egypt. Physical remains are often seen in isolation.
   ``Imagine someone 3,000 years from now trying to recreate our
world?''
   Jones said there are few shortcuts in his profession. He walks
and walks his site, then walks it again, trying to turn back the
clock.
   ``You get to know your site the way you know your house,'' he
said.
   ``What's happening in Egyptology is the ancient Egyptians are no
longer the curiosities they once were. You can meet them via
archaeology and not in the fancified terms Egyptologists used in the
old days.
   ``You try to understand them in their own environment. You're not
just digging up artifacts; you're digging up people.''

<HEAD>After California Quake, Egyptians Wonder About Aswan High Dam</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Earthquakes in the past disfigured one of
Ramses II's colossal faces at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt, toppled
Alexandria's Pharos Lighthouse and destroyed some of Cairo's most
beautiful mosques.
   But they've failed to faze the oldest of the great monuments,
the Giza pyramids or, so far, the newest, Gamal Abdul Nasser's
Aswan High Dam, which began operating in 1971.
   In October, when the killer earthquake struck northern
California, followed by another closer to home in Algeria,
Egyptians began to worry about the High Dam's safety.
   Seventeen times the size of Cheops' Great Pyramid, the
Soviet-built Aswan is the world's largest rock-filled dam and it
holds back the world's second largest man-made lake, 310-mile-long
Lake Nasser.
   A serious breach of the dam would send a huge wall of water _ an
estimated 110 billion gallons _ roaring through the Nile River
valley, where almost all Egypt's 55 million people live.
   Rushing toward the Mediterranean Sea, it would sweep away much
of ancient and modern Egypt and reach Cairo in three days.
   ``When I'm asked if the Aswan High Dam is safe from earthquakes,
I can say it is, up to magnitude 7 on the Richter scale, because
we've made a mock-up of the dam and tested it,'' said geophysicist
R.M. Kebeasy, Egypt's leading dam expert.
   ``Even if an earthquake were to occur beneath the dam itself, it
would withstand it to this level. Still, we're taking no chances.
We monitor seismic activity 24 hours a day.''
   On Nov. 14, 1981, a 5.6 quake centered 40 miles to the south of
the dam and a series of aftershocks startled Aswan's residents.
   It was the strongest in living memory at Aswan, and all of Egypt
shared Aswan's concern.
   ``Even though this earthquake was not a major concern for us, we
took earthquakes seriously from that time,'' Kebeasy said. Within
months Egypt had its first seismic station at Aswan, equipped with
U.S.-supplied equipment and advisers.
   Pressure on the dam and the surrounding geology is daunting.
   Every year for eons, an estimated 134 million tons of sediment
made its way down the Nile to the sea. Now it is captured behind
the dam, adding that much more weight to the lakebed.
   Water levels and pressure shift constantly, accommodating
differences in wind direction, flow northward from Sudan,
temperature and other factors.
   Kebeasy said geologists weren't at all surprised when
earthquakes started occurring as the lake began to fill.
   ``We thought the largest ones would appear when water is
highest,'' he said. ``They don't. The strongest ones coincide with
drought.''
   He predicts that earthquake activity will diminish as the dam
area conditions itself to its new geological feature: a huge lake.
   But other experts, such as Boston University's Egyptian-born
Farouk el-Baz, advise caution.
   ``You have an immense weight of water, and you have water
seeping through faults acting as a lubricant,'' he said. ``People
should neither sit around worrying about it nor forget it. You have
to be on the alert.''
   An early critic of the dam was geologist Farkhonda Hassan, a
former member of parliament, now a professor at American University
in Cairo.
   She and others still question whether the Aswan earthquakes are
caused by the weight of the lake or, more dangerously, by faults
like the San Andreas that caused the California quake that measured
7.1.
   The dam was built, she noted, in Nasser's time.
   ``You couldn't criticize. If you did you were branded a bad
Egyptian,'' she added.
   ``There were scientists in Egypt willing and able to do in-depth
geological surveys of the area, but we weren't included.
   ``I believe the dam would have been built anyway, but I would
like to have seen it built with more science.''

FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Quiet times for Egypt's King Tut tat sellers - The
best time to see Egypt's temples may have been now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hearing where we spent the new year, people look at us with the kind of
respect due to someone who has come back from Bosnia. 'You went to Egypt]
Wasn't that dangerous?' We demur. Ten days in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan were
fascinating and unforgettable. Yes, we would go back like a shot.
Not that this is the happiest phrase, given the prevalent view of Egypt as a
country in the grip of bearded fanatics who shoot anyone in a swimsuit. It
has been a disastrous period for tourism, Egypt's second most important
currency earner. On December 27, while we were there, the most serious
attack on tourists to date took place when Moslem extremists bombed and
fired on a coach carrying Austrians in old Cairo.
Meanwhile, we were at Aswan, congratulating ourselves on our prescience. At
the new and comfortable Ibis Island Hotel, hovering waiters outnumbered
sunbathers. It was the same at Luxor, where in the heat of the afternoon
barely a handful of sun-worshippers lay beside the Winter Palace's pool. The
moon was full, but there seemed to be no honeymooning couples under the
royal palms which once witnessed King Farouk's indiscretions.
For a century, tourism has been the life-blood of a town such as Luxor. Now
there is little for the sellers of King Tut tat to do but draw on their
waterpipes. The mood is one of dejection and, so far as one can tell, anger.
When we took a sail in a felucca, the captain made mint tea on his primus
stove. Suddenly he stood up and announced that if he found the 'bad men' who
had scared away the tourists, 'I will catch them and eat them with my
teeth]'
Luxor and Aswan have foreign-run luxury hotels to suit all pockets, although
for elegance and architectural distinction the Old Cataract Hotel at Aswan
is unsurpassed. Whether hotels have one star or five, though, they are all
short of guests. Ask the price of a room and managers say they are
negotiable.
Winter is peak season and, even now, Karnak, Thebes and the Valley of the
Kings are far from deserted, especially if you dawdle in the morning or
coincide with a cruise ship.
The best plan, for mature travellers with a sense of humour, is to reject
organised tours and travel independently. From Luxor, Cairo and Aswan, it is
possible to do all the major sites with guides hired through local
companies, or to do the sites alone. For around Pounds 25, you can hire a
taxi from 7am to 7pm.
After two centuries of tourism, it is almost banal to enthuse about the
monumental remains of the pharoahs, Ptolemies and Romans. In the Cairo
suburbs there are the Giza pyramids with the astoundingly elegant Barge of
Cheops - often skimped by tour companies. There is Memphis and the majestic
stepped pyramid at Sakkara.
In Upper Egypt, there is Luxor where, last October, to boost falling
revenue, Tutankhamen's tomb was reopened in the Valley of the Kings. Then
there are the temples of Karnak, Luxor, Abydos - where the head of Osiris
was said to rest - Dendera, and yet others.
Aswan is a prettier, less pressured town than Luxor, and the place you go to
for visiting the temples rescued from the waters of the Aswan high dam.
Philae is small and, even now, uncomfortably crowded. At the other end of
the dam, few people go to New Kalabsha where a family of tame sand foxes
plays in the sanctuary of Marul. Further upstream, reached by bus or
aircraft, lies Abu Simbel.
It is only possible to imagine what the ancient mystery cults might have
been like when there is silence in the huge temples. Peace reigns in the
huge Ptolemaic temple of Hathor at Dendera, where for centuries people went
from all over Egypt for the new year festivities.
Figures appear from the shadows, muttering the names of deities until paid
off with a note or two. On the temple's massive roof, it is completely quiet
and one sits for an hour or so, just gazing at the panorama with its
contrast between barren desert and cultivation.
In his book, Egypt, Land of the Valley, Robin Fedden described the Nile as
'like East Anglia with the form and tone of Provence'. It is a richly
beautiful landscape, utterly engrossing to watch. Egrets slowly criss-cross
the fields and hoopoes perch on the lemon trees. There are palm trees and
pigeon roosts, water buffalo and camels which sway past laden with sugar
cane.
Village houses are made of mud or bricks fired in kilns beside the road. If
their owners have made the pilgrimage to Mecca, they paint scenes from the
journey on the external walls. Electric pumps send Nile water gushing into
the clover and sugar cane, but the shaduf (buckets on pivots) and
Archimedean water wheel are still used.
The average fellahin family has six children, which explains why there are
so many people. Women squat outside washing clothes and making bread.
Children jog past, two or even three to a donkey, waving at tourists and
often darting into the road. Driving is best left to the Egyptians,
particularly at night, when the practice is to switch off headlights and
then flash them wildly at oncoming traffic.
The contrast between upper Egypt and Cairo, traffic-choked, squalid and
chaotic, could not be greater. Yet Cairo also has to be seen, and we found
four days too short. Its medieval heritage is one of the most impressive of
any city in the world, although shamefully neglected by the authorities.
Its principal Islamic monuments are architectural gems: Ibn Tulun, the
exquisite Madrasah of Sultan Hasan and the noble mausolea of the Mamluks in
the North Cemetery. Egyptians appear totally relaxed about non-Moslems in
mosques, providing they are modestly dressed (no shorts) and remove their
shoes. I would always cover my head, too, although many Arab women did not.
Even in seething Cairo, it was obvious how blessed a time it was to be
sight-seeing. At the Great Pyramid on a Friday afternoon, foreigners were
outnumbered by Cairenes picnicking in their best clothes.
More extraordinary still was our visit to Cairo's Egypt Museum. By
lunchtime, the Japanese and Arab visitors had gone, giving a parting caress
to the statues they passed. That left us almost alone in the upper
galleries, where case after case displays the Tutankhamen finds, his war
chariots, sandals, linen, furniture, throwing sticks and perfume jars.
It may be that our persons were at marginally greater risk in Egypt rather
than in rain-sodden London. (It last rained in Aswan four years ago.) Our
choice, however, was to believe people living or doing business in Cairo who
insisted on Egypt's reputation as an unusually safe place for foreigners.
Strolling in the evenings we felt completely safe. We succeeded in avoiding
gastric misery by eating conservatively and only in first-class restaurants.
The most unpleasant experience was a glass of Omar Khayyam rose - Egyptian
wine can be lethal.
All the guidebooks comment on Egyptians' warmth and kindness towards
foreigners, and they are right. The commonest word one hears is 'welcome'.
One of the next commonest is 'baksheesh' from children in the street. Part
of the scene is the begging, the need to be for ever tipping, and the street
hassling. Instead of letting these customs get under your skin, it is better
to ignore them as an inconvenience more than compensated for by the
Egyptians' good manners and love of a joke.
After all, it is Egypt's Islamic traditions which make a holiday there such
a rich experience. Inshallah - as pious Egyptians frame every future wish -
I will return to the Nile. As for the temples, the best time to be there may
have been now.

Pyramid Power: Egyptomania on the Mississippi

<DATELINE> Memphis, Tenn.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This delta city where once cotton, then Elvis, was king has a new ruler -- a 3,200-year-old Pharaoh named Ramesses II. 
There are mummies at the Pink Palace Museum and swaddled mannequins simulating them in the windows of M.M. Cohn, hieroglyphic cartouches painted in downtown crosswalks and Egyptian murals on classroom walls. 
You can "room with Ramesses" at the Ridgeway Inn and eat a "Ramburger" at Huey's. 
There's even serious talk of erecting a 32-story, $48 million golden pyramid arena on the river front. 

   "It's almost impossible to walk into a public place and not hear people talking about Ramesses," says Lynn Gipson, a student at Memphis State University. 

   The immediate cause of the Pharaonic fever isn't hard to find. 
"Ramesses the Great," an eye-popping exhibition of Egyptian treasures -- including a 24-foot, seven-inch colossus specially restored for this occasion -- has just begun a 4 1/2-month run at the Memphis Convention Center with more than 300,000 tickets sold in advance. (The spelling in the show's title is the one used by most Egyptologists.) 

   But Egyptomania runs as deep here as the roots of the city's stately white oaks, stretching back over a century and a half. 
Gazing at the Mississippi from the Fourth Chickasaw Bluff, town founder Gen. James Winchester was reminded of another great river -- the Nile -- and an ancient metropolis that had flourished there. 
What more auspicious name for a new settlement than that of this storied city -- Memphis? 

   Memphis, the Egyptian one, was also on the mind of MSU art professor Charles Allgood, who back in 1975 persuaded the university to acquire a teaching collection of 44 objects spanning the full range of Egyptian history and culture. (The collection has since tripled in size.) 

   To celebrate the installation of the artifacts in its new gallery in the fall of 1983, MSU organized a loan exhibition, "A Divine Tour of Ancient Egypt." 
Young Egyptologist Rita Freed was invited to curate it. 
She accepted, then consulted a map to locate Memphis. 

   "I think people had so much fun with that show, they just weren't willing to let it die," the ebullient Ms. Freed recalls with a smile. 
The "Divine Tour" begat an audacious plan -- an Egyptological institute for Memphis State. 
The response it aroused would have gratified even Ramesses: Within a week, local businessmen pledged $1 million over a 10-year period. 
"We thought right from the beginning that this could be something to set Memphis apart from other cities," says Richard A. Trippeer Jr., chairman of Union Planters National Bank, one of the facility's biggest backers. 

   In October, 1984, Jihan Sadat formally opened MSU's Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology, with Ms. Freed as its director. 
Discussions had already begun with the venerable London-based Egypt Exploration Society on joint excavation efforts to help save the site of ancient Memphis from a rising water table and monument-eroding soil salinization. 

   In short order the institute bought a 3,500-volume Egyptian library from the estate of scholar H. W. Fairman. 
Then it acquired 1,000 volumes from Memphis-born Egyptologist Elizabeth Thomas. 
And in 1985 it added a second Egyptologist. 
"I'm sitting here in Brooklyn in awe of what they've done; it's a textbook case of development," observes James Romano, an associate curator at the Brooklyn Museum. 

   Word about the institute traveled fast. 
One day local resident Claire Austin brought in a rose-red hatbox containing a curious object that had been kicking around her family for decades. 
Lifting the lid of the box, Ms. Freed got quite a surprise: It contained "one of the best-preserved mummy heads in existence." 

   Publicity about the find brought the institute a call from a Detroit pawnbroker with an offer it couldn't refuse -- a full mummy, complete with beautifully crafted coffin (and documentation that it hadn't been smuggled out of Egypt). 
Rescued at a cost of $45,000 from the unheated storage room where he had spent the previous decade, the 2,500-year-old mummy was honored with a gala ceremony in January, 1986. 
Mayor Richard C. Hackett welcomed the city's "oldest and most expensive resident"; soldiers from a visiting production of "Aida" carried the coffin. 

   But Memphians hadn't seen anything yet. 
Thanks to one Honey Scheidt, they would. 

   While touring Egypt with her husband, the institute board member dropped in at the Cairo Museum. 
Director Mohamed Saleh told her about a blockbuster exhibition he was preparing to send to several cities overseas. 
Replied Honey, "Great; why can't Memphis have it?" 

   There were many why nots; protracted negotiations by a team led by Mayor Hackett overcame them. 
But the Memphians weren't content with the existing show of more than 70 artifacts. 
"The previous high attendance for an exhibition in the city had been 60,000," explains Ms. Freed, who would curate the exhibit here. 
"We needed somehow to lure people who would never think of coming to a museum." 

   The Tennessee Memphians found what they were looking for in the weeds behind a museum in Memphis, Egypt. 
Even in its ruined condition -- three huge hunks of granite and several dozen smaller fragments -- there was an aura of majesty about the shattered colossus. 

   The Egyptian Antiquities Organization was sympathetic. 
After all, it did have a stake in the show. (Each host city had to guarantee the EAO $350,000 for use of the antiquities plus any profits after the cost of staging the exhibition.) 
Nevertheless, it was firm: Ramesses the Great couldn't be shown in a less-than-stately state. 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Memphis provided the $100,000 necessary to restore the statue. 

   While a team of 30 conservators labored in Egypt, in Tennessee the presenters were working equally hard to engineer the exhibit's success. 
A delegation headed by Mayor Hackett and Raouf El Reedy, the Egyptian ambassador to the U.S., hosted promotional receptions in six key regional cities. (The morning after its presentation in Jackson, Miss., bookings were made for 108 bus-loads of tourists.) 

   Word about the show was also spread through the Mid-South by a "speakers bureau" of volunteer lecturers. 
In nine months the 55 speakers, who gave slide presentations on Ramesses and his time to Rotaries, Kiwanis, Lions and gardening clubs, reached as many as 20,000 potential ticket buyers. 

   But perhaps the best advertisement for "Ramesses the Great" is the show itself. 
Each host city has been responsible for its own exhibition design and catalog, and in both areas Memphis has done itself proud. 
The Egyptian temple setting designed by George Sexton Associates succeeds in creating a museum ambience within a cavernous space. 
And Ms. Freed's vivid, copiously illustrated catalog (City of Memphis, 239 pages; $25 hardcover, $10 soft) is the equal of the exhibit. 

   Beyond the rippling economic impact on the city -- $75 million to $100 million according to the latest projections -- there may be broader benefits. 
Many regard the exhibition as a unifying force in a community once torn apart by the assassination here of Martin Luther King Jr. 
"We can all pull together over Egyptology," says Vivian Berryhill, chairman of the show's visitors' information center. 
Her husband, pastor of the Rising Sun Baptist Church, is one of the black clergymen throughout the city "getting the word out on Ramesses" and encouraging group visits by their flocks. 

   Eventually Memphis will have a permanent reminder of Ramesses if it proceeds with the proposed golden pyramid. 
But it won't be the city's first. 
That distinction belongs to a 19 1/2-foot-tall sculpture that looks like a pyramid when you're whizzing by the Welcome Center on I-55 South. 
"I hope this stimulates Memphis to build another pyramid," says sculptor Tom Wuchina. 
"This great city should be known for something besides barbecue and Elvis Presley."

<HEAD>Texas Cities Duel over Ramses; Dallas Wins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas beat out San Antonio in a Texas-sized
duel for the right to hold an exhibition featuring artifacts of
Ramses II, one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs.
   Cairo's archaeological circles dubbed it the second ``Gunfight
at the O.K. Corral.''
   Each city was armed with what it considered a valid
letter-of-intent signed by Egyptian officials promising the popular
exhibit of the pharoah who ruled Egypt 3,200 years ago.
   The Ramses exhibit will go to the Museum of Natural History in
Dallas in April and then return to Egypt. A compromise worked out
Thursday won't leave San Antonio empty-handed.
   The San Antonio Museum of Art will be second in line for ``Art
of Ancient Egypt,'' a new exhibition of art treasures from Egypt's
Nile Delta region. The exhibit debuts in November at Washington's
National Gallery and then travels to San Antonio in March 1990.
   ``I think it's a good solution,'' said Zahi Hawass, the
archaeological adviser to Egypt's Minister of Culture who drafted
the compromise.
   The Ramses exhibit opened in Montreal in 1985 and is on display
in Boston.
   The U.S. tour opened in Provo, Utah, in October 1985, and it has
been an attraction at Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and
Denver. It heads to Charlotte, N.C., in September before moving to
Dallas.
   Hawass said the problem between Dallas and San Antonio occurred
because both cities thought the Ramses exhibit was going to their
museums.
   ``Dallas has been interested in Ramses for about two years,'' he
said. ``And there is letter signed by Egyptian officials, which
Dallas considered a letter of intent, and San Antonio later signed
a regular letter of intent.
   ``So we were left with two cities, each wanting Ramses and each
thinking its letter was legal. We had to reach some sort of
solution.''
   Money from both exhibits will help finance a new Museum of the
Egyptian Civilization to be built in Cairo and the Nubia Museum at
Aswan, 615 miles to the south.
   Hawass said Dallas' contract calls for payment to the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization of $750,000, plus $100,000 for the use of
a 27-foot-tall Ramses statue restored by Egyptian and American
experts in honor of the exhibition.
   He said the agreement also calls for the organization to receive
5 percent of profits from the catalog and related items sold in the
museum shop.
   ``In the past Egypt didn't get a proper financial return for its
exhibits sent abroad. The Tutankhamun exhibit that toured England
and the United States is the best example,'' Hawass said. ``We know
every museum hosting such an exhibit makes $10 million to $12
million. Each exhibit draws more than a million viewers.''
   The exhibit featured gold and other items from Pharaoh
Tutankhamun's tomb, which toured several countries in the 1970s.
Egyptian officials complained that contracts were too tightly
drawn, leaving them out in the cold as far as sharing the profits.
   Hawass said the Culture Ministry has decided to demand for
future exhibits a minimum of $850,000, plus 50 percent from the
sale of catalogues and other items.
   ``We take a risk in sending artifacts out of Egypt,'' he said.

<LEADPARA>  New evidence that Egypt's Great Sphinx may be twice as old as had been thought
has triggered a fierce argument between geologists who say that it must be
older and archaeologists who hold that that conclusion contradicts everything

the Geological Society of America convention here Tuesday found that
weathering patterns on the great monument were characteristic of a period far

<TEXT>     Predecessors incapable?; But archaeologists and Egyptologists insist that
even if the Sphinx is older than they think, it could not be much older
because the people who lived in that region earlier could not have built it.; 
 Most Egyptologists believe that the Sphinx was built during the reign of the
Pharaoh Khafre, also known as Chephren, in approximately 2500 B.C. But
scientists who conducted a series of unprecedented studies at the Giza site
told colleagues their evidence shows that the Sphinx was there long before
Khafre came to power.;   The scientists say the evidence suggests that Khafre
simply refurbished the Sphinx, which may have been several thousand years old,
and incorporated it into his funereal complex.;   'Conservative' estimate;
Geologist Robert Schoch of Boston University told the meeting that his
research suggests the Sphinx actually dates back to between 5000 B.C. and 7000
B.C.;   "And I'm trying to be conservative," he said in an interview.;   But
archaeologist Carol Redmount of the University of California, Berkeley, who
specializes in Egyptian artifacts, said, "There's just no way that could be
true.";   The people of that region would not have had the technology, the
governing institutions or even the will to have built such a structure
thousands of years before Khafre's reign, she added.  </TEXT>

FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: An acquired taste for the pyramids - Patricia Morison
reviews 'Egyptomania' at the Louvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Venturi put jokey little coloured lotus-columns outside the National
Gallery extension and IM Pei's glass pyramid now squats in the forecourt of
the Louvre. But although post-modern architects now and then use ancient
Egypt as a source for references, repro-Pharaonic seems to have had its day.
It barely survives, except in the tourist gift-shops of Egypt which are
still crammed with pyramid paperweights and busts of Tutenkhamun.
Egyptomania, the Louvre's clever, complicated, but indigestible new
exhibition, opens a chapter in the history of taste. It shows the many forms
for which over two centuries, from 1730 to 1930, western art and
architecture gleefully and unselfconsciously adapted artistic motifs from
the land of the Pharaohs.
Although repro-Ramessian is nowadays rejected as kitsch, Egyptian style was
once extremely influential. It was more exotic than Greco-Roman, more
accessible than Etruscan, and highly prestigious. Egyptian style was
enormously versatile, associated with eternity, manliness, sexiness,
exoticism, non-Christian piety, and patriotism.
As an architectural style, it was also relatively simple and cheap in
comparison with classicism. So it was used extensively, for garden design,
prisons, cemeteries, in bourgeois villas, Russian palaces, and the
staterooms of Mediterranean cruisers.
The exhibition will travel to Canada and Vienna, although not all 300
exhibits appear at each of the venues. Yet there is something undeniably
special about seeing it in Paris. At the Louvre one is just a step away from
the magnificent obelisk looted from the temple of Karnak at Thebes. Close by
are squares where grotesque ceremonies were staged in which huge statues of
Isis, the Goddess Nature, expressed jets of wine from her breasts into the
cups of thirsty revolutionaries. France even has the best claim to be called
the cradle of Egyptology, born on September 27, 1822 when Champollion
announced that he had discovered how to read hieroglyphics.
How will the exhibition look elsewhere? At the Louvre, the organisers have
gone for style over comfort. Tiny video-screens displayed at the cases show
pyramids and obelisks in gardens and play extracts from Mozart's Magic
Flute. The overall design is a pitch-black labyrinth as if it was intended
to evoke some ancient ritual. I found it claustrophobic and tiring.
On the other hand, it made possible a great bit of theatre. Dotted through
the darkness are white rooms containing the 'real thing', famous pieces from
the Louvre's Egyptian galleries. Some pieces are Egyptian and some are
Egyptianising Roman sculptures, chosen not just because of their intrinsic
merits but because they inspired later artists.
The most remarkable of these antique pieces is the exceptionally beautiful
pink marble statue from Munich. It is one of the famous series which Emperor
Hadrian ordered to be made to immortalise his lover, Antinous, drowned in
the Nile. Because eclectic Rome was so enamoured of her Egyptian colony, it
seemed quite natural that Hadrian should order the gorgeous youth to be
represented as the god Osiris. From the mid-16th century, this sculpture
could be seen by visitors to the Villa Albani at Rome, setting a standard
for Egyptian art (as Antinous was thought to be).
The variety and quality of exhibits is overwhelming, with paintings,
furniture, architectural drawings, ceramics, sculpture, jewellery, and
fashion accessories. Theatre design gets a corridor to itself. There are
important set and costume designs for the Magic Flute, for Rossini's Moses,
and for Verdi's Aida, although, as we are reminded, it was the Egyptologist
Mariette Bey who deserves so much of the credit.
Apart from occasional treasures like Schinkel's Magic Flute designs and
Boullee's project for a warrior's grave, there is almost nothing in the show
to which I would give house-room. Not for me the model obelisks and sphinxes
for the mantelpiece, the tremendously elaborate clocks made to look like
Egyptian temples or Nubian slave-girls.
Anyone less insensitive to pseudo-Egyptian furniture will discover rare and
fabulous pieces. Among the most remarkable are two 18th-century bookcases,
one for a French civic library and one commissioned by an Austrian abbot.
Painstaking copies of Egyptian temple style, they were made expressly to
hold the 25 volumes of the celebrated Description de l'Egypte. Remarkable
too, is a late 19th-century grand piano made with two statues of pharaonic
noblemen to each leg.
The selection of paintings is quite as remarkable, including many comically
ghastly 19th-century specimens many of which look still worse for being
badly lit and in such solidly Egyptian company. They make the point well,
however, that successful painters needed to read up Egyptology if they were
to tackle popular subjects like Moses in the Bullrushes, or the Death of
Cleopatra.
John Martin's 'Seventh Plague of Egypt' and David Roberts's 'Departure of
the Israelites' vie to express the sense of grandeur of Egypt. Many of the
most successful painters and paintings of the age were Egyptian-minded;
Gustave Moreau, Hans Makart, and Elihu Vedder's 'Man Questioning the Sphinx'
of 1863. Sir Edward Poynter's epic vision of forced labour, 'Israel in
Egypt', is pure Hollywood and too exhausting to look at for more than a
minute at a time. Images of Cleopatra have a separate section in which the
supreme horror is Cabanel's Salon painting of Cleopatra trying out poisons
on her slaves. Fascinating, too, to see the notorious sado-erotic shocker of
1865, Federico Faruffini's 'Sacrifice of an Egyptian Virgin to the Nile'.
Luc-Olivier Merson's 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt' is another impressively
awful example of a painter taking Egypt seriously. In fact it is a copy made
in 1880, the year after the original had enraptured visitors to the Paris
Salon. On a moonlit night, Joseph lies flat out on the sands and the Virgin
Mary sleeps between the paws of the Sphinx. The unearthly radiance emanating
from the Christ Child in her arms inspired the novelist JK Huysmans to dub
the picture, 'Virgin and Sphinx, Jesus and mayonnaise.'
Egyptomania continues at the Louvre until April 18, sponsored by Fondation
Electricite de France. It then travels to Ottawa and Vienna.
