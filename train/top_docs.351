   An 11-year-old Californian, the youngest pilot to
fly the Atlantic, stepped from the cockpit Thursday with a huge
grin on his freckled face. He was greeted by champagne toasts and a
proud but worried mother.
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' said Christopher Lee
Marshall, weary but beaming, as he stood on the wing of his
single-engine Mooney 252 aircraft at Le Bourget, the same airfield
where Charles Lindbergh completed the first solo transatlantic
flight in 1927.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
Gail Marshall of Oceana, Calif., who waved an American flag and
handed Christopher a new stuffed bear.
   His old stuffed bear Charles Lindbeargh, cuddly and blue with
aviator's helmet and goggles, accompanied him on the long flight.
   ``Charles Lindbergh was one of my heroes,'' the young aviator
told reporters. ``So we decided on this trip, then next year
hopefully around the world.''
   He still wore his bright blue flight suit, with a baseball cap
reading ``Chris Marshall Tour'' covering his straw-colored hair, as
he sipped cola at a champagne and soft-drink reception inside an
airport hangar.
   Unlike Lindbergh, Christopher made several stops between New
York and Paris _ in Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland _ and
had company and emergency help from retired Navy pilot Randy
Cunningham, 46. Their trip started in San Diego on July 7.
   ``I didn't want to take an 11-year-old boy and make him fly for
20 hours straight,'' Cunningham said. ``I had a hard enough time
having him fly eight hours a day and keeping him awake. You know an
11-year-old boy wants to go to sleep when he gets tired.''
   Christopher's mother and friends who helped plan the trip said
they did not know who the previous youngest pilot to fly the
Atlantic might have been, but they were confident no one younger
had done it.
   Cunningham said the youngster, who will enter fifth grade this
fall, is ``a very talented pilot. He flies better than some of the
adults I've flown with.''
   He first went into a cockpit when he was 4 years old _ with his
father, an airline pilot _ and began flying with an instructor when
he was 7.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to fly across the United
States, but the record already has been broken. Christopher said he
was glad even younger kids have followed his example.
   ``I'm an ambassador to the youth of America, and I'm showing all
kids across America that they can go out and accomplish their
dreams,'' he said.
   The scariest moment of the flight came early Wednesday, when the
plane's oil pressure fell and its engine began overheating in bad
weather between Greenland and Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Cunningham took the controls for the return to the southeast
coast of Greenland and had to pick his way through mountains to a
small airfield at Kulusuk, where clouds were just 100 feet off the
ground.
   ``Only one of a million pilots could have made that landing and
he did,'' Christopher said. ``We came so close to dying.''
   ``I didn't think we'd make it through. We had to fly at 50 feet
off the ground, because there were mountains and it was
quarter-mile visibility and all the ocean was iced up. It was
neat.''
   The former Navy pilot said Christopher was not exaggerating the
danger they had faced.
   ``I went back in the clouds and came back down and then went
back around the mountains for about 20 minutes, trying to find the
runway desperately,'' he said. ``I didn't think I was going to
live.''
   Because Cunningham only flew the plane while it was
backtracking, he and Christopher both consider the youngster to
have been the pilot for a complete transatlantic crossing.
   Mrs. Marshall said she worried throughout the voyage, while
waiting at a Paris hotel room, but didn't realize until later how
frightening the experience could be for her son.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.
   After engine repairs in Greenland, Christopher took the controls
again for the flight to Reykjavik, then on to Glasgow, Scotland,
where they stayed Wednesday night before the final leg to Paris.

   An 11-year-old California boy bidding
to fly the Atlantic in a single-engine plane arrived in this
western Scottish port city Wednesday night from Iceland.
   Christopher Lee Marshall said he plans to leave for Paris
Thursday morning to complete his journey and become the youngest
pilot to cross the Atlantic.
   The boy, from Oceano, Calif., started his flight in San Diego,
Calif., July 7. He said he hoped to reach Le Bourget airport
outside Paris at 11 a.m. (5 a.m. EDT). Le Bourget is where Charles
Lindbergh completed his historic solo crossing in 1927.
   Christopher and Randy Cunningham, a 46-year-old retired U.S.
Navy pilot who is accompanying the boy, don't regard the feat
accomplished until they reach Paris, following Lindbergh's
tradition. The two stayed overnight at a Glasgow hotel.
   Earlier Wednesday, Christopher landed his Mooney 252 aircraft at
Reykjavik, Iceland's capital, after flying about 450 miles from
Kulusuk on Greenland's southeast coast in 2 hours, 15 minutes.
   On arrival at Reykjavik, Christopher said the flight was
pleasant but he was frightened Tuesday over Greenland when he was
forced to return to Kulusuk because of problems with low oil
pressure and an overheated engine.
   He said he flew the plane all the time but needed Cunningham's
expert skills and knowledge to advise him on landing in Greenland.
   Asked why he was doing it, the boy said: ``I want to get kids
all over the world to accomplish their dreams.''
   Christopher has his teddy bear in the plane's back seat.
   ``He (the bear) doesn't like to sit in the back but I throw him
farther back if he starts complaining,'' he said.
   Cunningham limits Christopher's daily flying time to eight
hours. He stopped in St. Louis, New York and Montreal before flying
to Greenland.
   Last year Christopher became the youngest pilot to cross the
United States, a record that has since been broken by 9-year-old
Tony Aliengena.

he would look at material sent to him.;   In her second public plea to Florio
in 16 months, Anna Hauptmann said she wants a chance to convince him that her
husband did not kidnap and murder 20-month-old Charles Lindbergh Jr. in 1932.;
  "My husband was never, never near the Lindbergh home," Hauptmann told a news
conference at the Union Hotel, where reporters and jurors stayed during the
trial. "They killed an innocent man.";   She said she was with her husband the
night of the kidnapping.;   "We didn't even know there was a kidnapping until
the next day," she said.;   Hauptmann went to the electric chair April 3,
1936, about four years after the boy was abducted from the Lindbergh home near
Hopewell. The child's body was discovered in a shallow grave near the home.
Hauptmann, a German immigrant, maintained his innocence to the end.;   "The
trial of the century was probably the greatest fraud in the history of this
country," said Robert Bryan, the San Francisco attorney who represents Anna
Hauptmann.;   Bryan said hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and lost
trial evidence prove that the trial was filled with misrepresentations and
fraud, that evidence was suppressed, that witnesses lied and that testimony

   An 11-year old who is trying to become the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot had to postpone his dream Sunday when a voltage regulator on his plane started acting up. 

   Christopher Lee Marshall, who wants to emulate Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight to Paris, arrived in Montreal from New York City Saturday aboard his Mooney 252 two-seater. 

   The young aviator from Oceana, Calif., was scheduled to fly to Greenland Sunday, then stop in Iceland before arriving in Paris on Wednesday. 
He began his trip Thursday in San Diego. 

   But Chris' co-pilot, Randy (Duke) Cunningham, flew the plane to Danbury, Conn., Sunday to have the voltage meter repaired.

   An 11-year-old aviator who plans to emulate
Charles Lindbergh's flight to Paris arrived in New York with a bit
of a scare.
   Christopher Lee Marshall was piloting his Mooney 252 two-seater
toward busy La Guardia Airport on Friday evening when the plane's
electrical power _ and radio _ went dead.
   ``I thought we might get in trouble if we can't call the
tower,'' Chris said later.
   But the power outage lasted only about 10 seconds and he landed
safely.
   ``I thought it was neat to land at a big airport,'' the Oceano,
Calif., boy said.
   Chris, who is accompanied by a former Navy pilot, hopped across
the country from San Diego to Kerrville, Texas, then to St. Louis
and New York.
   Today _ if the plane's electrical problems are sorted out _ he
and his companion planned to head toward Europe. His flight plan
calls for stops in Montreal, Greenland and Iceland.
   ``I want to show all other kids across America that if I can do
this trip, they can do this trip,'' Chris said Friday at Lambert
Airport in St. Louis before taking off for New York.
   Chris, the son of a commercial pilot, first took the controls of
a plane at age 4, and began flying with an instructor at 7.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
before completing his 33{-hour, non-stop solo flight across the
Atlantic to Paris in 1927.
   Last year, Chris became the youngest flier to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris, who will be a fifth-grader this fall, said this trip
would make him the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot. He is
accompanied by Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, 46, a retired commander
at Miramar Naval Air Station, Calif., and Vietnam War pilot.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
Chris' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But Chris
has done all of the flying, Cunningham said.
   The two flew to Texas in a borrowed plane, then traded it for a
new aircraft that was built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
   Because Cunningham is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the flight will be stretched out over
five days.
   ``He's doing good; he's a tiger,'' Cunningham said. ``He was
sick on the flight from Texas, but he flew right through it. He's
got around 270 hours of flying time in and he's very responsive.
Tell him to do something and he does it.''
   Chris' mother, Gail Marshall, founded a company that raised
money to pay for the flight.

   An 11-year-old boy accompanied by a retired
Navy pilot ace today flew off on his quest to retrace Charles A.
Lindbergh's historic flight to Paris, a 7,000-mile journey.
   Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, Calif., and Randy
Cunningham, 46, departed from Montgomery Field at 8:32 a.m. today
on the first leg of their trip to Kerrville, Texas.
   The two, flying the first leg in a borrowed plane, will trade it
for a new Mooney 252 aircraft built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
Takeoff was originally scheduled for Monday, but was delayed by
storms in Texas.
   In 1927, Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, Mo., then
to New York City before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo
flight across the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.
   Because Cunningham is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the trip will stretch out over five
days and include stops in Kernville; St. Louis, Mo.; New York;
Montreal; Sondestrom, Greenland, and Reykjavik, Iceland.
   According to Chris, the flight to Paris would make him the
world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot.
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said shortly before takeoff. ``I am an
ambassador to the youth of America, and I want to show all the
youth that if I can do my dreams, anyone can.''
   He said ``trying to stay awake'' would probably be the most
difficult part, ``but I will.''
   ``I'm not going to touch the controls unless there's an
emergency. Chris' aviation skills are phenomenal,'' Cunningham
said. The youngster has logged 200 hours, compared to Cunningham's
more than 7,000 miles.
   Chris, the son of a commercial air pilot, gained fame last
August when at age 10 he became the youngest aviator to fly across
the United States.
   In April, however, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., Tony Aliengena, broke the record by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris and his mother, Gail Marshall, who live about 15 miles
south of San Luis Obispo in central California, recruited
Cunningham for this trip after meeting him at an air show last year.
   Cunningham, a retired Miramar Naval Air Station, Calif.,
commander, was the only Navy pilot ace in the Vietnam War and is
the most-decorated Navy pilot, a Navy spokesman in San Diego said.

   Eleven-year-old pilot Chris Marshall took off
from New York Saturday on a trip to Europe, just like his hero,
Charles Lindbergh _ but with a few stops and a grown-up co-pilot.
   Bad weather and a thorough mechanical inspection of his Mooney
252 two-seater delayed the takeoff from La Guardia Airport until 5
p.m.
   ``I want to show all the kids in North America that if I can do
this trip, then they can achieve their dreams too,'' Chris said
after arriving at his first stop along the way, Montreal.
   He arrived in New York on Friday evening after a disconcerting
moment when the electrical system shut down for 10 seconds during
his approach.
   Chris landed safely, though, and all systems were go Saturday _
onboard video cameras were suspected of having drained the
batteries on Friday.
   Chris, of Oceano, Calif., has flown from San Diego to Texas to
St. Louis to New York. He plans stops in Montreal, Greenland and
Iceland on his way to Paris.
   Though space was at a premium because of emergency gear required
for flights over the North Atlantic, Chris made room for his
stuffed bear, outfitted with goggles, named ``Charles Lindbeargh.''
   The fifth-grader, the son of a commercial pilot, is also
accompanied by Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, 46, a retired Miramar
Naval Air Station, Calif., commander and pilot in the Vietnam War.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
Chris' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But Chris
has done all of the flying, Cunningham said. The boy's flight time

   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old California boy today
became the youngest pilot to cross the Atlantic, landing at the
Paris airport where Charles Lindbergh completed a historic solo
crossing in 1927.
   Christopher Lee Marshall touched down his single-engine plane at
Le Bourget airport on a flight from Glasgow, Scotland, where he
spent the night.
   The boy aviator was greeted by his mother as he stepped from the
plane wearing a bright blue flight suit and a baseball cap with a
sign reading ``Chris Marshall Tour.''
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' he said, grinning ear-to-ear
but looking tired.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
Gail Marshall, who waved an American flag and clutched a stuffed
bear intended as a present for her son.
   The young aviator from Oceano, Calif., then kissed his mother.
   Christopher started his flight in San Diego on July 7. He was
accompanied by retired Navy pilot Randy Cunningham, 46, who limited
Marshall's flying time to eight-hour stretches.
   A champagne and cola reception was held in the hangar of the
airport, north of Paris.
   Despite the trans-Atlantic venture, which included stops in St.
Louis, New York, Montreal, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland,
Christopher revealed his youth.
   On stepping from the plane, his first words to his mother were:
``I have to go to the toilet.'' He disappeared briefly then
returned to pose for photographers.
   At one point, Christopher re-entered the aircraft to produce his
old stuffed bear, from which he has said he is inseparable.
Photographers snapped pictures of Christopher with the cuddly
animal in its goggles and helmet and bearing a sign with its name
``Charles Lindbeargh.''
   Christopher arrived in Glasgow Wednesday night after an 840-mile
flight from Reykjavik, Iceland in his single-engine Mooney 252
aircraft.
   He arrived in Reykjavik early Wednesday after flying about 450
miles from Kulusuk on Greenland's southeast coast in 2 hours 15
minutes.
   The arrival in Paris was delayed by one day due to engine
troubles Wednesday that forced the plane back to Greenland.
   Cunningham said he took over the controls to fly the plane 50
miles back to Greenland after engine trouble and bad weather with
low visibility made the situation critical.
   He said it was the only time during the flight that he took
control of the aircraft.
   Cunningham said he had trouble finding the air field at Kukusuk,
an island of Greenland's southeast coast: ``We would have had to
ditch at sea. I didn't think I was going to live.''
   The oil filter cap had rattled loose so the oil pressure
plummeted and the engine overheated.
   Christopher's mother said her son began flying with his father
at the age of 4 and began training with an instructor at age 7.
   She said she was worried by the problems Wednesday.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday rejected
efforts by the wife of Bruno Richard Hauptmann to clear his name in
the 1932 kidnapping-murder of the son of aviator Charles Lindbergh
   In a one-sentence statement, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here affirmed a September 1987 ruling by U.S. District
Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. in Trenton.
   Robert R. Bryan, the attorney of Anna Hauptmann, vowed to take
his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are undaunted,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
San Francisco office. ``Our goal remains the same: to clear her
husband's name during her life.''
   Mrs. Hauptmann, 89, lives in Yeadon, Pa.
   Her husband was convicted in the March 1, 1932, kidnapping and
murder of the 20-month-old son of Lindbergh and his wife, Anne
Spencer Morrow Lindbergh, from their East Amwell Township, N.J.,
estate.
   Hauptmann was convicted following a sensational trial in
Flemington, N.J. that earned international attention, and was
executed April 3, 1936, at Trenton State Prison.
   Mrs. Hauptmann charged in a federal lawsuit that the case
against her husband should be reopened. The legal action was based
on new evidence Bryan said he uncovered, including more than 22,000
pages of documents and lost trial evidence found three years ago in
the garage of the late Harold G. Hoffman, New Jersey's governor at
the time of the trial and execution.
   The lawsuit claimed that the trial was riddled with
mispresentations and fraud, evidence was suppressed, witnesses were
coerced or lied on the state and testimony was changed.

<TEXT>
   David T. Wilentz, who gained worldwide
attention in 1935 when he prosecuted Bruno Richard Hauptmann for
the kidnap and murder of the Lindbergh baby, has died at age 93.
   Wilentz, the father of state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert
N. Wilentz, died ``peacefully in his sleep'' Tuesday night at his
summer home in Long Branch, said Anne Riegle, a family spokeswoman.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean said Wilentz's death ``marks the passing of
a figure and personality of near legendary proportions.''
   His death came hours after a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia rejected the most recent effort of Hauptmann's widow,
Anna, to clear her husband's name.
   Born in Dwinsk, Latvia, on Dec. 21, 1894, Wilentz came to the
United States at age 6 and became a naturalized citizen in 1900.
   As a young state attorney general, he handled his first criminal
case when he prosecuted Hauptmann in what became known as ``the
trial of the century.''
   Hauptmann was convicted of kidnapping the 20-month-old son of
aviator Charles Lindbergh from his East Amwell estate and then
murdering the child. He was executed April 3, 1936, at Trenton
State Prison.
   The trial was followed worldwide and journalist H.L. Mencken
called it ``the biggest event since the Resurrection.'' Wilentz,
who personally opposed the death penalty, was noted during the
trial for his eloquence.
   Some students of the case and Mrs. Hauptmann continue to claim
Hauptmann was innocent and was railroaded during the trial.
   After a decade as attorney general, Wilentz, whose main home was
in Perth Amboy, served as chairman of the state Democratic
Committee.
   Although he considered running for governor, he later told
friends he decided that New Jersey at that time would not elect a
Jewish governor.
   Wilentz went on to found one of the most prominent and powerful
law firms in the state. He also was the former director of the
board of Amerada Hess Corp.
   Despite his advancing age, Wilentz continued to report for work
frequently at the family's Woodbridge law firm, and he had spent
some time working at the firm Tuesday.
   ``He was active from the time he was admitted to practice law in
1919 right to the present,'' Ms. Riegle said.
   She said funeral arrangements were pending.
   Wilentz is survived by his wife, Lena; sons Robert and Warren;
and his daughter Norma Hess.

<TEXT>
   Author A. Scott Berg will write a biography of
Charles A. Lindbergh, authorized by the pioneering aviator's widow,
the Putnam Berkley Group announced Thursday.
   ``Impressed by the thoroughness, objectivity and compassion of
his previous works, Anne Morrow Lindbergh has granted A. Scott Berg
complete access to the heretofore restricted Charles A. Lindbergh
collections at Yale University and the Missouri Historical
Society,'' said Mrs. Lindbergh's attorney, James W. Lloyd.
   The 83-year-old widow of the man who first flew solo from the
United States to France also granted Berg access to her personal
papers.
   The permission is valid until the year 2000. Access to the
Lindbergh collections by other researchers will be restricted while
Berg completes his biography, the publisher said.
   ``Charles Lindbergh has been idolized and demonized ... and the
truth remains to be revealed,'' said Berg. ``In the end, I feel a
great life story will emerge _ one whose values are not only timely
but also timeless.''
   G.P. Putnam's Sons will publish the Lindbergh book in hardcover
in the fall of 1997. A paperback edition will be issued by Berkley
Books the following year.
   Berg graduated from Princeton University in 1971 and spent the
next seven years expanding his senior thesis on Maxwell Perkins
into the biography, ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,'' which won
the American Book Award.
   His most recent book was the bestseller ``Goldwyn: A
Biography,'' published last year.

   The Navy's oldest civilian engineer retired
Friday, after a career that spanned two world wars and included a
stint helping Charles Lindbergh design the pontooned planes he flew
to China.
   Rudy Ries, 89, was honored during ceremonies at the Naval
Training Systems Center for his achievement of being the oldest
full-time civilian employee in the Navy.
   ``You've been an inspiration to us all,'' said Capt. C.D. Rowley,
commanding officer of the Naval Training Systems Center, as he
presented Ries with a number of certificates, letters of
commendation and a plaque. ``We are all proud you were one of us.''
   In a letter read to Ries, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III
thanked him for his 26 years of dedicated service.
   When the German-born Ries joined the German Air Force in 1916,
World War I had ended before he could become a fighter pilot. In
1928, he saw the onset of Naziism in his country and came to America
as a mechanical engineer.
   Ries began his latest career in 1963 and might have continued in
his job, he said in an interview, if his wife, Julia, hadn't died
last year and if the nature of his engineering work hadn't changed.
   He's a hands-on engineer and much of today's engineering is just
paperwork, Ries said. In effect, he said, they've taken away his
drafting board.
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   He described the reams of specifications turned out by today's
engineers as ``letters to Santa Claus.''
   In earlier years, Ries worked with Lindbergh and Adm. Richard
Byrd in designing pontoons for the planes they flew to China and the
South Pole.
   He worked first for Fairchild Aviation and then Merganthaler
Linotype Co. before joining EDO Aircraft on Long Island in 1930. He
became an American citizen in that year.
   It was at EDO that he worked with Lindbergh and Byrd.
   ``Lindbergh and his wife were flying to China and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' Ries said.
   The Lindbergh's returned to EDO aircraft after their flight to
China and had lunch with Ries and other company officials. ``I
loaned him my pocketknife to cut his onions with, and I've still got
that knife,'' Ries said.
   He helped design one of the world's first high-altitude metal
planes, was a consultant in the Ukraine to Soviet builders of the
American-designed PBY flying boat and worked for the Fokker Aircraft
Co. in the Netherlands before the Germans invaded Poland,
precipitating World War II.
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators to explode
Tomahwak and Harm missiles when they fail to detonate in combat and
maneuvers. He is also responsible for the design of a training aid
for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50.
   He said he intends to keep active when he returns to his native
Germany to live with his son and family in Bonn. His son, Eric Ries,
is a civil engineer with the State Department there.

   The Navy's oldest civilian employee, an
89-year-old engineer, has retired and is going back to Germany,
where he launched a career in aviation that spanned six decades.
   Rudy Ries came to this country in 1928 and worked for 35 years
for companies that pioneered in aviation: Fairchild, Convair,
Martin, EDO Aircraft and for Fokker in the Netherlands. He helped
design pontoons for the planes flown by Charles Lindbergh to China
and by Adm. Richard Byrd to the South Pole.
   ``I've enjoyed my work, all of it,'' he said sadly at a
retirement ceremony at the Naval Training Systems Center on Friday.
``I will miss it.''
   He said he would fly to Bonn, West Germany, this weekend to live
with his son, a civil engineer posted with the U.S. State Department
there.
   The diminutive, soft-spoken Ries worked ``only'' 26 years for the
Navy Department, starting in 1963.
   Born in Frankfurt, he joined the German air force during World
War I, but he hadn't completed pilot training when it ended. In
1928, he saw the onset of Nazism in his country and came to America.
   He became a citizen in 1930, the year he joined EDO on New York's
Long Island.
   ``Lindbergh and his wife were flying to China and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' Ries said.
   The Lindberghs returned to EDO after their flight to China and
had lunch with Ries and other company officials.
   ``I loaned him my pocket knife to cut his onions with, and I've
still got that knife,'' Ries said.
   Another highlight of his two stints at EDO was the design of an
all-metal airplane designed to operate at 30,000 feet, a two-seater
named the Model-R in his honor. The Depression caused the company to
cut back work on it and the Model-R was never flown.
   In 1936, Ries went to work for Consolidated Aircraft in
California, which later became Convair.
   From there, he and 20 other engineers and assistants were sent to
the Soviet Union to help in setting up an assembly plant. After
spending more than a year in the Ukraine, he got a job at Fokker
Aircraft Co. in Amsterdam. But Ries' European stay was cut short
with the approach of World War II, and he returned to this country.
   A hands-on mechanical engineer, he admitted frustration with his
profession's increasing reliance on paperwork, which he called
``letters to Santa Claus.''
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators for the
controllers who explode Tomahawk and Harm missiles when they fail to
detonate or go off course. He also is responsible for the design of
a training aid for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50, which
can be dropped from an airplane or fired from land or ships at sea.

<HEAD>Young Pilot Resumes Flight To Paris After Stop For Plane Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old pilot left Montreal Monday on the
next part of his San Diego to Paris journey after his plane was
grounded for a day by mechanical trouble.
   Christopher Lee Marshall left Dorval airport at 2:42 p.m. EDT
headed for Wabush, Labrador, in a single-engine Mooney 252
two-seater, said Doug McGurk, a Transport Canada spokesman.
   The boy from Oceano, Calif., has said the trip will make him the
world's youngest transatlantic pilot and he wants to make the trip
to emulate Charles Lindberg's 1927 flight to Paris. One of his
other goals is to become the youngest pilot to fly around the world.
   The fifth-grade student and son of a commercial pilot is
accompanied by Randy Cunningham, 40, a retired pilot who served in
the Vietnam war. Cunningham limits the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a stretch.
   They are scheduled to fly to Greenland and Iceland before
arriving in Paris. The trip began in San Diego last Thursday.
   They had been scheduled to leave Montreal Sunday but were unable
to take off because a voltage regulator aboard the plane had to be
repaired.
   McGurk said the flight from Montreal to Wabush, at 21,000 feet,
would take nearly four hours.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo flight across the
Atlantic Ocean to Paris.
   Christopher first took the controls of a plane at age four and
began flying with an instructor three years later.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.

<TEXT>
   Imagine a brash astronaut thumbing his nose
at the space agency and taking an old Mercury spacecraft all the
way to the moon, then claiming it was a mistake, and you get a
glimmer of Douglas ``Wrong Way'' Corrigan's feat 50 years ago.
   ``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way,'' Corrigan
claimed on July 18, 1938, after making a forbidden New
York-to-Dublin flight in a used Curtiss-Robin monoplane on which
he'd spent $900. Plus $90 for gas and oil.
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of Long Beach, Calif., after federal aviation authorities
denied him permission to fly to Ireland.
   But Corrigan, now 81 and living in Santa Ana, Calif., hinted in
a telephone interview last week that his wrong-way explanation may
change after he flies again to Dublin on Sunday, this time as an
honored guest for three days of ceremonies commemorating his flight.
   ``Maybe this time over in Dublin, I'll tell them another story.
We'll see,'' he said Thursday.
   Corrigan's ``wrong-way'' explanation sounded like pure blarney
at the time _he was made a lifetime member of the Liars Club _ but
America and Ireland loved it.
   He was the overnight guest of the U.S. ambassadors in Dublin and
London. After he returned to New York by ship, with his plane in a
crate, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was even a meeting
with President Franklin Roosevelt.
   A movie was turned out by RKO Studios,``The Flying Irishman,''
starring Corrigan as himself, and there were magazine articles and
an autobiography, ``That's My Story.'' He estimated he grossed
$85,000 from tours and speeches.
   As punishment for his journey, the Bureau of Air Commerce,
forerunner of the Federal Aviation Administration, suspended
Corrigan from flying for five days. Those five days were served
while he was still aboard ship on the way home.
   Whatever the true story, Corrigan had joined the ranks of his
hero, Charles Lindbergh, and Wiley Post by making a solo, nonstop,
single-engine crossing of the Atlantic.
   He also dispelled the notion that air feats were only for
millionaires and well-financed aviators.
   When Corrigan was 20, he was a woodworker at Ryan Aircraft in
San Diego and helped build Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis for the
1927 New York-to-Paris solo trans-Atlantic flight.
   Corrigan got his pilot's license the next year. He bought a
leather flight jacket just like Lindy's, scraped his money together
and studied navigation.
   He bought his monoplane for $310 in 1931, and spent an
additional $590 modifying it into a long-distance machine. Before
the flight to Ireland, he flew from Long Beach to New York nonstop
in 27 hours on July 7-8.
   Then the Bureau of Air Commerce refused to grant permission for
a trans-Atlantic flight, on grounds his plane, loaded with 330
gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was 55 percent too
heavy for a safe flight.
   Corrigan took off from New York's Floyd Bennett Field on July
17, saying he was headed for Long Beach. He landed at Dublin 28
hours and 13 minutes later, 3,150 miles from New York.
   ``There had been a haze near the ground and when I was 500 feet
high, there was fog below the plane,'' Corrigan once said of his
flight. ``When I started to turn west I noticed the top compass was
not working right, due to the liquid having leaked out. ... There
was another compass down on the floor that I had set to fly a
westerly course, so now I turned the plane until the parallel lines
matched, and flew over the fog.''
   The wrong way.
   He had no radio and his $1 wristwatch stopped. ``The only modern
instrument I had was a turn-and-bank indicator,'' said Corrigan,
who subsisted on fig and chocolate bars and some water during his
flight.
   ``I knew I wasn't in Long Beach when I dropped out of the
overcast over Dublin,'' he said. ``The place was greener and some
of the houses had hay roofs.''
   Corrigan will be the guest of Aer Lingus on Sunday when the
Irish airline takes him to Dublin aboard a Boeing 747.
   ``We offered him a first-class seat, but he said he would prefer
to fly economy,'' said Aer Lingus spokesman Bill Maxwell in Dublin.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't quite Lindbergh, but a Texas university
professor earned his footnote in aviation history Tuesday when he
completed the first trans-Atlantic flight in an ethanol-fueled
airplane.
   Max Shauck, a mathematics instructor at Baylor University in
Waco, Texas, landed at the small Toussus-le-Noble airport southwest
of Paris after a one-hour flight from Tours.
   He set out with Italian co-pilot Grazia Zanin from Waco on Sept.
15 in a light experimental aircraft that carried them through often
rough weather to Canada, the Azores, Portugal, Spain and finally
France.
   ``We feel we have proved that ethanol is a very reliable fuel,''
Shauck said. ``You can't get across the Atlantic on an unreliable
fuel.''
   Proving the merits of the relatively cheap, non-polluting
ethanol compared to standard fuel drove Shauck make the journey,
which he funded himself at more cost ``than I care to think about.''
   Ethanol is essentially an alcohol fuel made from vegetable
matter, usually corn in the United States and sugar beets in
Europe. Shauck, who also does air pollution research at Baylor,
says ethanol retails for about $1.20 per gallon in the United
States compared to $1.80 for high-octane aviation fuel.
   ``It produces more power, it burns cooler and there's a lot less
pollution,'' he said. ``But we had to go out of our way sometimes
to find it.''
   Indeed, Shauck and Zanin's flight log includes a hodgepodge of
small stopovers in North America chosen chiefly because ethanol
could be delivered there.
   These included Paducah, Ky.; Newark, Ohio; Hazelton, Pa.; and
Suffolk, N.Y. The plane also stopped at Shauck's hometown of
Mansfield, Ohio.
   In Canada, they stopped at Moncton and St. Pierre-et-Miquelon
before lifting off from St. John's, Newfoundland on Oct. 20 for
Flores in the Azore Islands, a 2,000-mile crossing made terrifying
by rain and thunderstorms.
   ``It's a long way over a lot of water when you're flying a
little plane looking for little islands,'' he said. ``We didn't
have sophisticated navigation equipment.''
   They waited in the Azores for nearly three weeks for a shipment
of ethanol to arrive before flying to Lisbon Nov. 10. Shauck, 54,
and Ms. Zanin, 33, made stops in Bilbao, Spain, and Bordeaux,
Rochet-Sur-Yon and Tours in France.
   Technically, they became the first people to cross the Atlantic
in an ethanol-fueled plane the minute they touched down in
Portugal, but the original plan they filed with American
authorities was from Suffolk County, N.Y., airport to Paris.
   The fiberglass aircraft, a sort of flying wing built by the
Velocity Corp. of Sebastian, Fla., featured elevators, normally
found on the tail, at the front of the airplane and a propellor
mounted on the back.
   The whole contraption weighs about 2,100 pounds and can reach a
top speed of 200 mph.
   Shauck resists comparison with American aviator Charles
Lindbergh, first man to cross the Atlantic in a flight from New
York to Le Bourget airport in Paris on May 31, 1927.
   ``He is a hero,'' Shauck said. ``Everything now is different
than it was in his day. I avoided going to Le Bourget because I
didn't want to be compared to him.''
   Shauck said he would take a commercial flight back to Texas, but
that the aircraft will make one more trip _ to Ms. Zanin's
hometown, Trieste.

   The ticker tape parade Wednesday for Nelson
Mandela is the fifth in the last 10 years through New York's
``Canyon of Heroes'' on lower Broadway.
   There have been about twoscore such parades since Charles
Lindbergh was lionized here in 1927. Aviators, athletes and
warriors predominate.
   Among the notable parades:
   1986 _ New York Mets, after beating the Boston Red Sox in the
World Series.
   1985 _ 25,000 Vietnam veterans, led by Gen. William Westmoreland
and 26 Medal of Honor winners, in a 10-years-later welcome-home
tribute.
   1984 _ 221 athletes of the U.S. Olympic team are cheered, but
101 spectators are injured when a construction scaffold on the
parade route gives way.
   1981 _ Welcome home for the Americans hostages freed from Iran.
   1979 _ Pope John Paul II.
   1978 _ New York Yankees world champion team.
   1969 _ ``Miracle'' Mets world champion team.
   1969 _ Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first men
to land on the moon, and fellow Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins.
   1963 _ Astronaut Gordon Cooper.
   1962 _ Astronaut John Glenn, the first American in orbit.
   1958 _ Van Cliburn, the only classical musician ever to get the
ticker-tape treatment, after winning piano competition in Moscow.
   1951 _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur, after his recall from Korea by
President Truman.
   1938 _ Douglas ``Wrong-Way'' Corrigan, for his air flight to
Ireland while claiming his destination was Los Angeles.
   1938 _ Howard Hughes and his plane crew, for breaking Wiley
Post's round-the-world flight record.
   1936 _ Beryl Markham, for the first westward trans-Atlantic solo
flight, described later in her memoir ``West With the Night.''
   1928 _ Amelia Earhart, first woman to fly the Atlantic, as
navigator, before making her own solo flight some years later.
   1927 _ Lindbergh, after returning from solo flight to Paris.
   Several of the parades were larger in scope than the traditional
route from Bowling Green to City Hall, a canyon about 16 blocks
long formed by the office towers along Broadway in the financial
district.
   Glenn's parade, which wended through midtown as well as lower
Manhattan, produced the greatest fallout of paper in any ticker
tape parade, 3,474 tons, according to Sanitation Department records.
   The most paper generated by a canyon-only parade was 1,262 for
the Iran hostage parade.
   Official estimates of spectator numbers have been extravagant.
The Mets' 1986 parade was reported as drawing 2.2 million people.
That works out to 137,000 people per block, or enough to fill Shea
Stadium 2{ times.

   A bit of aviation history was made in this
city where Charles Lindbergh learned to fly.
   Twenty corporate aircraft, half of them the popular Learjets,
were put on the auction block Wednesday in a first-of-its-kind
event for the aircraft industry.
   ``This has never been done before in aviation, save for an
occasional bankruptcy sale and sales of smaller or antique
planes,'' said J. Robert Duncan, president of Duncan Aviation.
   The sale was also a first for Sotheby's, the international
auction house that specializes in fine art and antiques. John L.
Marion, the head of Sotheby's North American operations, wielded
the gavel.
   Within an hour, Duncan crews wheeled the aircraft, one-by-one,
through a clean aircraft hangar. There, Marion bellowed the
auctioneer's mantra: ``I have $2 million to start, I have 2
million.''
   When it was over, five airplanes had been sold for a total of
$7,927,750. Two others, including the most expensive one offered,
were snapped up before the sale, bringing the total to more than
$20 million, Marion said.
   Duncan, who heads the 30-year-old business aviation sales and
service with 550 employees in 14 cities, said he was pleased with
the sale, but had greater expectations.
   ``We'll analyze the results and evaluate whether or not we want
to make this an annual event. I think we might have another sale,''
he said.
   Prices paid ranged from $309,750 for a 1980 Piper Cheyenne I to
``about $14 million to $15 million'' for a 1988 Canadair Challenger
_ one of the two sold before the auction, Duncan said.
   Gary Conklin, a representative of Great Planes Sales Inc. of
Tulsa, Okla., picked up a Westwind 1124 for $2.1 million. He said
his company buys planes, renovates them and then looks for a buyer.
   The names of other buyers were not made public.
   Lindbergh studied flying at the old Lincoln School of Aviation
in the 1920s. He made his solo flight of the Atlantic in May 1927.

   In a cramped gondola dangling beneath
an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below,
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be
believed.
   ``You have crossed the coast of Ireland,'' the voice told three
American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago.
Larry Newman asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded
others for 105 years.
   Silence.
   Then, crisply, ``Sir, my radar is never wrong.''
   Newman, along with Ben Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson, whooped with
joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the
businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing
in a balloon.
   The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later
that day, Aug. 17, 1978, in a wheat field west of Paris.
   Today, Newman is the only one of the three still alive.
   Anderson was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed
in a West German forest during a race. Abruzzo, then 53, died in
1985 when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in
Albuquerque.
   Newman, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in Phoenix, Ariz.,
said he has no specific plans to celebrate Wednesday's anniversary.
   But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10
years ago.
   Newman recalled that after the initial jubilation, Anderson went
to sleep while he and Abruzzo looked down through the clearing
clouds on the lights of Dublin, Ireland.
   The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that
drifted skyward. Newman and Abruzzo could hear dogs barking and
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below.
   ``Tears came to my eyes,'' Newman said. ``I put my arm around
Ben _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I hadn't felt
that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.''
   The men began the flight six days earlier when the Double Eagle
II lifted up from Presque Isle, Maine, and headed toward Europe
more than 3,000 miles away.
   Newman says the flight was not without problems, including a
clash of personalities.
   ``Maxie Anderson later stated that he wished he could have flown
the flight by himself,'' Newman said. ``I don't know what Ben's
feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with. I didn't
want to be Charles Lindbergh.''
   Newman said conflicts arose when Anderson and Abruzzo both began
making key decisions.
   ``Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: Ben
Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson,'' he said.
   But Newman said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of
the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras
and navigational equipment. Newman's hang glider dangled beneath
the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over
the sides in bags.
   ``There were many times the flight was in question,'' Newman
recalled. ``But how close it came to failure at each moment was
interpreted different by each of us.''
   They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted
the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they
dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted.
   Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They
tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could.
   Newman said that at one point, a bit delirious from the
altitude, he chucked a $4,000 radio _ and only later noticed a jar
of peanut butter that weighed as much.
   Plans were for Newman to fly the glider down once they made it
to Paris.
   But 400 miles from Ireland, it came down to a choice of dropping
the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a
heater to battle Abruzzo's frostbite. The glider went.
   Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to
communicate by ham radio.
   ``The first guy I talked to wouldn't talk because I didn't have
a license,'' said Newman. ``And he didn't believe I was in a
balloon over the middle of the ocean.''
   Finally, Newman reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a
home for the elderly somewhere in England.
   ``His call sign was `G4JY.' I don't think I'll ever forget
that,'' he said. ``He talked to me until the last day of the
flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.''
   Newman said the rough times were offset by the excitement.
   A high point, he said, came over Ireland when a jumbo jet
relayed a message from the Smithsonian Institution. The museum had
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the National Air and
Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis and the Wright brothers' plane.
   In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to
Paris, where Lindbergh had landed 51 years before after the first
solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over Evreux, France, they
realized they could not go on.
   The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of
champagne. They were 60 miles west of Paris, 3,107 miles and 137
hours from Maine where the helium-packed balloon had taken off.
   The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola
settled gently to Earth as cheering spectators abandoned their cars
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon.
   Hundreds tried to take a piece of history.
   ``It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' Newman said. ``People
were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.''
   The French press dubbed them the ``new Lindberghs.''
   But Newman says the only time he thought about Lindbergh was
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would
sleep in Lindbergh's bed at the American ambassador's residence in
France.
   Newman and his wife won.
   ``And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I
couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``The bed was like a banana. The springs
were shot.''

   Chicago Star to Shine in East

   Chicago -- Within the next month, Denis O'Hare, a slightly
built, well-spoken young man of 30 years, should know whether
he has a future as a word processing temp.
   Word processing is Mr. O'Hare's day job at KPMG Peat
Marwick &amp; Associates here. Until recently, his night job was
playing the title role in the Victory Gardens Theater
production of "Hauptmann" by John Logan. The show played to
rapt audiences and was held over for several months. Mr.
O'Hare's uncertain employment future stems from the transfer
of that production to the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York,
where it is scheduled to begin previews on April 9 prior to
an April 16 opening. Mr. O'Hare, who will go into rehearsals
for the show before the end of the month, is hoping to do
well enough in the Big Apple to give up his days at the
computer keyboard forever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I have not seen Mr. O'Hare process words, but his
portrayal of Hauptmann in Chicago was electrifying. Nor was I
the only critic to gush. Mr. O'Hare's Hauptmann provoked
singular praise among local critics. His work was described
as "the performance of the year" by the Chicago Tribune. The
Sun-Times wrote that Mr. O'Hare had accomplished "A tour de
force that could hold its own on any stage in the world."
   "Hauptmann" recounts the sensational prosecution of the
German immigrant Bruno Richard Hauptmann for the kidnapping
of the legendary Lindbergh baby, infant son of the aviation
pioneer Charles ("Lucky Lindy") Lindbergh and the writer Anne
Morrow Lindbergh. Mr. O'Hare portrays the unsavory but not
necessarily guilty Hauptmann with sardonic petulance. As the
play opens, we hear the judge pronounce his guilt and
sentence him to death. What follows is a two-hour impression
of the events surrounding his capture, incarceration and
trial from Hauptmann's point of view, a view profoundly
affected by his imminent execution.
   Mr. O'Hare's Hauptmann is no innocent martyred on the
altar of American hero worship. He lies to his captors about
circumstantial evidence linking him to the Lindbergh ransom,
he lies to his wife, and we are never sure when he is lying
to us, the audience. In a transcendent scene, Hauptmann
chillingly recounts a version of the baby's kidnapping and
death. The story he tells recapitulates how the kidnapper may
have gained entry to the second-story Lindbergh nursery in
Hopewell, N.J., snatched the infant, and then accidentally
killed him during the getaway down the ladder.
   Mr. O'Hare's subtly etched portrayal serves as the frame
within which we view the Lindbergh kidnapping, a classic
American carnival of media excess and unfair, overwrought
legal process. Everybody from President Hoover to Al Capone
pledged to help bring the baby's kidnapper to hard justice.
Everybody was outraged when Hauptmann was apprehended but
failed to confess. We leave the theater without answers
concerning Hauptmann's guilt or innocence but moved by an
affecting portrayal of a man caught in the vortex of inflamed
national passions.
   Hauptmann is not Mr. O'Hare's first major role or villain.
He portrayed Nathan Leopold Jr., an admitted child kidnapper
and killer, in another play by Mr. Logan, "Never the Sinner."
He won an Emmy for his performance as a character based on
Richard Speck, the mass murderer of eight nurses, in the TV
special "Moment of Rage."
   Mr. O'Hare studied acting at Northwestern University's
School of Speech. "My acting classes taught me to wear black
turtlenecks and smoke," he recalls. "Acting classes can only
teach you how to perform. Don't get me wrong. I love
performers. Victor Borge does the same thing every time he
performs, and it's terrific. . . . I learned how to be an
actor in my non-acting classes studying literature, music,
poetry and architecture."
   Local success in his craft hasn't spoiled Mr. O'Hare.
O'Hare is a household word, but only as the name of the
city's main airport, and O'Hare the actor still has to round
out his income at the computer keyboard. When "Hauptmann"
opened, Mr. O'Hare, as the lead performer, received the
Actors Equity minimum rate of $335 a week, or an annualized
salary of less than $17,500. When the play was held over, his
weekly wage rose to $550. And that's about the limit he can
hope to earn if his portrayal of Hauptmann at the Cherry Lane
doesn't command the respect of the New York critics.
   All he really wants from the New York stint is the ability
to make it big in Chicago. Recognition in New York, even
short of rave notices, might make it possible for him to
become a full-time actor based here. "You can't be big in
Chicago until you leave and succeed in New York or
Hollywood," he says. "The big Chicago shows cast their leads
on either coast."
   At the moment Mr. O'Hare can compete for a title role at
Victory Gardens, but Chicago's major theater companies,
including the Goodman Theater and Steppenwolf, look for lead
actors with national reputations. So last year, Mr. O'Hare
took the bit part of Willie Oban in Eugene O'Neill's "The
Iceman Cometh," while the title role went to the movie actor
Brian Dennehy.
   Even some of Chicago's smaller companies attempt to ensure
strong box office by booking big names. Recently, the Body
Politic Theatre booked Hope Lange for its production of
"Homeward Bound." (She backed out just before rehearsals
began.) The Organic Theatre brought George ("Cheers") Wendt
back here for a revival of "Bleacher Bums."
   In the end it may not matter if Mr. O'Hare comes home from
New York wrapped in glory. He invested the raise he got for
"Hauptmann" in bulbs for the garden behind his house in the
modest Logan Square neighborhood. "If I can't support myself
as an actor," he says, "I'm going to give up word processing
and become a gardener."

Francis X. Fay, 91, the FBI agent who led the investigation into the celebrated 
Lindbergh kidnaping case. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1932 kidnaping, agents traced almost every dollar of the ransom money 
to Bruno Hauptmann, who was executed for kidnaping and murdering 20-month-old 
Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. Fay's other cases included the capture of the "Candy 
Kid" and one in which he posed as a surgeon to learn the identity of a wounded 
felon and principal of the notorious Tri-State Mob. He retired from the FBI 
after 13 years in 1935 and helped form the Society of Former Agents. He served 
as security director during a 30-year career at Macy's department store in New 
York. On Saturday in Torrance.

<HEAD>Police Baffled By Discovery Of Head on Golf Course</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grisly find on a country golf course has
police culling clues from around the nation, but so far detectives
are baffled about the identity of a woman whose head was discovered
lying along a brook.
   Police say they may have to use the lastest technology of modern
forensics to determine the victim's identity.
   ``We have nothing concrete,'' said Hopewell Township Police Lt.
Michael Chipowski. ``We've gotten dozens of calls about people who
haven't been seen for a while, but they haven't led anywhere.''
   Chipowski said the case has recently drawn more than 200 leads
and inquiries from across the nation.
   ``Probably nothing has stirred up such excitement here since the
Lindbergh case,'' Chipowski said, referring to the trial of Bruno
Hauptmann, who was convicted in a nearby courthouse of murdering
flying ace Charles Lindbergh's baby son a half century ago.
   ``This is certainly out of the ordinary. It's a real mystery,''
he said.
   The female human head was discovered March 5 by a golfer whose
errant shot sent him searching for his ball along the bank of a
brook at the Hopewell Valley Golf Club north of Trenton. Chipowski
said police believe the killing occurred just before the discovery
because there was fresh makeup on the head and ``the features were
in a good state.''
   ``We have about 30 leads yet to complete,'' said Chipowski.
``We'll run down every one of them.''

<DESCRIPT>  BOOK; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT WAS called the Crime of the Century even when the century was young, and
nearly 60 years later it still is. The 1932 kidnapping and subsequent death of
Charles and Anne Lindbergh's infant son from his second-floor nursery in New
Jersey had suspense, an innocent child victim, a fortune in lost ransom and a
fabulous cast of celebrity characters -- suspects, investigators, psychics,
opportunists.;    And conspiracy theories. Bruno Richard Hauptmann was
executed for the crime, but the Lindbergh case was marked by bad police work,
squabbling public agencies, personal ambition and greed. If Hauptmann was
innocent -- and the case against him was certainly flawed -- then it would
seem that almost anyone in America could have kidnapped Charles Lindbergh Jr.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But who did?;    Maybe only Nate Heller knows for sure. Heller's a
detective, the creation of a writer named Max Allan Collins, and he's appeared
in four other novels. But "Stolen Away: A Novel of the Lindbergh Kidnapping"
(Bantam Books, 516 pp., $22.50), is surely his finest hour.;    Heller is the
youngest plainclothesman on the Chicago police force, and in the early days
after the kidnapping, when Al Capone is still a suspect, Heller is sent off to
be Chicago's liaison with the New Jersey state cops.;    The case is a mess.
The Jersey cops have botched the fingerprinting and crime-scene investigation,
and they are not reporting to law enforcement officials, but to Lindy himself,
who knows a lot about aviation but nothing about police work. He considers his
servants above reproach, for example, and does not allow them to be
interrogated, despite evidence that there is an inside connection in the
kidnapping. Whenever there is a lead, Lindy keeps the cops on a leash; he
wants to pay the ransom and get his son back.;    Heller sees that Slim -- as
Lindbergh's friends call him -- can't win. He's trying to play by the rules in
a game run by cheaters.;    Heller is a likable gumshoe who reminds me of
Archie Goodwin, sidekick to Rex Stout's formidable Nero Wolfe. He's roughly
honest but no prig, smart but no genius, a great drinking partner and a
capable adversary. Of course, Goodwin had the genius Wolfe behind him. Heller
isn't so lucky.;    Working awkwardly with the inept police and with
interested Washington heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean -- a hot number, if there
ever was one -- Heller confronts a Gordian knot of clues and false leads.
There are three strings of suspects he can dismiss as crackpots or schemers,
except that each of these groups has some piece of information that only the
kidnapper could have. When Heller draws together a theory that explains
everything, a fellow investigator scoffs that things are becoming too
Byzantine. Heller replies, "If you'd care to point out any one part of this
case that has ever made rational sense, I'll slip on my raincoat and go home.
Right now.";    Heller's theory is cockeyed, as it turns out. But it's close
enough to trigger one last brilliant and astonishing revelation, a solution
that brings the book full circle and resonates right into the 1990s.;   
"Stolen Away" is a great suspense novel, backed by considerable research and
stylishly told in the fast, slangy style of the jazz age. Heller gets beat up
too often to be in the top rank of detectives, but Collins is certainly among
the elite of his craft.;  WESTERN CIVILIZATION: Douglas C. Jones' "The Search
for Temperance Moon" (Henry Holt, 324 pp., $22.50) is a rich elegy to
tumultuous Fort Smith, Ark., as its chapter of the Old West came to a fitful,
violent close at the end of the 19th century.;    Fort Smith, home of Isaac
Parker, the legendary "Hanging Judge," was the gateway to the Indian Nations,
the home in exile of the so-called Five Civilized Tribes -- Cherokee, Creek,
Choctaw, Chickasaw and Seminole. Civilized they may have been, in the dubious
sense that they had long been influenced by white ways, but the Nations were
far from civil. There was probably no more lawless place on earth.;    As
Jones writes of one character:;    Never having had the advantage of an
education at such places as Mrs. Sawyer's Female Seminary in Fayetteville,
Arkansas, Winona had learned the white man's talk from almost thirty years of
association with bootleggers, horse thieves, railroad roustabouts, Texas
cattle drovers, land speculators, Baptist evangelists, pimps, bank robbers,
and murderers. In short . . . she was a true daughter of the old Indian
Territory.;    If Winona Crowfoot is the corrupted, Temperance Moon is the
corrupt. Known as the Bandit Queen of the Indian Territory, Temperance --
daughter of a Protestant minister -- numbers a handful of true desperadoes
among her successive husbands. From one she's taken her last name and from
another a farm in Creek Nation that serves as a general headquarters for the
region's drunks, thieves and killers.;    Then Temperance Moon gets her head
shot off, and the likeliest suspect is found dead soon after. The U.S.
Marshal's office closes the case, but Jewel Moon, Temperance's daughter and
the proprietor of a whorehouse, pays former deputy Oscar Schiller in
greenbacks and cocaine to find out who killed her mother -- and why.;     As
Oscar and his hand-picked partners peel away the layers of guilt and sin,
Arkansan Jones paints an unforgettable picture of a colorful place and time.
His fine prose is never hurried, and, though the violence comes seldom and
suddenly, the air is ever heavy with menace.;    I've always liked Jones'
Westerns, but this is his best. That means it's as good as they get.;  THE
TRAGI-COMICS: Starfire, the comic-strip creation that is central in San
Franciscan Mary-Rose Hayes' romantic "Paper Star" (E.P. Dutton, 359 pp.,
$19.95), is an extra-terrestrial environmental superhero -- a little close
conceptually to Turner Broadcasting Systems' Saturday morning "Captain
Planet.";    A project to bring the sci-fi heroine alive in the movies unites
four friends: Vera Brown, the sometimes-obese creator of Starfire; "Saint"
(That's Sloane St. John Treadwell Jr.), who scripts the strip; Jo-Beth "J.B."
Feeney, tormented actress/model who is the inspiration and screen incarnation
of Starfire; and Arnie Blaize, a matinee idol who has sought in drugs relief
from his yearning for an identity. The four, all emotionally needy, fall into
the web of Victor Diamond, influential Hollywood producer, insidious
manipulator and -- just possibly -- Saint's father.;    I like these
characters. Vera, in particular, is vital and real, and refreshingly different
from the cookie-cutter heroines of much romantic fiction.;    But ultimately,
this book stands or falls with Starfire, the comic-strip creation. And Hayes
doesn't quite bring her off.;    When Saint and J.B. first see Vera's
pre-professional strips, they are convulsed with laughter, which doesn't seem
the right response to this kind of strip at all. Hours later, they part, and
Vera, initiating a three-way hug, says, "The Starfire Trio, right? Through
thick and thin." Now, considering that Saint and J.B. have only just heard of
Starfire, and that they happen to be up to their eyeballs in one fresh killing
and an old one, the cartoon character is an unlikely bonding agent.;    All
through "Paper Star," Hayes wants us to embrace Starfire as more than we can.
It's a shame, because the "real" people here, and much of the story, are
compelling.;  ' "Can you scare them, men like that?";    "When you put a gun
in their mouth, you can.";    "But would the police do that?";    "Evalyn, I
am the police." ';    -- From "Stolen Away"; by Max Allan Collins;  ' That was
the only conversation as they ate. And Tishacomsie took the food to her mouth
with delicate fingers as surely as did the men, without reserve, without any
thought that she was different from them, and all the while her dark gaze
fastened on Oscar Schiller's face like a cat looking at a caged bird. In fact,
both Indians sized up the white man, and Oscar Schiller reciprocated in kind.
With intense curiosity on both sides to ensure that everything was as it had
been in the past, that there was still trust between them. '; -- From "The
Search for Temperance Moon"; by Douglas C. Jones;  ' Now Saint stared
longingly at the bright porthole that might be hers and wished he could go
there and be held in her arms and be comforted and strengthened. He wanted to
lay his head on her breast and cry: This is a bad man, Vera, he's dangerous
and cruel and evil, I'm totally indebted to him -- and I think he might be my
father. What am I going to do? '; -- From "Paper Star"; by Mary-Rose Hayes  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  LOCAL; POLITIC; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  While the trains aren't likely to role before the next century, a classic
political battle is building this spring over the planned route of BART to San
Jose. Two of the chief protagonists are rivals on the board of supervisors,
Ron Gonzales and Zoe Lofgren. And with a set of public hearings scheduled this
month, the stakes are suddenly much bigger than ever before. Some of the smart
money says BART will follow the Southern Pacific route favored by Lofgren.
That means the trains will run south along Interstate 880, stop near the
Mercury News, and then tunnel underneath Fifth, Eighth or Tenth streets into
downtown. A key stop on this line would be at Japantown, which is of
considerable interest to the well-heeled investors in the Nihonmachi
development.;    You may remember, however, that Gonzales is pushing a route
along the Union Pacific tracks, which parallel Lundy Avenue. three miles to
the east. Gonzales has argued that this would benefit many more east San
Joseans. Transportation planners now have completed a study showing that the
Gonzales alternative would cost $280 million more and produce only 640 more
daily riders. But Gonzales aide Jude Barry told us that those numbers -- based
on one more station than needed -- overstate the difference. ""We don't feel
the UP route is unrealistically more expensive," said Barry. FYI: The Southern
Pacific route would spare the home of Lofgren. The Gonzales alternative --
which now involves a deep tunnel -- would pass within a block of her house on
South 14th Street.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A VOTRE SAINTE;    With the departure of Mayor Tom McEnery and his Irish
roots, the new foreign passion at San Jose City Hall is Normandy. Our
columnist Leigh Weimers reported last Friday that a contingent of city
officials led by Vice Mayor Pat Sausedo will leave for Normandy on a junket in
March. And Normandy will be the theme of this year's Silicon Valley Charity
Ball, which will be attended by a host of French officials. Among those
pursuing this new relationship is the the city's director of economic
development, Bill Claggett, who will be on the March tour. What isn't so
widely known is that Claggett's wife, Sunny, has been a paid cultural
consultant for Normandy in Silicon Valley. Sunny Claggett told us she has been
a liaison with the Charity Ball and has helped to set up an exhibition of
French art. She contended, however, that she and her husband keep their
interests separate. "We're very much attentive to that," she said. "I'm only
doing the cultural stuff, helping them put together parties." A postscript: A
few prominent local business leaders have been grumbling that the city hasn't
emphasized exports enough in establishing relationships with countries that
want Silicon Valley jobs.; A WICKED STORY; Some of you may have followed Gov.
Pete Wilson's let-them-drink-cake statement last month. Defending his plan to
slash welfare payments, Wilson said: "I'm convinced they'll be able to pay the
rent. They will have less for a six-pack of beer. I don't begrudge them the
six-pack of beer, but it's not an urgent necessity." While this has generally
escaped scrutiny because of the Persian Gulf war, the timing of this
declaration was curious: It came only days after the Wilson administration
designated its own "official inauguration brew": Pete's Wicked Ale, made by
Pete's Brewing Co. in Palo Alto. Is the Wilson administration, uh, swilling
out of both sides of the mouth? Maybe not. Most welfare recipients won't be
able to afford Pete's. Its amber-colored Wicked Ale sells for $5.99 a
six-pack, a wickedly Republican price.; HISTORY LESSON; Everyone following the
war in the Middle East by now has an impression of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf,
the American commander known as "Stormin' Norman." What isn't so widely known
are some of the ironies in his family history. Schwarzkopf's father, also H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, was the commander of the New Jersey State Police and the
prime investigator in the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932. Charles
Lindbergh, you may remember, was one of America's major isolationists before
World War II (although what he would think about the Iraqi war is only a
guess).;    In any case, the details of the Lindbergh case make fascinating
reading today. When police found what they believed to be the body of the
Lindbergh baby in a patch of woods, Schwarzkopf pere was every bit as
meticulously prepared as his son today. He issued a formal brief to the press.
And he had emergency phone lines laid to within 75 feet of the site as he
pursued what he called a "gang" that did the kidnapping. In February, 1935, a
few months after Schwarzkopf's son was born, Bruno Richard Hauptmann was
convicted of the murder. (box)  </TEXT>

   President Bush's highly publicized distaste for
broccoli will only increase consumption of the vitamin-rich
vegetable, one proponent says.
   ``It's wonderful stuff. We sell tons of it,'' said William
Quinn, produce manager for the Outpost Natural Foods supermarket.
   Asked if Bush's move to ban the vegetable from Air Force One's
larder might affect sales of broccoli, Quinn said: ``Yes, among our
customers, I think it will increase them.''
   ``The man can't enjoy one of the best fruits of the earth,''
piped in Harriet Behar, whose Sweet Earth Farm near Gays Mills in
southwestern Wisconsin markets about 15,000 broccoli plants
annually.
   Bush's thumbs-down for broccoli made headlines when he told
questioning reporters on Thursday, ``I do not like broccoli and I
haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat
it and I'm president of the United States and I'm not going to eat
any more broccoli.''

   Tommy Bengaff won $25,000 at a blackjack
table in Atlantic City, and forked out $23,000 of it on his
mother's 60th birthday bash.
   Melba Bengaff and 65 of her closest friends celebrated her
birthday in grand style in a Bellevue Avenue mansion.
   Her 25-year-old son laid on a five-piece band, 20 chauffeured
limousines and a $45-a-plate meal, put up five guests from New York
City at a hotel and arranged a family vacation on the Caribbean
island of Aruba.
   ``It's my mother's 60th birthday and she means the world to
me,'' Bengaff said. ``You only have one mom. Mom and I are like
brother and sister. I know if she had the money she'd do it for
me.''
   Bengaff, a $25,000-a-year manager at a grocery store in Cranston
and owner of King's West Bay Limousine Service, said that last
October ``it came into my mind that I wanted to do something big. I
just didn't know where or how big.''
   A three-hour visit at a blackjack table in Atlantic City on New
Year's Eve took care of the money problem.
   ``My father told me to save it or put into an IRA, not to spend
it on one night in Newport,'' Bengaff said.

   A social worker paid $3,000 for the
large wooden crate that was used to ship Charles Lindbergh's plane
back to the United States after his historic flight to Europe in
1927.
   Larry Ross, 38, of Canaan, Maine, the executive director of a
social service agency, said he is convinced the crate is
historically significant. He wants to renovate it as a summer
cottage.
   The crate has lain for years in woods near Contoocook, and has
been used by passers-by in search of free housing. It has windows
and a door, and at one time had electricity and a phone, but it has
fallen into disrepair in recent years.
   ``It's not an awful lot to look at,'' said Ross, who plans to
load up the crate early this week.
   Ross bought the crate from David Price Sr., who took possession
of it five years ago when he bought the land from the grandson of
Admiral Guy Burrage.
   Burrage's ship brought Lindbergh and the crate back to the
United States. They became friends, the aviator gave him the crate
and Burrage turned it into a summer cottage.
   Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean
from the United States to France in the Spirit of St. Louis.
   ``It struck me as a unique piece of Americana that has a certain
New England eccentricity to it,'' Ross said. ``Some people look at
me like, `Are you crazy?' Other people get a real charge out of
it.''

   Today is Wednesday, Jan. 24, the 24th day of 1990. There are 341
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Jan. 24, 1965, former British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill died in London at the age of 90.
   On this date:
   In 1848, James W. Marshall discovered a gold nugget at Sutter's
Mill in northern California, a discovery that led to the gold rush
of '49.
   In 1908, the first Boy Scout troop was organized in England by
Robert Baden-Powell.
   In 1916, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal income tax was
constitutional.
   In 1922, Christian K. Nelson of Onawa, Iowa, patented the Eskimo
Pie.
   In 1924, the Russian city of Petrograd was renamed Leningrad in
honor of the revolutionary leader, who had just died.
   In 1935, Bruno Hauptmann took the stand in his New Jersey trial
on charges of kidnapping and murdering the infant son of aviator
Charles Lindbergh.
   In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill concluded a wartime conference in
Casablanca, Morocco.
   In 1978, a crippled, nuclear-powered Soviet satellite plunged

<HEAD>San Diegans Seek Alternative to Cramped Lindbergh Field</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cramped and nerve-wracking airport and no
room to build a new one has San Diego in a tight spot.
   It's hard to imagine a more picturesque setting for an
international airport _ on a bayfront flanked by rolling hills,
glassy skyscrapers and the gray magnificence of a Navy fleet.
   But to pilots who are forced by downtown buildings to descend
steeply on approach to Lindbergh Field, the setting for the airport
serving the nation's sixth largest city is all wrong.
   ``It's the worst airport in the world,'' said Tom Carroll of the
Air Line Pilots Association.
   Some would call than an exaggeration, but a 1988 survey of 1,360
pilots found Lindbergh Field tied in fith place with Denver's
Singleton Airport as the least safe airport in the United States.
   Transportation planners and civic leaders, who eye the land that
Lindbergh sits on for downtown expansion, have spent 30 years
searching for a replacement. The most frequently discussed option
is to convert the Miramar Naval Air Station to a commercial or
joint-use airport.
   The Navy is adamantly opposed to any such plan.
   Unless an alternative is found by the turn of the century,
Lindbergh, built in 1928, could throw a wrench into the region's
robust economy.
   ``San Diego is running into an economic buzz saw if we wait any
longer,'' said Dan Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic
Development Corp.
   ``It's absolutely the toughest issue in San Diego,'' said Jack
Koerper, the director of special projects for the San Diego
Association of Governments, the regional planning agency conducting
the airport search.
   Squeezed onto 485 acres, Lindbergh is surrounded by San Diego
Bay, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, businesses, residential areas
and rolling hills.
   ``One pilot likened it to landing in a shoebox,'' said Dick
Russell of the pilots association.
   ``I cannot and will not say it's unsafe, but I will say a pilot
flying into Lindbergh has to be on the ball at all times. There's
very little room for error,'' he said.
   Lindbergh handled 11 million people last year, but planners say
its saturation point may come in five to 10 years, the time to make
another airport operational. A new airport would have to serve
about 40 million passengers by 2050, aviation planners and civic
leaders say.
   Despite some 40 studies since 1960, no consensus has developed
on an alternative to Lindbergh.
   One proposal called for a binational airport on Otay Mesa, at
the Mexican border, but that would require the negotiation of
international agreements with Mexico.
   Other possibilities include a ``hub-and-spoke'' concept in which
a main airport would be constructed in Imperial Valley, some 100
miles to the east, with travelers shuttled to San Diego on smaller
planes or a high-speed train.
   An offshore, or ``floating'' airport also has been discussed.
   Around San Diego, options have dwindled as urban sprawl gobbled
undeveloped land.
   ``The only place that development hasn't preempted is Miramar
and that's because the Navy has preserved it,'' said county
supervisor Brian Bilbray.
   But the cost of replacing the air base, home to the ``Top Gun''
pilot school, would be $10 billion, said U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery,
R-San Diego.
   ``Miramar is not an option,'' said Lowery. ``The Navy's not just
said `no.' They've said, `Hell, no.' ''

   Adela Rogers St. Johns, one of
journalism's avowed ``sob sisters'' who was a friend of former
President Nixon and newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, died
Wednesday. She was 94.
   Mrs. St. Johns, whose reporting career spanned nearly 60 years
and included such major stories as the Lindbergh kidnapping, had
been hospitalized at the South County Convalescent Hospital.
   An ardent feminist and a pioneer in her field, Mrs. St. Johns
once wrote: ``I wish women would stand together and shackle the men
who want to move us backwards.''
   Hearst hired her as a cub reporter at the San Francisco Examiner
for $7 a week in 1913, a time when there were few women in the
newsroom.
   The following year, she transferred to the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner, another Hearst newspaper, and later worked for the
International News Service. ``She was a kind of wild, uninhibited
woman before feminism came in,'' said Mel Durslag, a Los Angeles
Herald Examiner sports columnist and 50-year Hearst veteran. ``She
was a tough, hard newspaper woman, one of the guys. She was a
figure from the old roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no
longer lives.''
   She covered the ``trial of the century'' of Bruno Richard
Hauptmann, charged in the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles
A. Lindbergh's infant son. When Britain's Edward VIII abdicated,
she was assigned the story. Later, she covered the assassination of
Louisiana political boss Huey Long and the trial of Patty Hearst,
the publisher's granddaughter.
   She was an avowed ``sob sister,'' saying at one time, ``Unless
you move the heart of the country, you will never get it moving.''
   In 1962, she published ``Final Verdict,'' about her father,
renowned criminal lawyer Earl Rogers, but perhaps her best-received
book was ``The Honeycomb,'' an autobiography published in 1969.
   In 1924, she married William Ivan ``Ike'' St. Johns, the
Herald's chief copy editor. They were divorced, and she remarried
twice, with both those marriages also ending in divorce. She had
three children from her marriages.
   Mrs. St. Johns was a longtime friend of former President Nixon,
who in 1970 honored her as the only woman among eight journalists
awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
   The award cited her for ``exceptional ability to reveal the
human story behind the news.''

   Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who long dominated civilian
politics in Panama even though deposed from the presidency three
times by the military, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Arias, who lived in exile in Miami, was educated in the United
States and became active in his new nation's politics as early as
1931, when he helped engineer a coup against the president. He
later was ambassador to France and England, and in Europe became
enamored of Mussolini's fascism.
   Arias returned to advocate it in Panama, and was elected
president in 1940-41, 1949-51 and for 11 days in 1968. Each time,
he was ousted by the Military. In 1986 Arias accused the military
of killing opposition leader Dr. Hugo Spadafora, who had accused
Noriega's government of involvement with drugs. This year in Miami,
Noriega was indicted for alleged drug trafficking.

days after he began his grueling voyage.;   The U.S. Coast Guard escorted
d'Aboville across the Columbia River bar, the area of turbulence where river
currents collide with ocean waves. As he approached the coast this morning, he

docked, hugging his wife, Cornelia, who had climbed aboard.;   D'Aboville had
been expected to arrive as early as 9 a.m., but his progress was slower than
expected in waters known for dangerous currents and tricky winds. He came in
shortly before noon.;   On Wednesday, D'Aboville spoke by radio with his wife

said he was in good health.;   D'Aboville set out from Choshi, Japan, on July
11 in a bid to become the second person to row alone across the Pacific. He

times. On Tuesday, it flipped several times in 80 mph winds and 28-foot seas
about 70 miles offshore. He suffered a cut on his forehead and injured his
back.;   Peter Bird of Britain rowed some 9,000 miles from San Francisco to
Australia in 1982-83. D'Aboville's west-to-east journey was considered more
difficult because of the ocean currents.;   The adventure was sponsored by

   Charles Lindbergh's historic words were, "I made it." 
Neil Armstrong uttered the neatly crafted "one small step" lines. 
Dick Rutan, at touchdown yesterday after his and Jeana Yeager's nine-day, nonstop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the globe, simply said, "Miller time." 

   Those words are a part of America's popular culture. 
So are individualistic feats of daring and creative enterprise. 
Being reminded of that after enduring several weeks of nonstop and often self-demeaning acrimony from the nation's capital is the nicest Christmas present we can imagine. 

   The admen who compose beer commercials usually are in closer touch with our culture than more elevated thinkers. 
Creative and constructive work well done earns a time to relax. 
When Voyager alighted on the California desert after an incredible feat of aircraft design and human endurance, we, at least, needed no further refreshment. 

   "Not bad for three people, eh?" asked Dick Rutan pointedly when a congressman thrust himself forward to welcome the fliers back. 
The congressman, whose name we didn't catch, obviously meant well but seemed out of place in that bright Mojave desert world of Burt Rutan, who had designed and built a beautiful and unique airplane, and of Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who had just flown it around the world. 

   A reporter wanted to know why the Rutans and Ms. Yeager undertook this adventure. 
The answer, which demands reflection, was that they were sure it could be done and wanted to experience "the event," the accomplishment of something never before achieved. 
Lindbergh would have understood. 
So would any artist who ever found self-expression in putting paint on canvas or musical notes on a staff. 

   Burt Rutan's artistry is airplanes. 
Someone has called him an "aerospace hacker," a term of high praise that equates him with computer hackers and all the other tinkerers whose imaginations have yielded up our modern inventions. 
Rutan planes are things of beauty -- lightweight creations using Hexcel fiber-reinforced composites and honeycomb for strength plus little "canard" wings up front for extra lift and stability. 
His speciality is putting together experimental, one-of-a-kind, small-scale prototypes to test out new designs for builders of private and military aircraft. 
The Voyager, with its incredible capacity to lift 9.5 times its own weight (which enabled it to carry enough fuel for its global flight), was the ultimate expression of his art. 
A fuel-efficient, liquid-cooled Continental engine and a new long-lasting synthetic motor oil from Mobil contributed to the 'round-the-world feat. 

   Burt Rutan has not escaped America's constraints on enterprise. 
He at one time marketed $100 and $200 instruction kits for would-be builders of home-made airplanes. 
As with so many small-business men these days, he ran into the liability crisis. 
A customer neglected a few steps, particularly the use of bolts as well as glue to hold the wings on his craft. 
He crashed and sued. 
Mr. Rutan won his case, but spent $10,000 in legal fees, an experience that persuaded him to move into non-retail endeavors. 

   There is irony in the fact that someone thought it necessary to put a counter on the Voyager landing gear to be checked by a National Aeronautic Association official after the landing, so there could never be any suspicion that Dick and Jeana stopped somewhere for refueling during their flight. 
The NAA, a private group that certifies aircraft competitions and record-setting flights, was only doing its job, but we never entirely escape the lawyer culture. 

   We escaped it sufficiently, however. 
Dick Rutan in his cowboy hat and Jeana Yeager in her flight suit, perched on top of Voyager to stretch their legs after 25,012 bumpy and at times harrowing miles, were symbols of that escape yesterday. 
Their safe return brings us a full measure of Christmas joy.

   Douglas ``Wrong Way''
Corrigan, going the right way this time, returned Monday to the
airfield where he landed his small plane 50 years ago after leaving
New York on a flight to California.
   ``Look, no hands!'' the 81-year-old American declared, arms
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the commuter plane carrying him
from Dublin landed at Baldonnel Airport. Corrigan wore the same
leather flying jacket he had on when he landed here the first time.
   An army band, a Cabinet minister and the U.S. ambassador greeted
him, along with R.W. Sullivan, the aircraft engineer who met him on
the first trip.
   He came to Ireland by commercial jet for festivities celebrating
his famous wrong-way flight, then joined the pilot in the cockpit
of a propeller plane renamed WW2 _ or Wrong Way 2 _ for the
10-minute flight to Baldonnel.
   Corrigan has always said he misread his compass, headed east by
mistake, and did not know until his $900 Curtiss-Robin monoplane
pierced the clouds 28 hours later that he was over Ireland. He had
applied to fly the Atlantic, but was refused because the plane,
carrying 330 gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was
deemed too heavy to be safe over the ocean.
   Before leaving the United States for his first trip to Ireland
since, the Texas-born pilot hinted his story might change, but he
stuck to it at the initial ceremony.
   ``I followed the wrong end of the compass needle,'' he told
admirers at Baldonnel Airport. ``It's a simple thing to happen. It
shouldn't have happened. I was the first one to admit that I had
made a mistake and I was willing to correct it.''
   He recalled that the the runway at Baldonnel, now Irish air
force headquarters, was a grass strip the last time he landed there.
   ``I taxied up to a little shack where there were two men in
uniform,'' Corrigan said. ``I was in trouble until they found out
what my name was and the policeman said, `He's just another
Irishman coming home.'''
   U.S. Ambassador Margaret Heckler said Monday: ``I'm so proud of
you. You are amazing.''
   Corrigan said he had never really been in Ireland before because
he had no passport or other papers the first time he arrived.
``This time I'm in Ireland and I have the papers to prove it,'' he
said.
   Also present were Transport Minister John Wilson; Alice Glenn,
deputy lord mayor of Dublin, and David Kennedy, chief executive of
the national airline Aer Lingus, who wished ``a hearty cead mile
failte _ 100,000 welcomes _ to Mr. Douglas `Wrong Way' Corrigan.''
   Wilson congratulated the sprightly American on still being able
to fit into his 1938 flying jacket and said he hoped Corrigan's
plane, now partly dismantled at his home in Santa Ana, Calif.,
might one day return to Ireland for exhibit.
   When Corrigan landed in Ireland on July 18, 1938, after a flight
that was supposed to take him to Long Beach, Calif., he had only $3
in his pocket and knew no one, he said in an interview Sunday
before departing from New York.
   This time, accompanied by his son, Harry, and daughter-in-law,
Charlotte, Corrigan crossed the Atlantic in six hours as an honored
guest of Aer Lingus in a Boeing 747. The airline plans three days
of ceremonies for him.
   U.S. aviation authorities suspended Corrigan from flying for
five days after he his unauthorized trip to Dublin, but Americans
and the Irish loved his explanation.
   The results in the United States were a New York ticker-tape
parade, a meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a movie,
``The Flying Irishman,'' starring Corrigan as himself.
   He was a woodworker and took up aviation when he helped build
the Spirit of St. Louis, in which Charles Lindbergh made the first
solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927.
   Corrigan bought his own plane for $310 in 1931 and spent $590
modifying it for the trip.

   Douglas ``Wrong Way'' Corrigan returned
here today for ceremonies commemorating his famous wrong turn 50
years ago that led him to fly thousands of miles east instead of
west, to Ireland instead of California.
   ``Look, no hands,'' the 81-year-old American declared, hands
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the Aer Lingus plane carrying him
from Dublin landed at Baldonnel Airport after a 10-minute flight.
   First to greet him at Baldonnel, now Irish air force
headquarters, was R.W. O'Sullivan, the aviation engineer who met
him the first time he landed in Dublin, in 1938.
   U.S. Ambassador Margaret Heckler told the aviator: ``I'm so
proud of you. You are amazing.''
   Corrigan's first transatlantic hop as pilot of a $900 monoplane
was forbidden by U.S. officials, who said his plane wasn't safe. He
said he would fly back to Long Beach, Calif., but somehow he landed
in Ireland anyhow.
   This time, Corrigan arrived in Ireland by commercial jet for
festivities celebrating his famed wrong-way flight, then boarded
the Shorts-360 propellor plane, renamed WW2 (for ``wrong way'') in
his honor, and flew to Baldonnel in the cockpit.
   He sported the same leather flying jacket he wore on his first
flight.
   Corrigan flew from New York as an honored passenger of Aer
Lingus, the Irish Airline, on a Boeing 747. He wouldn't say in an
interview before his dekparture from Kennedy International Airport
Sunday night if the true story of what happened 50 years ago might
come out during his visit to Ireland.
   But Corrigan, of Santa Ana, Calf., hinted recently that his
``wrong-way'' explanation may change after he arrives in Dublin.
Nevertheless, he stuck to his story during the initial ceremony
today.
   Before his departure, Corrigan was whisked in a New York Police
Department helicopter to the Brooklyn airfield for a nostalgic
visit.
   ``It looks a little different than it did 50 years ago. It's got
more buildings scattered around,'' he said. ``But the runway is
still there and the control tower.''
   His Aer Lingus flight was delayed for several hours because of
rain in New York. When he took off from Floyd Bennett Field in
Brooklyn on July 17, 1938, ``it wasn't raining at all,'' the
81-year-old Corrigan recalled. It took him 28 hours to get to
Dublin.
   ``When I saw the water I didn't think it was the Pacific, but at
that time I was in the air for 26 hours and when I came down
through the clouds I noticed I had been reading the compass needle
backwards,'' he told Irish state radio.
   ``That was when I first realized I had been going east instead
of west,'' he said.
   Today's flight took about six hours, and Corrigan did not seem
to be suffering from the effects of jet lag when he arrived in
Ireland this morning.
   ``I believe he's in splendid form. We had plans he'd rest for a
while but he really wasn't interested in that,'' said Margaret
Coyne, an Aer Lingus spokeswoman in Dublin. Corrigan is staying in
Dublin as a guest of Aer Lingus, which plans three days of
ceremonies.
   On July 18, 1938, when he first touched down in Ireland, he only
had $3 in his pocket and didn't know anyone, Corrigan said.
   On his arrival in Dublin a half century ago, Corrigan claimed,
``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way.''
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of Long Beach, Calif., after federal aviation authorities
said his used Curtiss-Robin monoplane was too heavy for a safe
flight to Ireland.
   The Bureau of Air Commerce, forerunner of the Federal Aviation
Administration, suspended Corrigan from flying for five days after
he made his unauthorized flight.
   But America and Ireland loved his explanation. After he returned
to New York, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was a meeting
with President Franklin Roosevelt, and a movie, ``The Flying
Irishman,'' starring Corrigan as himself.
   Corrigan, a woodworker, was inspired to try aviation when he
helped build the ``Spirit of St. Louis,'' which Charles Lindbergh
flew across the ocean in 1927. He bought his plane for $310 in 1931
and spent $590 modifying it.
   Also present at the ceremony welcoming Corrigan to Ireland were
Transport Minister John Wilson, Dublin's deputy lord mayor Alice
Glenn, and Aer Lingus chief executive David Kennedy, who wished ``a
hearty cead mile failte -- 100,000 welcomes _ to Mr. Douglas `Wrong
Way' Corrigan.''

LINDBERGH NEEDS A SHORT-TERM FIX; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SEARCH FOR NEW SITE SHOULD BE PRESSED BEFORE SPENDING $289 MILLION OR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to argue with much of what Lindbergh Field's many critics have to 
say. The downtown airport is in the wrong place for a growing metropolis, 
making for some white-knuckle flying past city skyscrapers. The single runway 
is uncomfortably short, maybe dangerously so. The noise created by takeoffs 
over Point Loma and Loma Portal is horrendous. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Lindbergh has to be moved. We all know it. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if city leaders picked a site tomorrow, there would be no new airport 
for at least a decade, probably more. That's why Lindbergh must be expanded to 
handle passenger traffic that is expected to steadily increase over the next 
decade. The continued growth of San Diego's economy also demands it. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the question of how much expansion is necessary. For now, the 
$27-million emergency plan already adopted by the Port District appears 
adequate. We see no reason for the port to leap ahead with either of two very 
expensive expansion plans that would take Lindbergh into the early part of next 
century, and in the process take the urgency out of the new effort to create a 
binational airport on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The interim plan now being implemented would take care of Lindbergh's most 
critical needs. It would move the leaking fuel tanks that supply Lindbergh's 
jets, increasing fuel storage capacity limited by Lindbergh's cramped 
configuration. That would take trucks that must constantly replenish 
Lindbergh's one-day fuel supply off Harbor Drive. It would add eight passenger 
gates and baggage claim areas. It would build a better access route to Harbor 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Those improvements would allow Lindbergh to accommodate about 16.5 million 
passengers, the number expected to use the airport by 1996 or 1997. The two 
major expansion options -- one costing $289 million, the other priced at $385 
million -- are designed to stretch airport capacity to about 24 million, the 
number of passengers expected by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be time to consider those options in the future. The port 
should set itself a reasonable short-term deadline for determining if the 
latest effort is going to take off. If it doesn't -- and recent history does 
not indicate much hope of success -- the Port can take up the expansion plans 
discussed at this week's public hearing. That hearing was held only because the 
City Council asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
If the port is in the mood to spend money, it might want to consider purchasing 
the ill-conceived Laurel Travel Center at the foot of the runway and taking it 
down a level or two. That would ameliorate the fears of pilots who have called 
it an accident waiting to happen -- regardless of the FAA's opinion that the 
building is not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to derail the effort to relocate Lindbergh to a better 
spot by making plans to expand the current site to accommodate 24 million 
people.

REMEMBERING 'THE GREATEST FIGHTER PLANE IN THE WORLD'; 
</P>
<P>
AIRCRAFT: JEAN-LUC BEGHIN FIRST SAW THE P-51 MUSTANG IN THE SKIES OVER EUROPE 
DURING WORLD WAR II. THUS BEGAN A LOVE AFFAIR THAT HAS LASTED 46 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though 46 years have passed, the moment remains vivid to Jean-Luc Beghin. He 
can still see the planes chasing each other in the skies over war-torn 
Brussels. The German plane, he remembers, was dark and menacing. The other, an 
American fighter, its engine thundering, was brightly decorated with huge white 
stars on its wings and fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dogfight," Beghin says of that spring day in 1944. "I was in 
kindergarten and all the kids wanted to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Beghin does not remember much about the German plane. "I was only 5 years old 
at the time," he explains. But he recalls every detail about the American 
fighter and especially the words of one teacher who joined her students staring 
up at the sky. "I remember her saying, 'That's a Mustang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The P-51 Mustang. Just the name brings a smile to Beghin. For it was, he says, 
more than a fighter plane. It was a symbol. Proud. Flashy. Powerful. "It was my 
image of America," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Beghin lives in Westchester, only a mile or so from the former North 
American Aviation plant where the P-51 was born and built. And Beghin is among 
those celebrating the 50th anniversary today of the fighter's first test flight 
over Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old artist is completing a pen-and-ink rendition of the aircraft's 
cockpit for the French aviation magazine, Info Pilote. The publication's 
six-page tribute to the P-51 will be among many celebrations worldwide, 
including air shows and exhibits this weekend from Santa Maria, Calif., to 
Duxforth, England. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the anniversary tributes will be any more personal than Beghin's. 
For the P-51 Mustang inspired Beghin as a boy and launched a love affair with 
aviation that continues today, particularly in his pen-and-ink drawings of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my main purpose in life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
From his days as an aviation illustrator for the Belgian Air Force to his 
employment today as a flight coordinator for Air France, Beghin's life has 
revolved around aviation. 
</P>
<P>
His works, displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and NASA's Houston Museum, 
depict aircraft subjects ranging from Charles Lindbergh's "Spirit of St. Louis" 
to the Apollo cockpit. In all, about 20 renderings by Beghin have been 
commissioned for aviation exhibits and publications. 
</P>
<P>
Now, those works will be joined by Beghin's drawings of the P-51, an aircraft 
originally commissioned by the Royal Air Force only months before the United 
States joined World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1940, the British were short of fighter planes and came to North American 
Aviation, which had built the AT-6 trainer for England," says Beghin, who has 
followed the P-51's history since his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Given four months to design and build a new fighter for England, the aircraft 
company (later absorbed by Rockwell International) unveiled the P-51 Mustang, a 
sleek, soaring aircraft faster than any fighter before it. Soon, the aircraft 
established itself as the finest American-built fighter used by the Royal Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the United States began purchasing the fighters, the RAF had 
replaced the Mustangs' unreliable first engines with 1,600-horsepower engines 
built by Rolls-Royce. Later, the same engines, built in the United States by 
Packard, were installed in the P-51s commissioned by the U.S. Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The new engines allowed the P-51 a top speed of 487 miles an hour. And the 
addition of auxiliary fuel tanks extended its flying range enough for the 
aircraft to escort American bombers all the way from England to Berlin. Those 
bombers included the B-17, whose exploits have been popularized in the current 
movie, "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
"It became the greatest fighter plane in the world," says Beghin. 
</P>
<P>
After Germany unveiled the world's first jet fighter, it was a P-51, flown by 
the soon-to-be-famous test pilot Chuck Yeager, that downed a Messerschmidt 262. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, when Beghin was a boy, it was a P-51 that he remembers helping 
to liberate his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he says, his fascination with the aircraft has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he spoke with the P-51's designer, Edgar Schmued, who lived in Rancho 
Palos Verdes and died in 1985. And two months ago, Beghin took his first flight 
in a P-51 during a trip to Paris. "When we took off, I had some tears in my 
eyes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, Beghin adds, he will finally finish a book on the P-51 Mustang. "I've 
been working on it for some time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will continue his drawings. And, he says, there are plenty 
of memories of the P-51 that will forever connect him to his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time, just after the war, when Beghin bought package after package of 
Belgium chocolate bars, just to collect an aviation history card of the P-51 
Mustang. "Some of my friends had the card and I kept buying the chocolate just 
to get one. I don't remember how many bars I finally ate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Or the moment, after Belgium's liberation in September, 1944, when Beghin got 
his first close look at one of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a Mustang on display in the public square. I remember going up and 
touching the bare metal and seeing the plane up close. The bright colors and 
that white star. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," he says, "like Disneyland before its time." 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  THE WHEELS of a Cessna 185 touched down on the tarmac of the Redding Airport
recently, ending the 41-year saga of veteran Department of Fish and Game pilot
Pat Symons.;   Symons, 67, was hired as a warden-pilot in 1950. Since then he
has logged more than 22,000 hours and 2.5 million miles flying every
imaginable type of mission for the DFG, including law enforcement, aerial fish
planting and wildlife surveys.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Outdoors  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To Symons, who with his wife, Joan, makes his home in Cottonwood, the last
day on the job was like any other.;   "I had two projects. One was a survey
flight over the Tehama Wildlife Area, most of which is closed to access this
time year, to make sure no one was locked up inside the area.;   "Then an
anadromous fisheries biologist climbed aboard and we cruised the Sacramento
River from Princeton to Keswick Dam looking for new salmon redds.";   Looking
back, Symons says that "Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic in 1927
fired the aviation mindedness of a lot of young people, including me.";   He
steered his education toward aeronautical engineering until World War II came
along. He joined the Air Corps and became a pilot, flying twin-engine C46
cargo planes over the "hump" -- the Himalayas -- in the Chinese-Burma-India
Theater.;   Following the war, Symons returned to school and earned a degree
in aircraft and engine maintenance and in 1950 went to work for the DFG.;  
"We used to do anything we could possibly think of," says Symons. "We flew air
patrols hunting for violators in all kinds of situations, but the most
dramatic and glamorous thing we did was high altitude fish planting.";  
Symons was one of the first pilots to do aerial fish plants in California.
"For all the glamour of aerial fish planting," says Symons, "it was a mass
production money-maker in the sense that it was the cheapest way to get fish
into the high mountain lakes.;   "There are a jillion tight lakes, some
because they are tiny, some because they're way, way down in a hole and you
have to point the plane straight down to get to them. Once in a while we'd
have a judgment screw-up and miss the lake, but that didn't happen very
often.";   Before moving to the Redding area in 1974, Symons spent 22 years in
Southern California, where he also flew ocean patrols and biological surveys
spotting sardines, mackerel, gray whales, harbor seals and sea otters. Flying
sea otter surveys was the hardest and most boring, according to Symons.;  
"There's nothing to see but a lot of glaring water and occasionally a little
pod of sea otters. But you have to pay attention because you have to keep
track of your flight lines.";   Some of his most rewarding work was flying law
enforcement flights in the 1950s. "I remember flying the Cleveland National
Forest out of San Diego," says Symons, "when I found what looked like a couple
of hunters in a closed area. I circled for a while waiting for a ground warden
to come in.;   "Apparently my circling flushed out several other people. The
ground wardens wrote 32 citations that weekend. When word got to the regional
office in Los Angeles I got a call from the inspector inquiring about the type
of sandbagging we were doing to come up with this good of a count.";   "More
recently I was working with Don Gastineau, the warden out of Crescent City.
The California crab season was closed and Don was concerned that a number of
Oregon boats would come into our closed waters. Because the weather was very
foggy, they did. Don and I, flying in the fog, were able to spot and identify
a number of boats, making a number of commercial cases.";   "The prettiest
flying was the spring flights to check the high mountain lakes," says Symons.
"We'd make two or three flights a week, checking on the break-up of the ice.  </TEXT>

NO QUICK STUDY ON SITE FOR AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: THE PANEL SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE FOR LINDBERGH FIELD WANTS MORE TIME 
AND MONEY TO DO THE JOB. ONE COUNCILMAN CALLS IT A WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
The panel studying the relocation of Lindbergh Field agreed Thursday to extend 
its review another year and spend $350,000 to $400,000 more to examine the 
"multiple airport option" unveiled last month by San Diego City Councilmen Ron 
Roberts and Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
If approved today by the San Diego Assn. of Governments' Board of Directors, 
the Airport Policy Advisory Committee's recommendation would about double the 
cost and duration of the search for an alternative to increasingly crowded 
Lindbergh Field, a study financed by a $350,000 Federal Aviation Administration 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
But Filner, who with Roberts led the call for a look at the two-airport plan, 
said the effort will be worthless because of restrictions on the scope of the 
study imposed by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete waste of money," Filner said after the panel's meeting. "It's 
just a complete waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
Filner claimed that, as now written, the new study will automatically reject 
the multiple-airport option and point toward the three alternatives already 
identified by the Sandag airport committee: Miramar Naval Air Station, a tract 
east of Miramar and a huge parcel on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the new examination will require that at least one of the 
region's airports accommodate 20 million passengers annually, a 12,000-foot 
runway, 5,000-foot safety zones at either end of the runway, simultaneous 
landings on widely separated landing strips, and full instrument-landing 
capacity. Under consideration would be Lindbergh, Brown and Montgomery fields 
in San Diego, Gillespie Field in El Cajon and McClellan-Palomar Airport in 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Filner and Roberts' multiple airport option is based on the assumption that no 
site in the county could accommodate the estimated 35 million airline 
passengers expected to fly here by the middle of next century. It seeks to 
determine whether the load could be parceled out to Lindbergh and an expanded 
Brown Field, along with Montgomery and McClellan-Palomar airports. The Sandag 
panel added Gillespie to the list. 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen believe that Miramar could handle the traffic, but believe it is 
politically unlikely that the Navy would allow a civilian or joint-use airport 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts aide Wayne Raffesberger said the safety zone and runway length 
requirements would rule out Lindbergh, and the safety zone and 
instrument-landing requirements would appear to eliminate the expanded Brown 
Field plan unveiled by the councilmen last month with the help of a coalition 
of South Bay landowners. But he was hesitant to condemn the study entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"Those criteria, if strictly applied would appear to eliminate all five of 
those airports, I think," Raffesberger said. But, he added, "I don't know what 
to make of it yet. We hadn't seen those criteria." Roberts is attending an 
Urban Land Institute meeting out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hedy St. John, chairwoman of the study panel's technical committee, said she 
"would respectfully disagree" with Filner's assessment, arguing that, even at 
Lindbergh, land could be purchased to accommodate 5,000-foot safety zones at 
either end of the airport's 9,400-foot single runway. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she argued, safety criteria should not be compromised at the 
beginning of the study. "To compromise the standards and give the people of 
this region inadequate air and ground safety is not acceptable as a starting 
point," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn., which favors the joint use of Miramar as the safest 
alternative, endorsed the safety criteria at a meeting of the technical 
committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay politicians, including U.S. Rep. Jim Bates, D-San Diego, State Sen. 
Wadie Deddeh, D-Chula Vista, and Filner, will ask Sandag in a letter to be 
delivered today to consider the joint use of Miramar, Filner said. An ALPA 
official also has signed that letter, he said.

   Gang violence and drug peddling at a
housing project behind a junior high school show no signs of going
away, so officials are trying to make the campus bulletproof by
building a 10-foot high wall.
   Faculty and administrators wore T-shirts Friday bearing ``The
Great Wall of Lindbergh'' logo to show their enthusiasm for the
$160,000 project at Lindbergh Junior High School. It is scheduled
for completion in six weeks.
   Judy Wade, a physical education teacher, has said she's seen
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during
her 25 years at the school. ``Now, it's not what they're throwing,
but what they're shooting,'' she said.
   Students were evacuated from the recreation fields twice during
one week in April because of gunfire. Two years ago, a student
playing basketball after school was hit in the chest by a bullet
that whizzed through a chain-link fence.
   ``They've had trouble there for as long as I can remember,''
said Principal Max Fraley, referring to the problem housing project
that is adjacent to the schoolyard. ``It is a very large area where
a lot of drug dealers congregate.''
   The concrete block wall will extend 300 yards along the school's
playground, separating the school and 1,200 students from the
713-unit Carmelitos Housing Project, Fraley said.
   Funds for the wall came from the city school district and Los
Angeles County after teacher Joan Reedy was nearly hit recently by
bullets as she walked with students to a softball diamond.
   ``Shots came through the fence and we heard the whizzing by,''
Ms. Reedy said. ``I was OK at first, but when I got home I was
scared. So I went to the Board of Education and said, `Something
needs to be done.'''
   Plans call for the wall to be bordered by shrubs and decorated
with a large mural, Fraley said.
   ``We'll use anti-graffiti paint, something that it will be easy
to wash the gang graffiti off of,'' he said.
   The mural will include a painting of the Spirit of St. Louis,
the airplane aviator Charles Linbergh flew in 1927 in the first
solo trans-Atlantic flight, and a large ``L'' overlapped by a
picture of an eagle, the school mascot.
   The slogan ``Lindbergh Leads the Way'' will top the mural
painted in school colors of blue and red.
   ``A 900-foot wall of this sort is significant because it
recognizes the problems we face today, and it will make everyone on
school grounds feel a lot safer,'' Fraley said.
   The principal said the student who was hit two years ago while
playing basketball is now in high school and still has the bullet
in him.
   ``The doctors said it would do more harm to take it out, and I'm
told he hasn't suffered any ill effects from it after he recovered
from the gunshot itself,'' Fraley said.
   ``The wall is terrific,'' said student Joe Trejo, 13, who lives
in the Carmelitos project next door. ``Why? Because I don't want to
get shot.''

<LEADPARA>  Douglas Corrigan, a mechanic and barnstorming pilot, wanted to fly his
single-engine plane to Ireland from New York, but the powers that be refused
to allow it, saying the flight was too dangerous. So he filed a flight plan
for L.A. and flew to Ireland anyway, arriving on this date in 1938, and
quickly was given the nickname of "Wrong Way" Corrigan. His explanation for
his error was that he somehow had been reading the wrong end of the magnetic
needle on his compass. Corrigan's only other claim to fame is that he was the
man who in 1927 pulled the chocks away from the Spirit of St. Louis for
Charles Lindbergh's historic flight.  </LEADPARA>

<LEADPARA>  It's a long way from banging out Led Zeppelin guitar riffs to producing blimps
that really fly.;    But two former Memphis musicians have built a half-dozen
flying machines since leaving rock 'n' roll a decade ago. And the U.S. Army
may soon be flying their latest egg-shaped, helium-filled creation.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HOW 2 ENTREPRENEURS BUILT A BETTER BLIMP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Originally designed as a single-seat sport flying vehicle, the four-finned,
60-foot-long blimp known, unromantically, as the Z-200, also happened to meet
Army specifications for a remote-controlled observation and communications
platform.;    Last summer, a research and development team from Westinghouse
Electric Corp.'s defense contracting division was dispatched to Memphis to
meet Memphis Airships owners Steve Garner and Jim Groce.;    The two sides
struck a deal, and now a vanilla white blimp bearing Army and Westinghouse
insignia awaits flight testing at the Memphis Airships' Presidents Island
hangar.;    "It looks so great that sometimes it's hard to contain the urge to
just hop in it and fly," said Garner, 39, a former engineering student at the
University of Florida and the University of Tennessee. "But our company's
future is riding on this thing -- and besides, it belongs to them -- not us.";
   Westinghouse, a giant Pittsburgh-based electronics firm, paid about $50,000
for the blimp. Company officials have not decided whether it will be flown
first by a pilot or through a ground-based remote control system. Flight tests
are scheduled for early 1991, and Garner and Groce want to get started.;   
"We've fulfilled our construction contract, and we are now waiting for the
operational contract," Garner said. "Our program doesn't seem to have been
affected by federal budget cuts, and we look forward to showing people how
well it can perform.";    The 9,500-cubic foot blimp has roughly one-tenth the
volume of a typical hot-air balloon. It is designed to have a 43 mph top
speed, a 32 mph cruise speed and a maximum ceiling of 6,500 feet. It will be
able to carry up to 275 pounds -- enough to hoist radar equipment for
monitoring borders, video cameras for surveillance or high-tech communications
systems.;    Garner and Groce say they don't know how the blimps will be used
-- and the Army isn't saying.;    But armies and dirigibles have a long and
not-so-illustrious history. The first air raid was carried out by German
dirigibles over England during World War I, when crew members tossed bombs out
by hand.;    The massive, hydrogen-filled dirigibles turned out to be as
explosive as their payloads, however, and made easy targets for British
airplanes and anti-aircraft guns.;    Before being pressed into military
service, dirigibles carried air mail in Germany as early as 1912. An English
dirigible was the first airborne vehicle to cross the Atlantic in 1919 --
eight years before Charles Lindbergh's famous solo flight.;    The golden age
of airships came to a famous and fiery finish in 1937 when the hydrogen-filled
Hindenburg exploded while trying to dock in Lakehurst, N.J., killing 37 of the
95 people aboard.;    The diminutive airships Garner and Groce make would be
dwarfed by the leviathans of yesteryear -- but the two say their products
could spur a blimp revival.;    "Companies could buy them for advertising
purposes -- like miniature versions of the Goodyear blimp," Garner said.;   
"Police could use them to watch traffic, scientists could use them to monitor
whale migrations along the California coast, and individuals could use them
for fun flying. There's no end to the potential uses.";    Civilian versions
will sell for about $50,000 each and are designed to fit Federal Aviation
Administration guidelines for ultra-light aircraft. That means pilots won't
need licenses to fly them.;    Garner and Groce say blimp buyers will be
required to pass an airship flying program on the grassy fields outside their
facility before they'll get the keys, however.;    The two claim their blimps
will be able to perform many of the same tasks as helicopters, but cheaper. A
Z-200's 24-horse-power engine burns about 2 1/2 gallons of fuel per hour
compared with about 25 gallons per hour for helicopters. A blimp can stay
airborne for about nine hours compared with about three for the helos.;    But
blimps are not without operational costs: It takes $1,000 in helium to fill a
Z-200, and the blimps need to be topped off every three or four months.;   
Garner and Groce say blimps are their passion, but their company's seven
full-time and three part-time employees earn most of their money making
inflatable advertisements: giant beer cans, tanning lotion, bottles, tires,
etc.;    The profitable advertising side of the business has supported blimp
endeavors in the past, but the two are counting on their new gas bag to change
all that.  </TEXT>

Jimsair Aviation Services, a San Diego aircraft fueling and service company 
with operations at San Diego's Lindbergh Field and in Palm Springs, has filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
President Phil Bracamonte said the company's high debt -- taken on to finance 
expansion -- coupled with a downturn in business forced it to seek protection 
from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no disruption of services and no layoffs of the company's 65 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Bracamonte said the company has $8.9 million in assets and 
$8.4 million in liabilities. Among the assets is a lease for hangar space 
through the year 2014 with the San Diego Unified Port District, operator of 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently spent a considerable sum doubling its hangar space at 
Lindbergh, but Bracamonte said problems with the Palm Springs facility were 
more to blame for the financial difficulties that led to the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
The company's major creditors include Textron, First National Bank of San Diego 
and BP Oil, the firm's attorney Peter L. Duncan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jimsair filed its bankruptcy petition in the court of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge 
James W. Meyers. The company was founded in 1952, when it established a 
presence at Lindbergh, Bracamonte said. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of the company to Flightcraft of Portland, Ore. was announced last year 
but fell through. CHRIS KRAUL

DIRE RESULTS PREDICTED WITHOUT A NEW AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY FORESEES AIRLINE CONGESTION, LOSS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AS CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego will have one of the nation's most congested airports and lose 
billions of dollars in forfeited economic growth if no new airport is built by 
2010, a new study warns. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the overburdened Lindbergh Field with a larger airport would add $33 
billion to $53 billion to the region's economy over the next seven decades, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the San Diego Assn. of Governments (Sandag) and 
written by KPMB Peat Marwick of San Francisco, was made public Monday. By 
comparing the long-term economic impact of a new airport to that of Lindbergh 
Field, the study provides fresh ammunition for those arguing that San Diego 
must build a new field. 
</P>
<P>
The study echoes "what we and others have been saying for a long time," said 
San Diego Councilman Ron Roberts, a major proponent of a new airport. "What 
surprises me is the magnitude of the problem -- both the potential losses and 
the congestion at Lindbergh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stand Taken 
</P>
<P>
But, although the report estimated the economic impact of both options, it did 
not endorse either of them, cautioned Sandag special projects director Jack 
Koerper, who heads the group's airport relocation study. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to use this information, then that's their right," Koerper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The report is full of information that might spur debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turnover Expected to Double 
</P>
<P>
It predicts that Lindbergh Field's current passenger turnover of 10 million 
annually will double by the year 2011. Even before that happens, passengers can 
expect average flight delays of five to 10 minutes, and 25 minutes to one hour 
and 40 minutes during peak hours, congestion comparable to that of Chicago's 
O'Hare airport, the authors noted. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, airlines would begin to divert flights from San Diego and stop 
expanding their local operations, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Failure to replace Lindbergh Field with a new airport would cost the region 
48,000 airport jobs by 2060, the authors predicted. That year, Lindbergh Field 
could accommodate 25 million passengers, while 40 million could pass through a 
new airport if one was built, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The industry that has more at stake than most is tourism, said Sandag economist 
Marney Cox. Of the $1.22 billion Lindbergh Field contributed to the local 
economy in 1988, $700 million was money spent here by visiting air travelers, 
the report said. Tourist spending would account for much of the money generated 
by a new airport (and lost if it is not built), Cox said. But he said the 
report did not address how many visitors would come to the city by other means 
of transport when faced with an overcrowded Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The latest report is part of a continuing Sandag study of San Diego's airport 
system, including plans for a new airport. Next month, planners will take one 
last look at Lindbergh Field to see if it could be expanded to satisfy the 
region's future needs, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed alternatives include two sites in and next to the Miramar Naval Air 
Station and one on the U. S.-Mexican border on Otay Mesa.
