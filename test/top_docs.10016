CREATING FUN GAMES CAN BE SERIOUS WORK; 


RETAIL: THOSE IN THE COMPETITIVE CONTEST OF SELLING ADULT PLAY THINGS ARE 
RELYING ON BUDGET-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS SUCCESSFUL. 




By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Creating a game that is fun to play is serious business for Brian Hersch. 


"There is an underlying presumption that since game playing is frivolous, then 
game making is frivolous," said Hersch, the creator of such adult board games 
as "Outburst" and "Taboo." 


"I don't think it's frivolous at all. I damn well better (take it seriously) or 
I won't be successful. It's my business." 


This no-nonsense approach has made Hersch one of the rare winners in the 
competitive contest to create a hot-selling adult board game. Six years after 
Trivial Pursuit mania swept the nation and unleashed a flood of adult board 
games, the category is now stagnant, leaving board game makers hard at work to 
come up with the next hit that will end up on thousands of holiday gift lists 
year after year. Many industry players also see the current economic slump as a 
way of boosting sales. 


"There hasn't been anything hot and sexy for adults since Pictionary," said 
Larry Carlat, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, a New York-based trade magazine, 
referring to the 5 1/2-year-old game based on charades. 


"I'm not sure the category is going great guns," said Carlat. "The stuff with 
board games is that there is only one really hot and sexy one that drives the 
business." 


Most entries in the adult board game category have not even come close to 
reaching the 100,000 sales mark, which qualifies them as successes and help 
ensure a spot on crowded store shelves. Even those who have created a hit game 
have trouble matching their success with a new and different item. 


"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said game maker Robert Angel, who has not 
come up with a successful new game since creating Pictionary, which has sold 20 
million sets in various versions -- including Bible Pictionary. "We know we 
have gotten lucky." 


The adult board game category had long been a backwater of the toy industry, 
and was dominated by strategy games such as Othello and Risk. But 
question-and-answer games such as Trivial Pursuit -- which has sold more than 
40 million sets in its different versions -- were less intimidating and 
appealed to a broader group, with a minimum amount of strategy and a heavy 
reliance on common knowledge and popular culture. Shipments of adult board 
games totaled $158 million in 1989, according to the Toy Manufacturers of 
America. 


With strategic games, "you are into the game itself, into winning," said Chris 
Hixson, a veteran game player who was browsing through the Glendale outlet of 
the Game Keeper, which stocks more than 30 adult board games. "But with Trivial 
Pursuit and Pictionary, you are into having fun with people and enjoying 
yourself." 


"The game becomes the vehicle for (social) interaction -- it's no longer the 
focal point," said Phil Orbanes, a toy and game industry consultant and former 
chief of research and development at Parker Bros. "These new games do not put 
too much of an emphasis on the feat of winning. It's more on the experience" of 
playing. 


Trivial Pursuit "was a very important step forward for the board game," said 
David Leibowitz, a toy industry analyst at American Securities in New York. 
But, "if we eliminate Trivial Pursuit from the discussion, you will discover 
that there has not been an overwhelming increase" in adult board game sales. 


The games also exploit the common experiences and knowledge of the nation's 
baby boom generation, which grew up with a plethora of toys. "They were the 
most coddled generation in history when it came to. . .play things," said 
Orbanes. 


Brian Hersch, the Century City-based real estate developer turned board game 
maker, says that television game shows have also played a role in addicting 
baby boomers such as himself to board games. 


"Playing games was just part of life," said Hersch, who grew up playing Risk 
and Clue and watching "To Tell The Truth" on television. 


Hersch's biggest hit -- Outburst, a free-association word game that has sold 3 
million copies -- weaves in all the traits that have made for successful board 
games. In Outburst, competing players, for example, are given a minute to come 
up with as many responses to such statements as "Commands You Give a Dog" 
listed on playing cards. 


"It takes in everybody's common knowledge," said Hersch. "This is not an 
intellectual experience, playing a game. We know this isn't brain surgery." 


In fact, games linked to technical or obscure subjects -- such as high finance 
in Trump the Game -- turn most players off. These games "were too heavily 
involved with what appeared to be high-level finance," said Orbanes. "That's 
too intimidating to most people." 


Rules are a crucial concern to board game designers since adult players of 
today have little patience. "I have to have you understand the game in three 
minutes," said Hersch. "I can kill the game if the rules are too complicated. 
It's critically important to keep a steady pace, an enlivened pace. If you have 
to keep going back to the rules, people say 'who needs this?' " 


Game boards and score-keeping devices, which are not essential to playing many 
of the games, help define the limits of the game and lend it a competitive 
zeal. "You don't have to have a board to play," said Hersch. "But a lot of 
people won't play unless its competitive." 


With skimpy advertising budgets, board game makers rely heavily on word of 
mouth to boost sales. "If you get the game to play well, then they you have the 
start of word-of-mouth," said Bob Reiss, a New Jersey-based businessman who 
created a trivia game based on TV Guide magazine and is now working on a 
project with a love-and-marriage theme. "If it doesn't play well, they don't 
come back. You get one chance." 


Despite a weakening economy, adult board games might appeal to a growing number 
of budget-conscious consumers, despite price tags of $30 and up. "Some people 
will have to give up their vacation or going to the theater," said Reiss. 
"People who are watching their money will want to play games" instead. 


Many game players would agree. Davern Kroncke, a Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit 
fan from Santa Rosa, Calif., says she invites friends to dinner at her house 
and then plays games after her children go to bed. 


"It's a time for us to get together, to laugh, unwind and have a lot of fun," 
said Kroncke, a 39-year-old dental hygienist. And "it's economical," she said.

THERE'S NO MONOPOLY ON GOOD GAME IDEAS, BUT JUST TRY SELLING ONE 




By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Ask experts on the toy and game market what the chances are of successfully 
introducing a new board game -- let alone a phenomenal best-seller such as 
Trivial Pursuit -- and they will say you have a better chance of winning the 
California Lottery. 


The $500-million board game market has always been saturated and difficult to 
crack, industry observers say, but it is even tougher to break into these days, 
with Trivial Pursuit clones crowding the adult market and glitzy video games 
luring children's attention away from board games. 


Larry Carlat, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine, a leading trade 
publication in New York, said: "The average guy who thinks he's come up with a 
great game idea usually heads straight for a Milton Bradley or a Parker 
Brothers, expecting that they'll take his idea and make him a millionaire. 


"But in reality, you'll be lucky if they don't slam the door in your face." 




'Practically Nil' Chance 


Diane Cardinale, a spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an 
industry trade association, is equally discouraging. Asked about the difficulty 
of launching a new game, she said, "I would say your chances are practically 
nil." 


Despite all that, a San Diego landscape architect turned game inventor named 
Craig E. Allison thinks that he can defy the odds. Allison and his partners 
conceived and developed this summer Strokeamoby, a board game that tries to 
capture the excitement and disappointment of trying to catch the big one in a 
bass-fishing tournament. 


Strokeamoby boasts sponsorship of the sport's biggest promoters, including the 
Future Fisherman Foundation. Those imprimaturs, combined with the game's 
peculiar name ("stroke a Moby" is fishing jargon for landing a hefty female 
bass) should attract a significant percentage of the millions of this country's 
fresh-water fishermen, Allison said. 


Allison's game will not be available to the public until June. Because giant 
manufacturers hardly ever accept ideas from novice game makers, such 
entrepreneurs as Allison usually pay for initial production and distribution on 
their own. He and his partners said they are ready to invest $200,000 to pay 
for the manufacturing and marketing of their game through sporting goods, bait 
and tackle shops. 


The investors' hope is that Strokeamoby will sell well enough at $19.95 a game 
that they will be in a position to sell the game to such major manufacturers as 
Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley, receiving royalties from future sales. 


A nice scenario, to be sure, but industry experts said the odds of success are 
stacked against Allison. 


"You can't imagine how many people call us every day believing that they have 
the idea, the next Trivial Pursuit," said Stacy Botwinick, associate editor of 
Playthings, a leading toy and games industry magazine based in New York. "But 
the truth is, nobody is going to buy an idea." 


The inventor, if no one else, remains optimistic. Allison, who has been 
successful with a new game once before, is confident that he has a winner. 


Besides finding a novel concept, he has already covered other game-launching 
steps, such as financing and distribution. 


And he thinks that he has found a rich vein of potential customers. Unlike 
other sports such as baseball and football, which have more than their share of 
games, fishing has been overlooked by the game industry, said Allison, who got 
into the business when he tried to create a one-of-a-kind game for his children 
a couple of years ago. 


"At first, I was a little skeptical about the idea too," said Allison, who was 
approached by bass fishermen who were co-workers at his landscape architecture 
firm. They were interested in seeing their sport in a board game. 


After some research, he discovered Americans' love affair with fishing. "That's 
when I realized that there was potential for a huge marketplace," Allison said. 


If his game is stocked at bait and tackle shops and sporting goods stores, he 
said, fishermen can pick up Strokeamoby along with a new fishing rod. 


"Have you ever hung around with fishermen? These people can't leave a tackle 
store without buying something," he said. 




Still No Guarantee 


Allison may have found a niche, but that does not mean the people in the niche 
will buy his game, Carlat noted: "I'm a basketball freak, but that doesn't mean 
I'm going to go out and buy Larry Bird's basketball board game." 


At first glance, the success of games such as Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary 
would seem to have helped board games regain the popularity they lost with the 
advent of video games in the early 1980s. In 1988, for example, board game 
sales were $512 million, according to Toy Manufacturers of America, up sharply 
from $377 million in 1982, when video games had their most profound impact. 


As a result, many game inventors now think that selling board games is a path 
to riches. Not so, Carlat said. 


"Besides Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary, how many other hot board games can you 
name?" he asked. "The sales of those two games have really skewed the picture. 


"It's so difficult to attract board game buyers. You're competing against so 
many other things, against movies and other leisure-time activities. People 
don't seem to realize that games like Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary come along 
maybe once in a lifetime." 


Nevertheless, game inventors, large and small, are introducing many 
adult-oriented board games. 


"What Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary have done is opened the board game 
manufacturers' eyes to the adult market," Carlat said. 


Pursuing the older game player also allows game makers to recoup sales they 
have lost to video-game manufacturers. Children's games retail for about $10, 
and most adult games sell for $20 to $30. 


As a result, industry officials expect plenty of Trivial Pursuit clones or 
"social interaction" games to appear on store shelves. 


"When something pops in the toy business," Carlat said, "then every major 
company will come up with a similar product and try to ride the bandwagon. What 
you get is a tremendous oversaturation, and then everybody suffers. 


"I'm afraid that's what we're beginning to see. People in the game business are 
notorious for killing the golden goose." 


With game inventors rushing to pitch their winning ideas to manufacturers, 
industry experts said selling a game concept, traditionally a difficult task, 
will become even harder. 


"Selling a game idea is probably one of the hardest things to do," said 
Cardinale, the Toy Manufacturers of America spokeswoman. 


Because major manufacturers have a staff of game inventors, they rarely accept 
unsolicited ideas, she said. 




Sticking With Their Own 


"Besides, if they take outside ideas, they would have to pay the inventor 
royalties," she said. "If one of their own comes up with a winner, all they 
have to do is pay that person his regular salary." 


Cardinale added: "You have to realize that a manufacturer puts a lot of money 
behind the introduction of a new product. They're not going to take a risk on 
an unproven concept." 


So how does a novice game inventor get a game out on the market? 


"Go out and pound the pavement," said Botwinick, the associate editor of 
Playthings. "Go store to store in your neighborhood. You've got to start small. 
Until you can prove that your product sells, you won't be able to get the 
attention of the big game makers." 


In addition, industry experts strongly urge aspiring game inventors to attend 
toy fairs -- particularly the one sponsored by the Toy Manufacturers of America 
-- where retailers and buyers come in droves, hoping to find next year's 
best-seller. 


"Essentially, if you want to get something to the American buyer, you have to 
come to our show," Cardinale said. The group's show is the largest toy trade 
fair in the United States -- second-largest in the world -- and attracts more 
than 17,000 buyers and 1,100 exhibitors annually. 




Advertising Space on Board 


Allison plans to attend TMA's toy fair as well as other exhibition shows but 
said his planned "instant-distribution network" will allow him to worry less 
about finding distributors at such fairs. He is trying to sell 16 game spaces 
on his game board as ad slots for fishing equipment manufacturers. 


"According to my plan, the manufacturer actually becomes part of the board 
game," Allison said. "A player could land on a certain spot that actually 
features a manufacturer's logo. 


"Whoever buys advertising space will have a vested interest in having the game 
do well. The manufacturer can sell the game to his established network of 
dealers, along with his other products. Once I get manufacturers to advertise 
on my game, I get an instant-distribution network." 


Allison has contacted more than 300 fishing equipment manufacturers in hope of 
landing their ads on his board. The inventor is charging $100,000 per game 
space and has not yet signed any advertisers. But he emphasized that he and his 
partners will put up $200,000 of their own money to pay for the game if the 
"distribution network" idea fails. 


About a year ago, Allison -- in a partnership he has since left -- started a 
board game called Skaters Only for skateboarders, using the same 
instant-distribution concept. Eight skateboard equipment manufacturers paid 
$8,000 each to advertise on the board. The partnership declined to say how the 
game is faring now. 


Whether Allison will succeed this time remains uncertain, but "what he's trying 
to do is certainly a very acceptable strategy," Carlat said. 


More important, industry experts said Allison has the right "mental approach" 
for the game-launching business. 


"Sure, I would love to be a millionaire," Allison said. "But I'm not greedy. 
Trying to develop a game is a game in itself. I'm having fun doing this."

The Reverend Green is dead. His place among the murder suspects in the
Cluedo set is to be taken by a businessman. Green's fans jammed the
switchboard of the game's UK licensee when the news leaked out this week.
But when you unwrap the family Christmas game this year, you will find that
he is not the only victim of changing fashion.
This year's seasonal releases include new versions of those old favourites,
Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. They are joined by, among others, a growing
number which hark back to the British tradition of parlour games.
The tried and trusted Christmas games are both repackaged this Christmas.
There is a Trivial Pursuit - The Annual Edition, to celebrate the game's
tenth birthday, containing questions culled from events of the last year.
There is no board. Instead, there is the usual pie and a die with coloured
dots for categories. This keeps the price down but removes the last vestiges
of tactics.
Since it is rarely possible to deduce the answers to Pursuit questions, this
is essentially a game of luck. Furthermore, like all trivia games, it
favours adults who have had more time to accumulate the debris of modern
society more than children and, in this version, adults who are obsessed
with Madonna most of all. There are also three different versions of the
full set with board (Pounds 43), a travel version, additional specialist
boxes of question cards and sets of CD and cassette questions (Pounds 15).
In Euromonopoly (Pounds 29.95), the EC version for 1993, the dark blue
properties (the most expensive) are, unsurprisingly, German: Berlin's
Kurfurstendam and the Konigsallee. Strangely, the two cheap brown ones are
Danish. The currency is Ecus, the playing pieces are the Eiffel Tower, the
Tower of Pisa, and so on. But the game is played exactly the same way. It is
a pretty tackily made version of the old favourite, but you can always buy
Standard Monopoly (Pounds 15), Deluxe Monopoly (Pounds 25) or Pocket
Monopoly (Pounds 9) instead.
The latest Trivial Pursuit may have dropped the board but imitations crop up
everywhere. Both Pictionary (Pounds 32.95) and Articulate (Pounds 24.95)
come with boxes of question cards and boards divided into coloured segments.
Both also owe a large debt to charades.
At least with Outburst (Pounds 33.95), the board is black and white. All
three games contain little plastic egg-timers which break easily. Articulate
is the least-well made and accordingly the least expensive.
All three are really rather fun. They fit into the booming category of rowdy
team games. In Pictionary, players must communicate words to team-mates with
drawings, in Articulate they must explain as many words as quickly as
possible and in Outburst, teams must name as many words in a category as
quickly as possible.
Pictionary is not for those sensitive about their art. Drawings are subject
to ridicule, but even bad drawings can be communicative. It is amazing what
stick men can do.
Articulate is, for the most part, a test of quick wits and word-power but a
team can run aground on questions of general knowledge - if you do not know
what the Maldives are, you cannot explain them to team mates.
There are other, inferior, variations on this theme. Pazzazz, which is not a
team game, comes with what looks like a set of clockwork dentures instead of
an eggtimer. This flops over at the end of a player's timed turn of naming
words in a category. If you do not want a set of jumping teeth, you
certainly will not want the whirring, plastic clapperboard which comes with
Guesstures (Pounds 33.95), a reworking of charades. Save your money and play
the original.
One cheeky repackaging of an old parlour game that is worth the money is Ex
Libris (Pounds 10.95). It contains a well-disguised set of rules and a pack
of cards. These offer plot synopses of novels. Players, if they do not know
the real first or last lines, write down versions of their own devising and
then try to guess the right one.
Once you have used the entire pack, you can start working your way through
paperbacks on your shelves. It is immense fun. Even the best-read will be
surprised at how little they remember, while the least bookish can show a
surprising literary flair.
Apart from the many repackagings of Monopoly and Cluedo (Pounds 14.95)
old-fashioned board games are rare. The biggest British games manufacturers
are obsessed with jumping teeth and do not believe old-fashioned games will
sell to the Nintendo generation.
The worthwhile exceptions include Fair Means or Foul (Pounds 17) from
Germany, where such games still sell well. It takes antique collecting as
its metaphor, so it is full of rather pretty playing cards showing antiques
and modern works of art. Players collect sets of art by outbidding opponents
or stealing from them. But if you spend too much time building a collection
rather than moving your piece, you might be too far behind at the end.
This is a nicely designed, testing and infuriating game which can occupy a
couple of nerve-wracking hours in comparative quiet and allow children a
good chance of beating their parents. The same goes for Hare and Tortoise
(Pounds 17), a British game, in which a gift for mental arithmetic is
helpful but not essential as you try to calculate how many carrots your
rabbit needs to hop round the course.
One way games companies are trying to compete with the video and computer
games is by putting games on video tape. The most heavily advertised is
Atmosfear (Pounds 32.95), a board game which has the advantage of taking
exactly the 60 minutes the tape lasts. Players race around a graveyard
collecting six keys by luck rather than skill. Every so often, an
over-the-top actor playing 'the gatekeeper' snarls instructions from the
screen. As the game goes on, he grows more over-the-top, his make-up
thickens and his growls become louder and more frequent. Good fun for
teenage children and their friends following the Christmas Eve visit to the
pub after which it will probably be forgotten.
Another video game is 221b Baker Street. The video offers badly-acted but
entertainingly scripted little snippets of plot but is little more than a
decoration of the board game of the same name (Pounds 15) - a sophisticated
variation on Cluedo. Fans of the great detective might also enjoy the rather
quirky card game Sherlock Holmes (Pounds 8.95) which contains elements of
the old card game Hearts. It is most entertaining if players announce plot
developments in a Dr Watson voice as they play each card.
The obsession with detectives has carried over into the ultimate
dinner-party game: the murder evening. Players take the parts of suspects in
a murder and play out their roles over a meal. The leaders in this field are
the How to Host a Murder (Pounds 23) series. The box includes a cast list,
so you can invite the most suitable of your friends for each role.,
You begin the evening with a tape in which you are told by a policeman that
you are suspects in a murder and may not leave. The players spend the meal
wheedling secrets out of each other. Each has a booklet of information their
character knows, after each course they turn the page to find out more,
after dessert they turn to the solution.
It can make for an entertaining evening if everyone enters into the spirit,
but it can be trying for the host, running in and out with food and missing
clues. One strange aspect of some of the games is that the murderer does not
know he or she has done it until the last turn (or course).
The How To games run through the usual gamut of Agatha Christie country
houses and train journeys.
For those with a large wardrobe of Lycra tunics and nylon slacks, there is a
Star Trek mystery, but you can only play each mystery once. It is also
impossible to make real conversation while you are playing a game - perhaps
that makes it more attractive for a family Christmas.
Retail prices of games vary greatly. Those quoted are from Harrods, for
games it stocks, or specialist shops Just Games and Esdevium Games. Both of
these offer mail order; Esdevium Games, 6 Wellington St, Aldershot, Hants,
GU11 1DZ, tel: 0252- 311443; Just Games, 71 Brewer St, London W1R, 3FB, tel:
071-734-6124.

GAMES: FOCUS ON NATURE; 


PLAYING GAMES WITH MOTHER NATURE 




By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




"The happiest adults," said Picasso, "are doing what they did as kids." 


And what do kids do? Play games. If one tableau for the Acquisitive '80s found 
them hunched over Monopoly or the Trump game or the Wall Street game or 
Acquire, a metaphor for the '90s may be a kinder, gentler competition across a 
game board that teaches environmental principals. 


The "environmental decade" is spawning an array of games, usually made from 
recycled or recyclable materials, that teach an appreciation of nature. 


Some, such as Birding! -- developed by Robert Huffman, a copywriter for a 
Detroit publishing company -- are niche games, available only through 
conservation group catalogues or specialty shops. 


Spurred by his twin interests in bird-watching and game-playing, Huffman, 33, 
spent four years creating his board game, which simulates a day of 
bird-watching in the marshes and wetland woods of Point Pelee National Park in 
Ontario. 


"The pawns for my game are made out of wood, because I didn't want to use 
plastic," he said. 


"The game encourages people to stay on trails because groups have destroyed the 
vegetation. It doesn't just teach bird-watching, it also encourages ethical 
behavior that is in again. After the 'me' generation of the '80s, people are 
getting this feeling back." 


Huffman isn't sure how widespread this new selflessness is, but "green" games 
that teach people about recycling, geography, animals and plants are showing up 
across the boards. 


"We are seeing a lot of new games that create involvement in nature," said 
Donna Baker Schwenk, a reviewer of educational materials for the National 
Wildlife Federation. Its new catalogue features Save the Forest, in which 
players follow a path through a forest, collecting litter, caring for animals 
and learning about their habitats. At the National Geographic Society, Barbara 
Fallon reports that the ongoing success of Global Pursuit -- in which players 
assemble pieces of a world map and answer trivia questions about the globe -- 
has spurred the development of On Assignment With National Geographic. 


"It's a family game, and you take on the role of a National Geographic 
photographer," she said. "It will be out next October for National Geographic 
members, or can be ordered. It won't be available through stores." 


But the games are also sprouting in stores outside the environmental niche. And 
while nobody is suggesting that Save the Forest will edge out Pictionary as the 
game of choice on a rainy afternoon, casual investigation reveals a coming 
wave. 


"It's a trend, I'm telling you it's there," says Diana Huss Green, 
editor-in-chief of the quarterly magazine Parents' Choice. She shopped this 
year's mammoth New York Toy Fair, sponsored by the Toy Manufacturers of 
America, and came away with evidence that toy land is taking on an eco-tinge. 
Green ticked off some of the upcoming entries: 


* Pollution Solution, from Aristoplay, in which each player owns a section of 
the township and, confronted with a series of pollution problems, such as 
"overburdened septic tanks pollute lake and drinking wells," has to come up 
with solutions, such as "sanitary sewer system is installed." 


* Save the World, from Crown and Andrews, in which players guide endangered 
species across a world map and attempt to develop a better ecological balance. 


* Colorful Kingdom, from Family Games, for children, in which players try to 
match exotic animals with their desert, jungle or ocean habitat. 


* Endangered, from Family Games, for older children and adults, in which 
participants travel to various countries to help save endangered species. 


* Don't Bug Me, from Game Inventors of America, in which players race around 
the board, competing with other farmers to grow vegetables and ward off insects 
that threaten crops. 


Although the real evidence won't be in until Christmas, when 60% percent of 
toys and games are sold, Green gives the new games high marks for their fun 
factor. 


"They are competitive, and that's important. A game has to offer something to 
win, and it's just as much fun for kids if they win at solving pollution than 
at those horrible '80s games when the competition was to get the most money." 


She sees the whole board game category as reflective of society. 


"These games are telling me about values: that the most educated and affluent 
parents in history want to buy their children the tools of childhood that 
reflect their own values. 


"It speaks very well for environmental concern." 


At the Nature Company's 40 stores, environmental games such as Eco-lotto and 
Insect Dominos are becoming staples. "They're a trend which we think will only 
go up on the chart," says spokesman Michael Modzelewski. "We can barely keep 
them in the stores." 


Nature Company market research shows the typical customer to be a "slightly 
over-educated couple who are very interested in their children," Modzelewski 
said, "and games are important for setting values. I think they realize that 
even the mobile hanging over a crib or the animal painted on the wall are 
educational within themselves. 


"As we go toward the new millennium, the '90s are the decade of trying to save 
the Earth." 


But in the larger world of commerce, where companies generally acknowledge less 
lofty goals, "green" games are eyed with some skepticism. "A board game where 
everybody who cleans up the garbage wins, doesn't sound like much fun to me," 
suggested one industry expert. 


Dennis Murray, the manager of Gamesmanship in South Coast Plaza, with 4,000 
square feet of nothing but board games, says he has not seen a trend yet: "To 
get something that gets big-big in this country, you have to have the big money 
-- get the major manufacturer behind it," he said. 


And at the Toy Manufacturers of America, the industry trade association, Jodi 
Levin reported that "environmental games" do not warrant their own category in 
the $13.4-billion toy industry. 


"On the other hand, trends like this sometimes start out very small in our 
industry and end up being huge," she added. "The trivia trend started that 
way." 


Other observers recall a slew of wholesome "safety" games for children -- with 
titles such as Don't Talk to Strangers -- that were introduced a few years ago 
but never took off. "The play value wasn't there," says Mike Agrelius, director 
of Game Inventors of America, a Texas-based umbrella group for about 150 small 
companies. "We play games to escape, not to learn." His company is marketing 
Don't Bug Me, which is becoming their bestseller, just on the basis of advance 
orders, he said. "It teaches math skills and decision-making skills, but it's 
not successful because it's educational. 


"It's successful because it's fun."

BOARD GAME POKES FUN AT TV EVANGELISTS 




From Religious News Service 




If you're a cynical secularist or a Christian with a sense of humor, a new 
board game might be just the thing to help you recover from the televangelism 
scandals. 


Titled "Fleece the Flock," it's the brainchild of three Connecticut residents 
who formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions for the venture. Elizabeth Fuller of 
Weston, a Unitarian, originated the idea and teamed up with inventor Stanley 
Mason of Weston and illustrator Roy Doty of Norwalk -- both of whom are United 
Methodists -- to create the game. It is produced and marketed by Regent 
Continental in Pennsylvania. 


Each player starts with $50 million in play money and a miniature collection 
plate to move around the board. There are angel, devil and God's will cards 
that help or hinder the players as they seek to build televangelism empires. 


"In no way it is against religion," Fuller says of the game, which sells for 
$25. "It's a board game that pokes fun at the TV evangelists who have been 
taking advantage of innocent people." 


The game originator says she is surprised at the amount of publicity the game 
has been getting in national media. She believes it indicates that "people have 
had it with these hucksters."

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


PURVEYORS of Britain's board games must have blanched at the news of fights
breaking out among several thousand youngsters locked out of a computer
games exhibition in London earlier this month.
It is not the sort of thing that happens in the staid world of
non-electronic games, where Monopoly (circa 1930) remains the number one
seller, followed by old rivals Cluedo (circa 1950), Scrabble and the newer
Trivial Pursuit.
'The traditional board games offer a good value way of bridging the
generation gap and in which all the family can participate,' says Mr Alan
Thompson, managing director of Waddington Games, makers of Monopoly.
'Computer games are usually designed for single players.'
However, the new wave of electronic entertainment has dented the growth in
board game sales, although they have held up well in the face of the
recession.
Last year, board game sales grew to Pounds 127m from Pounds 114m in 1988,
with Monopoly selling 300,000 units - and Junior Monopoly an additional
200,000.
New growth areas are generally limited to one-off blockbusters such as
Trivial Pursuit, or adaptations from television game shows. Hence healthy
sales are expected this Christmas for the likes of 'Big Break', 'Give us a
Clue' and 'TV Addicts'. Toy executives maintain close contacts with
television companies, producing a two-way stream of games linked to TV and
vice versa.
Meanwhile, Subbuteo, the table football game, has seen a seven-fold increase
in sales in the past six years, mirroring renewed interest in the domestic
game. There has also been a flood of games on the 'Dungeons and Dragons'
theme.
However, a stroll down the aisle of any large toy store reveals hundreds of
board games lacking either the pull of television support or the staying
power of the established giants. One cannot help but fear a short shelf life
for the likes of 'Mall Madness' and 'Beware the Bog]'.
The cost of introducing new games is high, with its success dependent on
good distribution. Periphery players also struggle because with two-thirds
of sales made in the Christmas period, large amounts of stock have to be
held throughout the year. 'I think the industry will become centred around
fewer players,' says Mr Thompson. Experienced toy industry watchers predict
a New Year fall-out for some of the smaller manufacturers.
One of the few new companies to make in-roads into the UK market is the
Japanese group Tomy, which in the past 10 years has seen its sales grow from
zero to Pounds 60m.
With no traditional board game as a backbone, Tomy has concentrated on
developing activity games with an emphasis on skill and dexterity. 'There's
nothing more boring than a flat piece of cardboard,' says Mr Peter Brown,
managing director of Tomy UK. 'People, and especially children, want
something extra to do while they're playing.'
But despite Tomy's efforts to widen the market, the search for the lucrative
'new Monopoly' continues to exercise not only some of the great minds of the
toy world, but also the British public.
Mr Brown says he receives up to a dozen suggestions a week from the public
for new board games. At Waddingtons the number of suggestions regularly runs
to a hundred. In the meantime, Monopoly looks likely to live up to its title
and maintain its dominant position.

LONDON CLUBS, the owner of six London casinos facing the loss of gaming
licences, is in talks to reassure its backers, which include banks,
institutions and private investors.
The casino group intends to make a vigorous defence of its record before
South Westminster Licencing Magistrates next month. It can only do so,
however, provided its financial backers - led by the Royal Bank of Scotland
 -stand firm.
The management of London Clubs is confident that the allegations made by the
police and the Gaming Board, in declaring the company 'not fit and proper'
to hold gaming licences, can be answered.
The immediate danger facing the company is that investors may attempt to
dispose of the properties to another operator rather than run the risk of
cancellation of licences and the loss of all London Clubs' casinos.
Given the uncertainty over their future, selling the casinos would be likely
to realise only a fraction of their real worth. Investors may stand a better
chance of saving their money if London Clubs has the opportunity of
defending its licences, as it believes it can, in open court.
If London Clubs was successful in securing renewal of its licences, either
at the magistrates' hearing or on appeal to the Crown Court, its future
would be very bright.
The action by police and the Gaming Board in applying for cancellation and
non-renewal of licences comes as a further blow to the already beleaguered
British gaming industry. There is a shortage of the 'high rollers' created
partly by recession and partly by uncertainty in the Middle East, where many
such gamblers come from.
The provisions in the Budget to speed up payment of taxes are a further blow
to cash flow.
There is a sense in the industry that the Gaming Board - with a new
secretary and about to have a new chairman - is no longer as closely in
touch with the industry.

MR JOHN ASPINALL, the casino operator, has objected to the application by
London Clubs, the casino group that owns the Ritz Club and Les Ambassadeurs
in the capital, for renewal of its gaming licences.
The objection by Mr Aspinall has come as a surprise to London Clubs, which
had hoped that the hearing of its application by magistrates on October 19
would proceed smoothly after the Gaming Board's recent decision to grant
certificates of consent for its six casinos. Certificates of consent
indicate that the board considers a casino fit to operate and paves the way
for magistrates to grant gaming licences.
Mr Aspinall, whose new casino opens in London on October 20, argues that
approval of new licences for London Clubs is such an important decision for
British gaming that the issues ought to be aired in open court.
London Clubs, whose future had been clouded by uncertainty after a police
raid on its Mayfair casinos in June last year, has undergone a
transformation under its new chairman, Sir Gordon Booth, a former diplomat.
The company has always denied any wrongdoing.
After the previous management team, led by Mr Max Kingsley, resigned at the
end of April, new directors were brought in and efforts were made to meet
the Gaming Board objections to the company's operating procedures.
One decision was to stop granting complimentary services for overseas
players, such as payment of air fares and hotel bills, a practice understood
to have worried the Gaming Board, although the company had claimed the
practice was perfectly proper.
The new management convinced the Gaming Board that it was 'fit and proper'
to keep its licences and was granted certificates of consent for its six
casinos, which are now set up as separate units instead of as a single
entity. The company had assumed that the police would take the same view as
the board and not pursue their objections.
While the new licences are expected to be granted, the future of London
Clubs remains dependent on the magistrates' hearing.
Mr Aspinall's intervention is thought unlikely to alter the outcome but may
lengthen the hearing.

THE POLICE and the Gaming Board have applied to magistrates for cancellation
and non-renewal of gaming licences held by London Clubs, calling the company
'not fit and proper' to manage casinos - the gravest charge in British
gaming regulations.
The decision follows a raid in June on the main casinos owned by London
Clubs. Detailed grounds for the action, which run to several pages, were
given to London Clubs' management yesterday.
London Clubs' casinos include the Ritz Club in Piccadilly and the recently
opened Les Ambassadeurs at the end of Park Lane. It also manages the Carlton
casino in Cannes.
The company, which has vigorously denied any wrong-doing, intends to defend
its record point by point in the licensing hearing, expected to start late
next month.
Mr Max Kingsley, managing director of London Clubs, said last night: 'Now
that we have seen the grounds for the objections our position is simply that
we have found nothing in them that would justify cancellation or non-renewal
of our licences. We shall be fighting the case all the way.'
The hearing is expected to last four or five weeks.
Disposal of the properties to a new operator would be difficult to arrange,
after recent Gaming Board moves to tighten up the transfer of licences. If
the magistrates granted cancellation the premises could not be used for
gambling for three years.
Annual profits of London Clubs are estimated at Pounds 20m. The recession
has made life tougher for casinos, but London Clubs' managers claim they are
holding their own.
The raid in June came days before a planned flotation of shares in London
Clubs - 250 police and the Gaming Board inspectorate went into the clubs and
removed about 60,000 documents.
The Gaming Board declined to have any contact with the company to explain
its action, until yesterday's official decision to proceed against it.
What the police were looking for has never been revealed. The detailed
grounds given yesterday are understood to cover eight different matters,
only one of which is claimed to be a breach of the Gaming Act.

TRUMP MOVES FROM BOARD ROOMS TO A BOARD GAME 




From Associated Press 




NEW YORK 




Billionaire businessman Donald Trump today extended the art of the deal from 
board rooms to board games by teaming with Milton Bradley Co. to announce Trump 
The Game, whose object is to make the most money. 


The game, which will retail for about $25 when it hits stores this spring, is 
played with Trump money -- in denominations of no less than $10 million -- that 
bears the deal-maker's likeness. 


Trump said he would keep no profits from sales of the board game. 


"From the Trump standpoint, all of the profits we make will go toward 
charities," said Trump, standing in front of a 10-foot tall replica of a Trump 
The Game box during a news conference in the pink marble atrium of Trump Tower 
in Manhattan. 


Milton Bradley executives and Trump declined to detail fee or royalty 
agreements associated with the deal. 


"I am acting as an agent for charities," said Trump, who listed organizations 
for multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, AIDS and the homeless as among those 
that would receive his share of profits from the game. 


Milton Bradley, a division of Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro Inc., is promoting 
the game with a 30-second TV commercial featuring Trump and believes the 
product "will be the game of the '90s," said George Ditomassi, president of 
Milton Bradley.

TO the great relief of its bankers and investors, and even more so its
croupiers, London Clubs International has made a clean sweep in securing new
gaming licences for its London casinos.
Last week the company was granted a new licence for the Sportsman in
Tottenham Court Road, having previously won new licences for its four
Mayfair casinos - the Ritz Club, Les Ambassadeurs, the Rendezvous and the
Palm Beach, plus the Golden Nugget in Piccadilly. Together, the six casinos
account for about two fifths of the drop (money wagered) in the capital's
casinos, which totals more than Pounds 1bn a year.
As it happened, those events coincided with the arrival of a new chairman at
the Gaming Board, Lady Littler, formerly an assistant under-secretary of
state.
A new phase appears to be dawning in British gaming.
The London Clubs case is significant in that a new procedure has been
introduced in casino regulation.
In nearly all previous cases when casino management was judged by the police
and Gaming Board as 'not fit and proper' - the verdict on London Clubs in
March this year after an earlier raid on its Mayfair casinos - the company
went out of business. Its assets were sold or transferred to a new operator.
London Clubs found a different way to play the hand. The company decided to
seek new certificates of consent after talks between the company's
non-executive directors - who were anxious to save the banks' and other
investors' money - and the Gaming Board.
If successful, it could apply for new licences, while agreeing, at the same
time, to relinquish its existing - allegedly tainted - licences.
The licensing hearings were informed that London Clubs had been completely
restructured, with a new chairman - Sir Gordon Booth, a former diplomat -
new directors, new shareholders, new managers and new methods of compliance.
In due course, new licences were granted.
Other operators in the gaming industry are interpreting the case as a
precedent, but that is not the view of the Gaming Board.
Its officials maintain that they were 'very confident' of their case against
London Clubs and were prepared to substantiate charges against the company,
had the licensing justices so ruled.
The issue may yet go to court if Mr John Aspinall, the rival casino owner,
succeeds in his appeal to the High Court that granting new licences in this
way was an evasion of the Gaming Act.
Lady Littler says the board will not hesitate to attack casino licences
where necessary and justifiable. But she adds that the board 'does not seek
the closure of casinos, with all that that would entail, merely as a
punitive measure, if problems can be eliminated effectively and propriety
restored by less draconian measures'.
London Clubs is delighted to retain its position as the capital's leading
casino group; the board is satisfied it has achieved its regulatory
objectives in full; and casino staff are relieved to keep their jobs.

SIX of the senior management of London Clubs, the troubled casino group, are
to resign in an attempt to safeguard the future of the company's six casinos
and their 2,300 staff.
In a message to staff, Mr Max Kingsley, chairman and managing director, said
yesterday that he and five of his senior colleagues would leave London Clubs
on April 30.
His brief statement said: 'Since we have each served the company for well in
excess of 20 years, we leave with great reluctance and regret, but do so in
the hope that our departure will prove to be in the best interests of the
majority of the company's employees.'
The decision follows a series of emergency meetings of the main investors,
led by Standard Chartered, the lead bank. It was seen as the best way of
meeting police and Gaming Board objections to renewal of the licences for
London Clubs's six casinos after a raid on the main London casinos last
June.
London Clubs' casinos include the Ritz Club in Piccadilly and the recently
opened Les Ambassadeurs at the end of Park Lane. It also manages the Carlton
casino in Cannes.
Yesterday's announcement is likely to be regarded in the industry as a
high-risk strategy because its success depends on satisfying the police and
the Gaming Board, which claim that the company is 'not fit and proper' to
keep its casino licences.
Mr Kingsley is known to have preferred to defend the company's record in
court. Departure of the top management is not an admission in any way that
operation of the clubs was in breach of the gaming regulations. The
licensing hearings are due to open on October 19.
A group of banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, Security Pacific Merchant
Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Anstalt and Mitsui Trust, financed the
company's Pounds 125m buy-out from Grand Metropolitan in 1989. The banks'
determination to safeguard as much of their investment as they could appears
to have been the deciding factor.
They stand to lose about Pounds 55m if the group's casinos were to lose
their licences, which would lead to the premises being disbarred from
gaming.
The police and Gaming Board's objections are believed to focus on the
industry's own guidelines for conduct, with only one alleged infringement of
the Gaming Act, relating to credit. London Clubs has denied any wrongdoing.
Another issue that is understood to have worried the Gaming Board concerns
complimentary services to attract foreign players (prohibited for British
punters), such as funding air fares and hotel bills. Without that practice,
which London Clubs claims is perfectly proper, the company might lose 15 per
cent to 20 per cent of its turnover.

46.9m unsolicited bid for JW Spear, the British company which owns rights to
the board game outside North America.
Scrabble, which ranks alongside Monopoly as a board game known throughout
the world, is produced in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30
per cent of Spear's Pounds 38.7m turnover. This year the company is planning
to introduce versions in Turkish and Hungarian.
Hasbro had sales of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1993. It has owned
Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented more than 50
years ago, since 1989.
It has been the UK company's biggest shareholder outside the Spear family
interests for the past four years, with 26.7 per cent. The trustees of some
Spear family trusts have given undertakings to accept the Hasbro bid in
respect of a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings become irrevocable next
Friday if a higher offer is not received.
Hasbro is offering 900p a share, a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.
The Spear board will meet this morning to consider the bid. The company,
which in March raised its final dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a 22
per cent rise in profits to Pounds 4.51m, is expected to find the offer
inadequate.
Mr Francis Spear, chairman, would make no comment last night, although he
dismissed any idea of a family row. Mr Paul Lipscomb, finance director, said
the bid had come like a bolt from the blue.
Spear's other products include Atmosfear, a board game linked to a video,
and more traditional pastimes such as Snakes and Ladders.
Mr Alan Hassenfeld, chairman of Hasbro, said the acquisition would be 'a
logical extension of Hasbro's strategy to develop and expand its core
operations around the world'.
The origins of Scrabble lie in the 1930s when it was developed as a
crossword game by Alfred Butts, a New York architect whose practice was in
trouble after the Wall Street crash.
It was launched as Scrabble in 1949 after almost two decades of rejection by
leading games players as too highbrow. The game took off in the 1950s after
the chairman of Macy's department store in New York became hooked and placed
a large order.
Mr Butts, a poor speller, earned only a 5 cent royalty on each set.
Nevertheless, at the peak sales levels in the late 1950s and 1960s, he was
getting about Dollars 50,000 a year.

COMPUTAINMENT: DELUXE SCRABBLE SCORES WITH NONTRADITIONALISTS 




By JEANE deCOSTER and DAVID CROOK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 




Virgin Mastertronics' "The Deluxe Computer Edition of Scrabble" trades away 
much of the familiar appeal of the classic board game for some intriguing bells 
and whistles. Serious players looking to exercise their skills and stretch 
their vocabularies probably will embrace the new features. 


But traditionalists will long for the competition, surprise and camaraderie 
possible only between human players. 


In its most basic form, this computer version of Scrabble -- actually a totally 
redesigned update of an earlier electronic version of the game -- closely 
resembles the actual board game. After fellow players -- human or computer -- 
and difficultly levels are chosen, random letters are assigned to each player. 


Words are formed and placed on the board in the same way you would with actual 
tiles. A very welcome calculating feature keeps track of the point values for 
all levels of scoring. 


Unfortunately, however, the computer version doesn't do a very good job of 
hiding tiles. Whether playing the computer or another human, it is all but 
impossible not to know what your opponent has in his/her/its rack. Using the 
hide feature doesn't help much either. 


We also found a lot to be desired with the huge (2.5 megabytes) dictionary 
program that comes with the game: golfer and offer for two. The game makers 
promised the entire "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary," but our trusty 
1979 paperback edition turned out to be a bit more complete than the 1990 
electronic one. 


"Deluxe Computer Scrabble" has enough pluses to make it as a good solitaire 
game, but it is definitely not a substitute for an evening with the original 
board game and a couple of good friends. 




Photo, DELUXE SCRABBLE Rating: *** IBM &amp; compatibles, Tandy 1000; 640K. 
List: $59.95 Computer games are rated on a five-star system, from one star for 
poor to five for excellent.

NEWPORT BEACH VERSION; 


IS A GAME BY ANY OTHER NAME NOT A MONOPOLY? 




By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 




Bet you thought monopolies were illegal. 


Well, they usually are -- unless it's the monopoly on Monopoly. 


Parker Brothers says it has the rights to the world's best-known board game and 
any obvious variations. And that includes Newportopoly, a takeoff on the 
original with Newport Beach business names. 


Newportopoly was a sellout hit at selected Orange County retail outlets last 
holiday season, and its local creators are gearing up to go into a second 
production run. 


In addition, the two partners of G&amp;L Enterprises of Laguna Beach say they 
are thinking about putting out a Los Angeles edition of the game and maybe 
additional versions based on other areas in Southern California. 


But Parker Brothers may have something to say about those plans. 


The Beverly, Mass., game manufacturer owns the copyright and trademark to 
Monopoly, the classic, wheeler-dealer board game invented in 1933 by Charles 
Darrow. 


Based on Atlantic City place names, Monopoly still earns Parker Brothers 
millions of dollars annually. In 1985, sales of the game in the United States 
alone netted the company $24 million. 


And according to Manhattan lawyer Steven Weinberg, who represents Parker 
Brothers, "the Monopoly (trademark and copyright) are alive and well and 
registered and enforceable. . . ." 


"The very fact that people call their games 'opoly' and set up a board to look 
like the Monopoly board indicates they're trying to ride off the reputation 
that Parker Brothers has in the Monopoly symbols," Weinberg said. 


Geoffrey A. Airey and Lacy Michelle Johnston -- the two young entrepreneurs who 
produced Newportopoly and founded G&amp;L Enterprises -- said they consulted an 
attorney about legalities before introducing their board game and were assured 
that it was all right. 


"One of our main concerns is that we weren't infringing on anyone else," 
Johnston said in an interview Tuesday. "We're not interested in getting into 
any problems here." 


Weinberg, it turns out, wasn't even aware of the existence of Newportopoly 
until a reporter called to ask about Parker Brothers' approval of that and 
similar ventures. It seems that the manufacturer gets calls "every day" from 
people who want to use the game or its trademark, said company spokeswoman 
Patricia McGovern. While some are approved, she said, "we very aggressively 
protect the Monopoly trademark." 


Weinberg said he cannot give an opinion on Newportopoly until he sees the game. 
But if Parker Brothers decides to challenge its production, it will be the 
latest in a series of hassles that G&amp;L Enterprises has had in producing the 
game. 


Johnston said she "had the idea in her head" for some time before she 
approached Airey last September about actually putting it out. She said she 
later learned that the idea wasn't exactly new. 


According to Weinberg, about 20 cities across the country have put out 
personalized real-estate board games, often to raise money for local civic 
groups. 


He said Parker Brothers objects only to those games that it considers 
"substantially similar" to Monopoly. 


The idea of personalizing the game to Newport Beach seemed a natural, Johnston 
said. "That's probably the most exclusive city in Orange County," she said. 
"People here identify with Newport Beach." 


The challenge: Start at go, produce the game and get it into stores with just a 
few months before Christmas. 


Armed with her concept only, Johnston began trotting to local businesses, 
explaining her idea and mentioning La Jollaopoly, a similar game based on La 
Jolla place names. La Jollaopoly was produced in 1987 by an unrelated company. 


Johnston concentrated on companies that would seem to want the sort of 
"long-term advertising" she was selling. For $350, she would print a business's 
name, telephone number and a small slogan on a Newportopoly space. The original 
idea was to produce 1,000 games. 


At first, the idea didn't exactly outsell hot cakes. Some businesses -- yacht 
brokers and beauty salons, for example -- just weren't interested. But others 
-- notably hotels, restaurants and an auto dealership -- were very enthusiastic 
indeed. 


"I like promotions that are community related, and I'm always looking for new 
ideas and creative things. This sounded workable," said Jim Wood, manager of 
Merrill Lynch Realty in Newport Beach 


Wood invested about $4,000. He paid $550 to be on the "Risk" space -- 
Newportopoly's equivalent of the "Chance" or "Community Chest" cards. The rest 
was to purchase 300 games at a wholesale price of $12 each to use as holiday 
promotions for Merrill Lynch clients. 


"It's great for kids because it's got local areas. And it's just different. 
It's not something that everybody has," said Mike Martin, owner of Balboa 
Pharmacy, which plunked down $350 for an orange space on the Newportopoly 
board. 


But after the 28 board spaces were sold, Johnston and Airey found that their 
problems were just beginning. 


For one thing, it turned out that everybody wanted to be on blue, green, yellow 
or red spaces. "People would say, 'You're not going to put me on the cheap 
spaces, are you?' " Johnston recalled. 


Then there were more practical problems: How do two recent UCLA graduates -- 
with backgrounds in sports medicine and economics -- come up with art? And a 
game board? Then a matching box, deed cards, instruction cards, fake money, and 
teensy red and green, plastic houses? And then, how to get it into the stores? 


But once the bugs were worked out, the game was a startling success. 


Instead of the 1,000 games Johnston and Airey originally planned to produce, 
they ended up making and selling their entire stock of 2,500 games. 


The games were carried at Nordstrom, Bernans in Costa Mesa, At Ease at Fashion 
Island and the Toy Shop in Corona del Mar. 


"It was fabulous. We sold 48 of them the first day we put them on the floor," 
said Peggy Zamberlan, general manager of Bernans. The children's department 
store ended up selling at least 130 of the games in about 4 days at $23 apiece, 
said Zamberlan. 


The initial printing of 2,500 games grossed Airey and Johnston about $26,000 -- 
about half of which was profit. 


According to their lawyer, Thomas Juettner, a copyright and trademark 
specialist with San Diego's Juettner, Pyle, Lloyd &amp; Verbeck, producing 
Newportopoly should be no problem from a legal standpoint. 


"Newportopoly is not a copy of Monopoly," the attorney said. "The idea for the 
game is the same, but the game is not. My clients did not copy the Monopoly 
game -- and copyright law protects expression of ideas. It doesn't protect 
ideas per se." 


Even so, to look at Newportopoly, there are some striking similarities to the 
original board game. 


G&amp;L's version, for instance, reproduces the Monopoly color combination on 
its board and the particular order of the properties. There are orange and 
yellow cards -- albeit called Risk and Newport Treasures instead of Chance and 
Community Chest. And just like Monopoly, the Newportopoly corners have squares 
marked "Go," "Free Parking," Just Visiting" with a cartoon of man behind bars, 
and "Go to Jail" with a cartoon of a policeman. 


Airey and Johnston are optimistic that their game is different enough that it 
won't cause a problem. For one thing, Johnston pointed out, the word 
Newportopoly is written horizontally across the board -- not diagonally, like 
the original game. And Newportopoly has a colored cartoon on its board -- 
whereas the original game has no such drawing. 


But Parker Brothers' lawyer says those differences may not mean much in the 
long run. 


Parker Brothers has valid copyright and trademark protection, he said. And as 
far as Juettner's argument that Newportopoly only borrows the Monopoly idea, 
"every defendant in every case in copyright always claims they're just using 
the idea. . . . That's the classic defense." 


In fact, Weinberg said, under copyright law, "the test is not how dissimilar" 
something is." Instead, "it's whether an ordinary person would believe that No. 
2 was copied from No. 1. Or are people likely to be confused into believing 
that Parker Brothers has sponsored, or is in some way connected with No. 2." 


"If the answer is yes," he said, "there's copyright infringement."

After the presents and Christmas pudding, environmental concerns may be far
from the thoughts of most holiday revellers - unless, of course, some
well-meaning gift-giver has placed an ecological board game under the tree.
In that case, the dilemmas of pollution may soon be bearing down over an
after-dinner game.
A simple roll of the dice in Pollution Solution, an ecological board game
for adults, could land a player in a tough spot. 'Farmers use electricity
from coal to run irrigation equipment,' reads one card ominously. The player
has to guess the solution printed on the back, which suggests that farmers
use windmill power instead.
Dozens of ecological board games are appearing in US toy and hobby shops,
and many are big sellers. Family Pastimes, a Canadian group which makes A
Beautiful Place, says it can hardly keep up with orders. Other manufacturers
include Aristoplay, Family Games and Ravensburg, a German-based group.
The names of the games are certainly catchy - Colourful Kingdom, Feeding
Frenzy, and Bottles &amp; Bins to name a few. Because the stated goal of the
games is to teach children and adults about the environment  - while having
fun, of course - the manufacturers have some clear messages to pass on. Most
of the games assure consumers that recycled materials were used 'wherever
possible'.
Many of the games are 'co-operative', meaning no one can lose - or win,
depending on how you look at it. 'When we recycle, everyone wins,' says the
box of the recycling game Bottles &amp; Bins. A Beautiful Place is more
sensational: 'Players work together, not against each other to restore
beauty. Can they do it before the looming Dark Clouds surround our special
Beautiful Place?'
A Beautiful Place has players clear away a Gotham-like drawing of a city,
piece by polluted piece. The players get points for good deeds, such as
turning off electric lights, planting a tree, or using public transport.
Feeding Frenzy tries to increase awareness about endangered sharks by
turning the players into sharks. There is no doubt who's the bad guy.
Players lose points based on scenarios such as: 'Humans hunt you for meat,
shark fin soup, oil, leather, and sometimes just for sport,' or: 'Toxic
Waste] Chemicals dumped by humans kill your prey.'
Humans do have an occasional soft spot: 'Humans lure you close by throwing
fresh meat overboard. You end up starring in a nature film. Congratulations]
You win five points.'
Some games may be guilty of over-simplifying environmental issues. Problem
26 of Pollution Solution, for instance, reads: 'Leaky faucets (taps) and
running toilets waste energy.' The easy answer? 'Residents fix plumbing.' Or
take Problem 12, which says: 'This section is overpopulated. Risks to
environment and health.' Solution? 'Couples agree to have no more than two
children.'
Players may take exception to manufacturers' opinions. One five-year-old
playing Colourful Kingdom, made by Family Games of Quebec, was disturbed at
the classification of a penguin as a 'water animal'.
It may be no coincidence that most of the games are aimed at youngsters.
Children seem especially receptive to the games, maybe because they can
blithely ignore the underlying political issues. After a lively game of
Bottles &amp; Bins, in which children try to sort plastic bottles, food waste
and other items into the appropriate recycling containers, I saw a group of
children sit through a lecture on the difficulties of battery recycling only
to return blissfully to their battery-operated toys.
If the game doesn't make the point, you can always recycle the wrapping
paper. A childrens' paper recycling kit is another best seller this
Christmas.

MR John Aspinall, the casino and zoo operator, was ordered to pay Pounds
160,000 costs yesterday after failing to block a casino licence application
by London Clubs International.
A licensing committee at Thames Magistrates Court granted a gaming licence
for London Clubs' Golden Nugget casino, in Soho, in spite of Mr Aspinall's
objection.
Licences for four other casinos, including the Ritz and Les Ambassadeurs,
are likely to be granted on Friday.
The future of London Clubs' six casinos, which account for about 40 per cent
of London's gaming business, has been in doubt since four casinos were
raided by police and Gaming Board officials in June 1991.
This forced the abandonment of the company's stock market flotation,
scheduled for a few days later.
The Gaming Board applied for the cancellation of all six clubs' licences,
alleging serious breaches of gaming laws.
However, after the resignation this year of the chairman, several directors
and senior managers of London Clubs, and the restructuring of the company
and its shareholders, the Gaming Board issued certificates of consent for
six new gaming licences.
Mr John Mathew QC, representing Mr Aspinall's company, Aspinall Clubs, said
the company's past history was relevant to the granting of licences to the
new management. Mr George Carman QC, representing London Clubs, said Mr
Aspinall's objection had been 'irresponsible in the extreme', as no evidence
of the current management's unfitness had been produced.
He said the public might feel that Mr Aspinall's objections were motivated
by his own involvement in the casino business. Mr Aspinall has not yet
decided whether to object to a sixth casino's licence application, which is
due to be heard by a different licensing committee this month.

THE COUNTY BOARD; 


VENTUROPOLY: DOZENS OF LOCAL MERCHANTS BOUGHT GAME SPACE FOR ADVERTISING. SOME 
SAY THEY MADE A GREAT DECISION. OTHERS SAY THEY WASTED THEIR MONEY. 




By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Life in Ventura County has its ups and downs for some people, but it's all just 
a game for others. 


And the name of the game is Venturopoly. For four years, a stylized version of 
the classic board game Monopoly with a local twist has been selling steadily 
throughout Ventura County in bookstores, toy shops and even a hairstyling 
salon. 


The theme of Venturopoly seems to be that the main activities of county 
residents are driving down the Ventura Freeway, selling their farms to shopping 
mall developers, fighting for the environment and getting hit with exorbitant 
parking tickets. 


In the game, there are winners and losers. And in the marketing of the game 
over the last four years, there have also been winners and losers: 


Among the dozens of local merchants who bought board space to advertise their 
products, some say they made a great decision, others that they wasted their 
money on a bad investment. 


"On your way to riches, you'll buy and subdivide large tracts of land, strike 
it rich in the oil fields, or get stung by the schemes of other wily 
speculators," warns an advertisement printed on every box of Venturopoly. 


The words of wisdom are meant for prospective players, but Venturopoly 
investors have found out since the introduction of the game in 1986 that the 
same principle applies in the real world. 


To have its name on one of the game board's 46 spaces, each business paid $700 
to Santa Barbara resident Frank Critchlow, who created and marketed the game. 
In return, they got 36 Venturopoly sets for free. Those who sold out the games 
at the recommended price of $20 a set recovered their investment, but many 
failed to do so. 


Laura Rhodes, owner of Standard Beauty Supply and Salon struck it rich. Her 
shop has sold over 100 games, which are discreetly displayed next to hair 
sprays and brushes and eye shadows. 


"People come in and pick it up because it is so unique and it makes a great 
gift," Rhodes said. "I knew I could market it because women are good shoppers 
and when they come here they're willing to spend money." 


John Holden, president of Century 21 County Center Realty, got stung. "We 
didn't get anything out of it," he said. "Nobody listed their home with us 
because they played Venturopoly, and we ended up giving the games away because 
we couldn't sell them." 


Like Monopoly, which is based on the entrepreneurial spirit embedded in the 
American Dream, the goal of Venturopoly is to become a millionaire, with the 
first player to make $1 million in cash the winner. 


But unlike Monopoly, financial greed in Venturopoly is tempered by concern for 
the environment, the region's history and even a shade of guilt. 


In the world of Venturopoly, the Save the Oaks Society can make you lose a 
turn, cars conk out on the freeway's Conejo Grade overpass, and Chumash Indian 
heads adorn dollar bills. The old family farm gets unscrupulously sold to 
"another shopping mall developer." 


It's a portrait of Ventura County that locals and tourists seem to relate to, 
if game sales are any indication -- more than 3,000 sets sold since 1986. 


For the people who play it, Venturopoly reminds them of what makes their county 
special. "It has to do with our folklore and our heritage," said Saticoy 
Elementary School Principal Nancy Bradford, a Venturopoly enthusiast who has 
sold dozens of games to raise money for her school's PTA. 


The Ojai Music Festival, the Conejo Valley Days and the Ventura County Fair are 
always a roll of the dice away. 


"It's like playing with your neighbors," said Hilda Cooper, who manages the 
Livery bookstore in downtown Ventura, which sells six to eight games a month, 
20 to 30 during the holidays. 


The game board, she said, "is like a shopping directory of Ventura County, and 
you know all the stores." 


In the Monopoly square belonging to, say, Park Place, Venturopoly has Santa 
Paula Savings. In place of Monopoly's Connecticut Avenue is Venturopoly's 
Andria's Seafood restaurant. 


Venturopoly creator Critchlow, 36, is an unlikely entrepreneur. He barely makes 
enough money to split with his brother the $925 rent on a Santa Barbara house. 
The garage has headquartered his one-man toy company, Wizdom Games, since 1984. 


Strange as it may sound, the man who puts millions of play dollars of 
Venturopoly money into every game swears he's perfectly content with his 
$25,000-a-year income and does not intend to get rich. 


"In order to make a huge profit I'd have to go national, and my philosophy is 
to reach a level of survival and not try to expand," Critchlow said. "Here in 
Santa Barbara we like to live within our means." 


Critchlow started out working for a San Francisco-based toy company, where he 
was responsible for designing Monopoly-type games for several cities, including 
Washington, New Orleans and Dallas-Fort Worth. 


"I got excited with the concept and decided to go out on my own," he said. In 
1984, he came out with Santa Barbopoly, featuring Nancy and Ronnie dollar bills 
and the well-known Moreton Bay Fig Tree homeless corner, where players go to 
beg money from their rivals when they become bankrupt. 


More than 6,000 Santa Barbopoly games have been sold so far. "The tourists love 
it, especially the Japanese. They want something from Santa Barbara to take 
home," Critchlow said. 


Critchlow is currently at work designing SLOpoly, the San Luis Obispo version, 
in which the game ends suddenly and nobody wins if a player rolls a double and 
lands on the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, precipitating a "nuclear meltdown." 


He said that SLOpoly will be Wizdom Games' last real estate game. The next 
project involves a "chess-type game with lasers and robots," Critchlow said. 


As for Venturopoly, Critchlow plans to update it once he sells out his first 
batch of 5,000 games. The next version, he promises, will acknowledge the 
re-emergence of the Oxnard Trolley.

PURSUING SUCCESS; 


LAWYER LAUNCHES NEW BOARD GAME BASED ON QUOTES 




By BERNICE HIRABAYASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Whoever first said, "Take a good idea and run with it," must have had George 
Chanos in mind. 


The San Diego lawyer took a leave of absence from his law firm this year to 
promote Notable Quotables, a game he invented that is selling well in San Diego 
stores amid a spattering of media attention. 


"It's being heralded as the next Trivial Pursuit," the enthusiastic 32-year-old 
said. 


The game hit store shelves Nov. 29, just in time for Christmas shoppers. 
Nordstrom and local game stores are reporting strong sales, with Notable 
Quotables rivaling Trivial Pursuit, Scattergories and Taboo in quantities sold, 
games licensed by giants in the hard-to-enter toy industry with a lot of 
advertising dollars behind them. 


"You would expect them to be blowing us out of the water," Chanos said. 


Chanos has sold 4,489 copies of the game to date, and is confident he will sell 
511 more, or the rest of the games manufactured, by January. He said he has 
already met with Parker Brothers and other game companies to discuss a possible 
licensing agreement and is anxiously waiting to introduce the game to the 
nation at the New York Toy Fair in February. 


Notable Quotables challenges players to match provocative quotations with the 
famous people who uttered them. Less celebrity-conscious players can opt to 
fill in a missing word from a quote rather than guess who said it. Answers are 
provided in a 


multiple-choice format, so "you always have something to say and you have a 
33.3% chance of being right," Chanos said. 


There are quotes from Madonna and Charles Manson, from Albert Einstein and 
Leona Helmsley. Chanos' criteria were that the quotes be funny, profound or 
risque. 


"The game mirrors society," he said. "It's the news over the past five years 
condensed in a box." 


But getting the game off the drawing board and into the stores took five years 
of almost obsessive dedication, during which Chanos used his business savvy and 
magnetic personality to sell the idea to everyone from investors to 
manufacturers to the lawyers he worked for. 


 "I began the revolution with 82 men. It does not matter how small you are if 
you have faith and a plan of action."-Fidel Castro 


Chanos first started collecting quotes while attending law school at the 
University of San Diego. He originally planned to publish a book of quotes, but 
during his last year of law school, in 1984, he came across a magazine article 
about Trivial Pursuit, which posted $750 million in sales just one year after 
being introduced. 


"That's a huge, huge amount of money," he said. "You could buy all of Eastern 
Airlines for $500 million." 


The article detailed how the inventors of Trivial Pursuit struggled to get 
people to notice them, persevered and eventually became millionaires. 


Chanos understood how difficult it is to introduce a new game in the toy 
industry, where thousands of new games are invented each year, some by large 
companies and some by individuals like Chanos, only to never be heard of again. 


But he strongly believed in his idea, and decided to minimize his risk by 
researching the game industry, studying why some games fail while others 
succeed. He met with successful game inventors and traveled to the New York Toy 
Fair. 


He started a habit he maintains to this day of reading through a hundred 
publications each week, most of which are unsold throwaways he gets from a 
distributor. Five hundred magazines translates to about 50 quotes he feels are 
appropriate for his game. 


 "If I would believe what I read about myself, I would hate my guts, too."-Zsa 
Zsa Gabor 


In 1989, Chanos developed a prototype version of the game, bartering work from 
designers in exchange for shares in a small company he created called 
GameMakers Ltd., which owns the rights to the game. 


During this time, he became a successful lawyer practicing business litigation 
and transactional work for San Diego's Lorenz Alhadeff Lundin &amp; Oggel. But, 
during his third year there, he decided to step off the partnership track and 
work on Notable Quotables full time. 


The law firm was sold on the idea also, offering Chanos a job if things didn't 
work out, and drawing up an investment package in exchange for a stake in 
GameMakers. 


By 1990, Chanos had raised $400,000 from investors, who included fellow 
lawyers, former clients, Alex Spanos, the owner of the San Diego Chargers, Mary 
Papas, the owner of Athens Market, and others. 


Many were won over more by Chanos than his idea. 


"I invested in the person," said Donald Cohn, president of DataQuick, a San 
Diego-based on-line information service. "I invested in George." 


Cohn said he usually goes for more traditional investments, but was so 
impressed with Chanos' thoroughness, which included market studies, that he 
simply felt it was a worth the risk. 


 "After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The 
game is what counts."-Aristotle Onassis 


The stores Chanos approached with his game are also glad they decided to 
believe in him. 


"It's done better than I had anticipated," said David Lyon, a buyer for the 
four Nordstrom department stores in San Diego County. Lyon said he looks for a 
unique game each holiday season for the men's department, and this year he 
chose Notable Quotables. 


Sales of the game, which retails for $39.95, accounted for a major percentage 
of total sales for the department, especially on weekends when Chanos 
demonstrates the game to passing customers, Lyon said. 


"I don't have another single item, except socks and belts, that sells more than 
this," he said. 


Chanos believes the game is popular because people are fascinated by the famous 
and what they have to say. 


"There are a lot of people in the country that like quotations," he said. 


"Also, the timing is perfect. People played Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary. 
They got used to a big new game every three to four years. I think people are 
waiting for this." 


And what is Chanos' favorite quote? 


"Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever hope to achieve greatly." Robert 
F. Kennedy.
