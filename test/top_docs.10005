IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 


BLOOD DEFECT LINK TO PARKINSON'S 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




Scientists say they have detected a blood cell defect in people with 
Parkinson's disease, a link that could help identify victims before symptoms 
appear. Such timely identification, they say, could open the door for earlier 
treatment of the disease that afflicts 400,000 Americans. 


The findings, published in the Annals of Neurology, are the product of 
federally funded research at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. 


Parkinson's is a neurological condition characterized by gradually worsening 
tremors, muscle rigidity and weakness -- symptoms blamed on the disappearance 
of key brain cells. 


The scientists reported finding what appears to be an enzyme deficiency inside 
blood cells of Parkinson's patients, suggesting the disease affects more than 
just the brain cells it kills.

FUNGUS MAY BE A CAUSE OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE; 


HEALTH: TWO RESEARCHERS SAY PROOF WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT COULD CONSTITUTE 'A 
MAJOR DISCOVERY.' 




By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 




At least some cases of Parkinson's disease, a devastating neurological illness 
that affects as many as 500,000 Americans, may be caused by infection by a 
common soil fungus, researchers from UC Davis will report today. 


Infection of laboratory animals with the fungus, called Nocardia asteroides, 
damages the specific areas of the brain involved in Parkinson's disease and 
produces symptoms identical to those found in human patients, the researchers 
will tell a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Anaheim. 


"It's not going to be easy to prove this (that Nocardia causes Parkinson's in 
humans), and there are going to be large numbers of skeptics," said 
microbiologist Blaine L. Beaman of UC Davis. "It certainly seems unbelievable, 
but if we can prove it, it translates into a major discovery." 


Pinpointing a cause of Parkinson's would be of tremendous significance because 
scientists currently do not know what causes the disease. Furthermore, 
identifying a cause, particularly an infectious agent, should lead to new ways 
of preventing the disease, such as immunization against the microorganism. 


Nocardia is widespread in the environment and most people are probably 
routinely exposed to it, either in the air or through cuts. It normally causes 
transient flu-like symptoms, such as cough and fever, but it has been observed 
to cause neurological symptoms in humans, and in some susceptible individuals 
may actually trigger Parkinson's, according to Beaman. 


Other Parkinson's researchers were cautious in their assessment of the 
scientists' results, primarily because no one had seen the study. But "their 
finding is intriguing," said neuroscientist Debra Mash of the National 
Parkinson's Foundation. "It fits in with what we already know. There are a lot 
of things that cause Parkinson's, and most of us agree that it is something in 
the environment." 


"That's an astounding assertion," said neurologist J. William Langston of the 
California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose, who himself discovered that a 
contaminant formed in the production of the street drug methamphetamine can 
cause Parkinson's. "It would be absolutely fascinating if it is proved to have 
some basis." 


Parkinson's disease primarily affects people over 55. Its main symptoms are 
incapacitating tremors and rigidity of the limbs. As many as 30% of the victims 
also suffer dementia, a form of mental impairment. 


The disorder results from the death of brain cells that produce the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, a brain hormone that is particularly important in 
the control of muscle movement. Symptoms can be alleviated, at least in the 
early stages, with the drug L-dopa, which is converted into dopamine in the 
brain. 


Physicians are also experimenting with transplanting dopamine-secreting cells 
into the brains of Parkinson's victims, but those results, while promising, are 
still considered inconclusive. 


Researchers have never been able to identify the cause of Parkinson's, however, 
and that mystery is a source of considerable study. Their best lead in the past 
was Langston's discovery that a chemical called MPTP, which contaminates some 
batches of illicit methamphetamine, causes a Parkinson's-like disease in young 
people who use the drug. 


At least 400 cases of Parkinson's disease caused by MPTP are known, and 
researchers routinely use the chemical to induce Parkinson's in experimental 
animals. Many researchers believe that environmental chemicals with a structure 
similar to MPTP may cause the disease. 


Some pesticides, for example, have similar structures. But no one has ever been 
able to prove the association. 


A report to Congress by the Office of Technology Assessment on Wednesday, in 
fact, argued that the government is not doing enough to control the release 
into the environment of chemicals that may have the potential to cause both 
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The report called for an additional $1.5 
million for study of the neurotoxic effects of such chemicals. 


Although many researchers have suggested that infections might also be a cause 
of Parkinson's, most researchers discount that possibility because of a lack of 
supporting evidence. No one has ever been able to isolate an infectious agent, 
such as a virus or bacterium, from the brain of a Parkinson's victim, and no 
one has observed any residual traces of the inflammation that would be expected 
to accompany an infection. 


But Beaman and his colleague, microbiologist Shunro Kohbata, who is on 
sabbatical at Davis from Gifu University in Japan, believe they have found an 
explanation for the lack of such evidence. "Nocardia does unique things that 
other bacteria do not do," Beaman said. 


When Beaman and Kohbata infused large quantities of Nocardia into the blood of 
research animals, the animals suffered widespread inflammation and the few that 
survived showed a variety of neurological symptoms. 


But when they infused much smaller doses, they found that the microorganism 
infected the brain without any inflammatory response -- not surprising because 
immune cells cannot enter the brain unless there is a breach of the blood-brain 
barrier that shields the brain from potentially toxic chemicals in blood. 


In the brain, the Nocardia infection was self-limiting, Beaman said, and it was 
cleared within two weeks. Only after all traces of the infection were gone did 
the neurological symptoms develop. "If we didn't follow the course of events 
carefully, we would never be able to detect the organism," he said. 


According to Beaman, about 15% of the several hundred animals studied in his 
experiments developed symptoms that included rigidity on one side of the body 
(hemiparesis) and head shaking. These symptoms were alleviated with L-dopa. 
Langston cautioned, however, that hemiparesis is not one of the major symptoms 
of Parkinson's, which "raises some doubts" about their discovery. 


Although Nocardia seems to produce no major health effects in most people, it 
causes a much more serious infection in people whose immune systems are 
suppressed, such as by AIDS, organ transplants or cancer. In those patients, it 
can cause serious brain damage or be lethal. 


As support for their theory, Beaman and Kohbata noted that many people with 
severe Nocardia infections have been seen to develop a variety of neurological 
symptoms, including those of Parkinson's disease. Even less serious Nocardia 
infections might trigger such symptoms in genetically susceptible people, they 
speculated. 


Beaman plans to begin looking for traces of Nocardia infection, such as 
antibodies against it, in Parkinson's victims, but he acknowledges that a long 
road lies ahead. 


"There may be many etiologies for Parkinson's. There probably are. Nocardia may 
be one of them, but it will require a lot of work to find out."

NEW GENETIC GRAFT EASES SYMPTOMS IN RATS 




UC San Diego researchers report that they can alleviate the symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease in rats by grafting genetically engineered skin cells into 
the animals' brains. 


Their technique may drastically reduce some of the ethical difficulties 
associated with a controversial new therapy for the disease that involves 
grafting brain cells from aborted fetuses into the brains of Parkinson's 
victims. 


Parkinson's is caused by the death of brain cells that secrete the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays a key role in the control of muscle 
movements. 


In an effort to replace the lost dopamine, surgeons have grafted both tissue 
from the adrenal glands, which also secrete dopamine, and brain tissue from 
aborted fetuses into the brains of about 300 Parkinson's victims. 


But grafting adrenal tissue requires two operations -- one to remove the tissue 
from its normal location over the kidney and one to implant it -- and the use 
of fetal tissue has become inextricably entwined with the debate over abortion. 
Federal rules now prevent the use of fetal tissue in government-funded research 
or therapy. 


Neuroscientist Fred H. Gage and his colleagues at UCSD have circumvented these 
problems by genetically altering rat skin cells so that they secrete dopamine, 
then implanting the cells into the brains of rats in which dopamine-secreting 
brain cells had been destroyed. Because the cells were destroyed on only one 
side of the brain, the rats' muscle control was impaired on one side of their 
body and they walked in circles. 


Gage and his colleagues reported in the latest Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences that the genetically engineered cells reduced the 
Parkinson-like symptoms by 40%. The altered cells are "nowhere near as 
effective as fetal cells," Gage said, but he believes that their efficacy can 
be greatly improved. Most important, he added, the approach offers a "viable 
alternative" to the use of fetal cells.

DRUG IS FOUND TO DELAY PROGRESSION OF PARKINSON'S 




By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 




Scientists have demonstrated for the first time that a drug treatment can delay 
the brain-destroying progression of Parkinson's disease. 


In a California trial involving 54 patients, the drug, called deprenyl, nearly 
doubled the time that elapsed between the onset of Parkinson's and the need for 
therapy with the most commonly used drug, L-dopa, researchers from the 
California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose report in today's issue of the 
journal Science. 


L-dopa does not slow the normally fatal disease, which usually strikes people 
over the age of 50, but it does alleviate its symptoms, which include disabling 
tremors and rigidity of the limbs and, in at least 30% of the cases, mental 
impairment. 


Combined with earlier anecdotal reports suggesting that deprenyl prolongs the 
lives of Parkinson's victims, the research suggests that powerful relief will 
soon be available for Parkinson's victims, who number over 1 million in the 
United States alone. Deprenyl is scheduled to be marketed as a prescription 
drug next month. 


But the discovery has implications even beyond that. Two other conditions 
associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(Lou Gehrig's disease), also involve inexorable degeneration of brain cells, 
and physicians have not been able to slow their progression either. 


The fact that disease progression has been slowed in Parkinson's "raises the 
hope that you can do it with the others as well," said neurologist J. William 
Langston, the principal investigator of the new study. 


The new results are "very important," said neurologist Stanley Fahn of the 
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, co-chairman of a larger 
study of deprenyl -- called DATATOP -- that is now under way at 28 clinical 
centers throughout the country. 


Langston's study served as a pilot program for DATATOP. Results from the larger 
study are not expected until late 1990 at the earliest, and Fahn refused to 
comment on them. But rumors circulating in the neurological community suggest 
that those results will support Langston's findings. 


And Langston's results could have an immediate impact on treatment of 
Parkinson's in this country. Six weeks ago, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approved marketing of deprenyl for use in combination with 
L-dopa for treating patients late in the course of Parkinson's. Somerset 
Pharmaceuticals of Denville, N.J., will begin marketing the drug as Eldepryl in 
mid-September, and once they do, physicians -- as they may with any drug -- 
will be free to prescribe it for any use they see fit. 


Fahn noted that it is "inevitable" that large numbers of neurologists will 
"jump on it (deprenyl)" for their patients in the early stages of the disease. 


Parkinson's disease results from the death of cells in the substantia nigra 
portion of the brain that secrete the neural transmitter dopamine, which plays 
a key role in the control of muscle movement. The disease's cause is unknown, 
but growing numbers of neurologists believe that it is produced by chemicals in 
the environment that poison the dopamine-secreting cells. 


As production of dopamine is slowed, the victims lose control of their limbs 
until they eventually become completely disabled. L-dopa is used in therapy 
because it is converted into dopamine in the brain, increasing the brain's 
dopamine supply. But it is effective, on average, for only about six years, 
after which symptoms worsen. 


Some researchers have attempted to cure Parkinson's by transplanting 
dopamine-secreting cells from the adrenal glands or from fetuses into the 
brains of victims. But those procedures have been attempted on only about 300 
patients and there is still no consensus on their value. 


In contrast, deprenyl could be used with virtually every Parkinson's patient. 


For their study, Langston and neurologist James W. Tetrud recruited 54 patients 
who had recently been found to have Parkinson's disease. Half were given 
twice-daily doses of deprenyl and half were given a placebo -- a sugar pill 
with no effect. The patients were monitored until either they had been in the 
study for three years or their condition became severe enough to require 
L-dopa. 


They found that the average time before L-dopa was required was 312 days in the 
placebo group and 549 days in the deprenyl group. 


Langston and Tetrud also rated the patients' neurological condition on five 
separate scales. They found that, based on these scales, disease progression 
was slowed by 40% to 83% per year. 


"The clinical observations suggest that the disease is progressing more slowly 
. . . and that's compelling evidence, but it is not proof," Langston said in an 
interview. "To prove it, we would have to demonstrate that nerve cells are 
surviving over time, (a procedure) that is not currently possible in living 
humans." 


At the end of the study, the patients were taken off deprenyl for a month to 
ensure that the apparent slowdown in disease progression was due to the 
preservation of nerve cells and not simply to relief of symptoms. The drug 
therapy was then restarted and the researchers will continue to monitor the 
patients to determine whether the drug continues its effects for longer 
periods. 


Ironically, deprenyl has been used in Europe for about 15 years to treat 
patients who have begun to develop tolerance for the effects of L-dopa. In one 
key study, pharmacologist Moussa B.H. Youdim of the Technion-Israel Institute 
of Technology found that combined use of L-dopa and deprenyl substantially 
increased the survival of Parkinson's victims. 


But that study was viewed with "a great deal of skepticism," according to UCLA 
neurologist Charles H. Markham, because it was an uncontrolled study on an 
unusual group of Parkinson's patients. Langston's results, however, would seem 
to provide strong support for Youdim's conclusions. 


The $10-million DATATOP study has a design similar to Langston and Tetrud's but 
involves 800 patients. Some of those patients are also receiving Vitamin E as 
well as deprenyl, however, to determine whether Vitamin E can also slow the 
disease, as animal experiments have suggested. 


If the DATATOP results confirm Langston and Tetrud's, Fahn said, researchers 
will almost certainly begin studying the long-term combined effects of L-dopa 
and deprenyl to determine if people will in fact live longer. 




PARKINSON'S DRUG 


Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of cells in the substantia nigra at 
the base of the brain that release a hormone necessary for controlling muscle 
movements. Mounting evidence indicates that metabolites of environmental 
chemicals, such as pesticides, can kill the cells, causing the disease. The 
drug deprenyl delays the progression of Parkinson's by blocking conversion of 
the chemicals into their toxic form.

NERVE CELLS from a patient's intestine may soon be transplanted to cure
brain disease, the British Association meeting at Keele heard yesterday.
Animal studies at University College, London, show that nerve cells
transplanted from a rat's gut into its brain grow into the surrounding
tissue, while at the same time nerves from the brain penetrate the
transplant.
Some of the animals had brain damage which would be a good model for human
degenerative disorders, notably Huntington's Chorea and Parkinson's disease.
Professor Geoffrey Burnstock, head of anatomy and developmental biology at
UCL, says gut-to-brain transplants would avoid many problems posed by foetal
transplants - where cells have been transplanted from human foetuses into
the brains of Parkinson's sufferers as a means of 'rewiring' damaged nerves.
More than 100,000 people in the UK suffer from Parkinson's.
Dr Peter Jenner of the Parkinson's Disease Experimental Research
Laboratories at King's College, London, described the findings as 'very
exciting'. The foetal technique had been over-hyped and produced false
hopes, because the foetal cells had not grown well enough, he said. The best
results were on patients in Sweden but none had recovered sufficiently to
stop taking drugs.
Most of the chemical messengers which control brain activity are present in
the gut cells. There would be no possibility of the transplant being
rejected by the patient's immune system, because it came from his or her own
intestines. And the ethical objections to using foetal cells would not
exist.
The next stage in Prof Burnstock's research will be to discover what it is
about the gut transplant that triggers nerves in the brain to start growing.
Usually damage to the brain is permanent because nerves do not grow back. If
the factors responsible are isolated, they could be used to treat spinal
injuries and other nerve damage.
The UCL research also opens up the possibility of curing inherited brain
disease. Gut-to-brain transplants could be used to deliver correct copies of
faulty genes.
Prof Burnstock said the nervous system of the gut was sometimes known as a
'small brain' because it could sustain so many sophisticated reflex
activities independently of the central nervous system. More than 60 of the
transmitter chemicals it uses were also produced in the brain.
It is not clear how soon the research could be applied to humans. Further
animal studies are needed to find out how selective a transplant's effect is
and how its growth is controlled.

RELATIONSHIPS: UNDERSTANDING DEMENTIA 




By Researched by: APRIL D. JACKSON / Los Angeles Times 




Although Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, there are more than 
70 others. Dementia may be triggered by strokes, high blood pressure, 
alcoholism, medications, brain tumors and infections, depression and rare 
diseases that cause brain damage, including Pick's, Huntington's and 
Parkinson's. 


ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 


The disease most closely associated with aging, Alzheimer's causes the 
progressive deterioration of the brain to such an extent as to render victims 
unable to recognize their spouses and immediate family. The patient may become 
confused, unable to concentrate and have trouble finishing sentences. More than 
70% of the patients had behavioral disorders, such as unprovoked 
aggressiveness. Over time, Alzheimer's leaves victims as helpless (and just as 
needing) as children. 


No treatment is available to stop or reverse its degenerative effects. 


MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA 


Multi-infarct dementia, or vascular dementia, is caused by multiple strokes 
(infarcts) in the brain. Because the strokes usually occur before the symptoms 
of dementia appear, the onset of the dementia seems sudden. The strokes affect 
the part of the brain responsible for specific functions, such as calculations, 
and create the more generalized symptoms of disorientation and behavioral 
changes. Because of multi-infarct dementia's similarity to Alzheimer's, the two 
coexist in 15% to 20% of dementia patients. 


No cure or reversing process exists, but early assessment of cause can halt the 
progression of the disease. 


PARKINSON'S DISEASE 


Those with Parkinson's lack dopamine in their systems. This neurotransmitter 
helps control the tremor, stiffness and slowness characteristic of the disease. 
In late stages, some patients develop dementia. Parkinson's patients often 
develop Alzheimer's and, at times, Alzheimer's patients develop Parkinson's 
symptoms. 


Drugs can treat the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's but do not 
improve any mental deterioration. Parkinson's is considered a model for drug 
research on Alzheimer's disease. 




Dollars and Financial Impact 


Fewer research dollars go toward studying Alzheimer's disease, and other 
dementing illnesses, than heart disease, cancer or AIDS. Yet, Alzheimer's, the 
fourth-leading cause of death among adults in the country, claims more than 
100,000 lives annually. 


An estimated 4 million seniors suffer from the disease nationally, while Orange 
County has 40,000 Alzheimer's victims who struggle to cope with the 
mysteriously debilitating brain disorder. 


There is no known reason why the disease strikes people over the age of 60, and 
there is no known cure for this ultimately fatal disease. Further, total costs, 
which include diagnosis, treatment, long-term care and lost wages, is estimated 
to be more than $88 billion each year. 


The federal government covers $4.4 billion of these costs and state coffers are 
dipped into for another $4.1 billion. But the remaining $79 billion is borne by 
Alzheimer's patients and their families.

Differences Between AAMI and Alzheimer's Disease 


The term age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) refers to the minor memory 
difficulties that come with age, or are often brought on by stress. AAMI 
differs from Alzheimer's disease, and other related dementias, in that AAMI is 
neither debilitating nor progressive. 


Commonly thought of as "forgetfulness," AAMI can be brought on by grief, 
depression, illness, stress, medication, alcohol, fatigue, lack of 
concentration or just attempting to remember too many details at once.

Alzheimer's Disease 


Alzheimer's disease, often mistakenly thought to be the definition of dementia, 
is the most commonly known of the 60 possible causes of senile dementia. 


Declines in intellectual functions and in the ability to perform routine 
activities often renders dementia victims virtually without memory, as 
dependent as infants on the support of others to feed, clothe and bathe 
themselves. A steady loss of brain cells intensifies the symptoms of 
deteriorating memory, impaired judgment, depression, a lack of concentration 
and restlessness. 


In 1989, people 75 years and older ran the greatest risk of falling victim to 
the debilitating and often incurable symptoms of senile dementia. And, within 
the next 50 years, as the nation's senior population grows, the number of 
dementia patients is expected to triple. 


At what age are you most likely to fall victim to dementia?

What Is Dementia? 


Dementia is a term applied to a group of progressively debilitating symptoms, 
including the inability to learn or remember information, repetitive behavior, 
inarticulateness and personality and behavioral changes. 


Even at advanced ages, memory loss that interferes with everyday life is not 
normal. Any person exhibiting an increased inability to think or reason should 
contact one of the local assessment centers in Orange County or consult a 
neurologist to determine the cause of the dementia. 


Progression rates of dementia vary, and depending on the condition causing the 
brain cells to deteriorate, often the symptoms can be minimized to slow 
progress of the disease. 


FACTS ABOUT DEMENTIA YOU SHOULD KNOW: 


* Nearly 20% of the causes of dementia can be corrected. Thyroid imbalances, 
brain tumors, drug intoxication, alcoholism and infections are just a few of 
the many treatable, and reversible, causes of dementia. 


* Alzheimer's disease is not a generic term for forgetfulness. Rather, 
Alzheimer's is the most common form of the progressive, degenerative and, 
ultimately, fatal diseases that produce dementia. Parkinson's disease, 
multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and multiple 
sclerosis are other well-known diseases whose link to dementia are 
irreversible. 


* Early signs of dementia include memory problems, depression, anxiety and an 
inability to concentrate long enough to read or follow the plot of television 
shows. 


* In Orange County, there are more than 40,000 victims of Alzheimer's disease. 
Nationally, an estimated 4 million seniors are affected by the disease. By the 
year 2040, the total number of Alzheimer's disease victims is expected to 
triple. 


* Over 50% of all nursing home patients suffer from dementia-related disorders. 
The annual cost of nursing facility care ranges from $24,000 to $36,000. 


* An estimated 70% of all Alzheimer's victims are cared for at home, by their 
families. Annual costs of home care are approximately $18,000. 


* Congress is considering increasing the amount in federal spending allotted 
for Alzheimer's disease research to $132 million in fiscal year 1990, an 
increase that would average out to a little more than $50 per patient. By 
comparison, the National Institutes of Health invests 10 times that amount for 
research on cancer, heart disease and AIDS. 


* In the case of Alzheimer's, there is no cure and the cause of the disease is 
not known.

SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 


U.S. BAN ON USING FETAL TISSUE DOESN'T STOP RESEARCH; 


HEALTH: NOVEL EXPERIMENTS IN ANIMALS STIR EXCITEMENT AMONG SCIENTISTS. 




By RICK WEISS, Weiss is life science/biomedicine editor of Science News 
magazine in Washington, from which this article is adapted. 




The timing was ironic. As 12,000 researchers gathered recently at the Society 
for Neuroscience's annual meeting, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan extended indefinitely a ban on federally funded fetal tissue 
transplants. 


The moratorium, which predominantly affects neuroscientists, forbids federal 
support for experimental transplants into humans of tissue from intentionally 
aborted fetuses. Continuing a ban initiated in March, 1988, by the Reagan 
Administration, it does not apply to transplants of animal fetal cells. 


Sullivan, rejecting the conclusions of a National Institutes of Health advisory 
committee convened last year, decided that "permitting the human fetal research 
at issue will increase the incidence of abortion across the country." 


Though the extended ban has angered many neuroscientists, researchers at the 
conference shared a wealth of data from novel experiments in animals -- many 
involving transplants of nonfetal nerve cells that may some day find 
application in humans. While most neuroscientists doubt nonfetal cells will 
ever match the therapeutic potential of fetal cells, this work stirs excitement 
among many researchers. 


But whatever the potential of nonfetal substitutes, fetal cells remain 
neuroscientists' tissue of choice. Some experiments indicate fetal tissue may 
prove valuable in treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and other 
neurodegenerative conditions. For example, the first U.S. patient to receive 
such a transplant -- a 52-year-old man with a 20-year history of Parkinson's 
disease -- has responded to his surgery with significant improvements in 
mobility, reports Curt R. Freed of the University of Colorado School of 
Medicine in Denver, who performed the surgery with private funds in November, 
1988. 


The federal ban undoubtedly will minimize the number of such surgeries in the 
near future, further delaying any conclusions about the procedure's 
effectiveness in humans, Freed said. Moreover, the few privately funded U.S. 
researchers continuing to experiment with human fetal cell transplants complain 
bitterly about being relegated to the status of scientific renegades. 


But economic and political problems are not the only factors prompting 
neuroscientists to seek alternatives to human fetal cells. "The (funding) 
problems have in part stimulated people to look for alternatives, but this 
would have evolved even if there hadn't been a ban on fetal tissues," said Fred 
H. Gage of UC San Diego. "We're expanding our horizons; we're looking for 
options." 


Gage and his colleagues recently demonstrated that nonfetal cells do show some 
promise. Recently, they reported that they had successfully transplanted 
genetically engineered rat-skin cells called fibroblasts into the brains of 
rats with a syndrome resembling Parkinson's disease. Engineered to secrete the 
brain chemical dopamine, which has been found in short supply in Parkinson's 
patients, the cells alleviated the rats' symptoms by an average of 35% and may 
hold potential as a treatment for Parkinson's, said Gage and others. These 
experiments were described in the November proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences. 


Researchers elsewhere are experimenting with other nonfetal cells -- some 
gene-altered and some not -- with equally intriguing preliminary results. For 
example, many presentations at this year's neuroscience meeting focused on 
transplants of fibroblasts genetically engineered to produce substances such as 
nerve growth factor, a protein that stimulates nerve regeneration. These cells, 
when implanted into the brains of rats suffering from nerve damage, stimulate 
neuronal repair. 


Other researchers have transplanted young astrocytes -- star-shaped, central 
nervous system cells -- from donor rats onto injured spinal cord tissue in 
recipient rats. Astrocytes belong to a class called glial cells, which provide 
physical and biochemical support for neurons. Reports at the neuroscience 
meeting indicate that transplanted astrocytes and other types of glial cells 
appear to improve coordination in the injured rats by stimulating the 
production of nerve-nurturing substances around the injury and by preventing 
scarring there. Tiny scars can block regenerating neurons from renewing 
connections with surviving nerve endings. 


"It's become a very hot area to look for cells that secrete factors that may 
facilitate repair," Timothy J. Collier of the University of Rochester (N.Y.) 
School of Medicine and Dentistry said. "Everyone's very interested in glial 
cells, which seem to make damaged cells happier." 


Researchers have begun genetically engineering glial cells in attempts to 
enhance their therapeutic potential. However, Freed said, "it will be some time 
before we become as comfortable with custom-made cells as we are with fetal 
cells, which we understand much better." 


Moreover, scientists have yet to demonstrate that engineered cells can perform 
all the functions of their fetal counterparts. "I absolutely support 
(engineered) cell-line research to come up with improved transplant material," 
said D. Eugene Redmond, director of the neurobehavior laboratory at Yale 
University. "But the probability of taking something like a fibroblast and 
engineering into it all the factors necessary for neuronal function and 
communication so it knows who to talk to, when to release its transmitter. This 
may involve a thousand things." 


Added Gage: "It certainly is clear that fetal neuronal transplants are more 
effective than any of the other cell types at present." 


Indeed, fetal cells today seem awash in scientific praise. "Their ability to 
survive and multiply necessitates the grafting of only small numbers of cells . 
. . and they are adaptable to the host environment," wrote University of 
Rochester neurobiologists John T. Hansen and John R. Sladek in a review article 
in the journal Science. "The benefits of studying fetal cells are many, and the 
clinical potential for their use as therapeutic tools is just now being 
realized." 


In contrast, Redmond noted, gene-altered fibroblasts and other engineered cells 
"are going to be extremely suspect" because of their potential to divide 
uncontrollably, like cancerous tumors. "Some of these alternatives are going to 
have extreme liabilities." 


At this point, Gage said, no one really knows whether fetal cells can live up 
to their exalted promise. Ban or no ban, he thinks researchers need to conduct 
more fetal cell transplants into animals -- a procedure allowed under the 
moratorium -- before embarking on widespread human trials. 


But until the fetal cell transplants into humans can proceed unimpeded, their 
value will remain an open question, Gage and others say. And the decision on 
whether to go ahead with such trials should be based upon scientific rationale, 
they insist. 


"None of the reasons for the ban had anything to do with bad science or good 
science or whether or not it's reasonable to pursue this work on scientific 
grounds," Gage said. "I can't believe that patients with degenerative diseases 
are not up in arms. It doesn't seem real. But, then, I'm a scientist."

PERSPECTIVE ON MEDICINE; 


WE WHO FACE THIS NIGHTMARE SEE FETAL RESEARCH IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT; 


THERE IS NO LOGIC AND MUCH AGONY IN BANNING USE OF ABORTED TISSUE FOR RESEARCH 
ON PARKINSON'S AND OTHER DISEASES. 




By JOAN SAMUELSON CORBETT, Joan Samuelson Corbett is a lawyer who lives in 
Sonoma County. 




A fight begins on Capitol Hill this week over an issue that, to some, simply 
offers the latest chance to restage America's familiar moral dialogue over 
abortion. But to me -- and to several million other Americans -- it involves a 
matter of personal survival. 


After decades of research, teams in Sweden and Denver have announced the first 
successful transplants of fetal brain tissue to victims of Parkinson's disease, 
a degenerative neurological disorder. The implanted cells are thriving in the 
ailing part of the afflicted person's brain and producing a crucial 
neurochemical that the stricken brain cells had stopped supplying. 


Researchers caution that this is not yet a reliable therapy, much less a cure. 
But for those of us facing the nightmare of advanced Parkinsonism -- a lethal 
blend of rigidity, tremor and motor dysfunction, eventually robbing the ability 
to walk, eat, talk, even move -- this development is a dream come true. 


And more good news will follow: Fetal tissue transplants appear to be reversing 
diabetes symptoms, and may be a possible therapy for many other chronic 
degenerative conditions. In the United States, though, this work is a political 
hostage of abortion politics. Last November, the Bush Administration extended a 
Reagan-era moratorium on federal financing of fetal tissue research because 
ituses the remains of elective abortions. Since researchers on medical 
frontiers depend heavily on government assistance, major breakthroughs that 
scientists expected are blocked by lack of funds. The Denver project subsists 
on a bequest from a philanthropist and on the fees it charges those 
volunteering as transplant candidates. 


Some members of Congress are seeking to lift the ban legislatively, through the 
Research Freedom Act, sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). The bill, 
which would free such funding from political intervention, faces its first vote 
this month. And when it does, a congressional "pro-life" force is expected to 
attempt to reduce the discussion to the anti-abortion rhetoric that was used to 
justify the presidential moratorium. 


President Bush's staff described his decision as a "matter of heart and of 
mind." For me, it is a matter of life. 


Under the current system of regulation, American women have more than 1 million 
legal abortions each year. Since opinion polls show support for the continued 
availability of that right, we can expect that abortion will continue to be 
legal in some states (if not all) and many abortions will be performed in 
future years. Yet the President refuses to allow fetal tissue, which otherwise 
is destroyed, to save lives. Where is the logic in that? 


As for the "heart" behind the ban: I just hope members of Congress take time, 
before voting, to have their hearts touched by those of us in need of a 
scientific miracle. 


If they sit down with my parents or my husband, for example, they will know the 
chill my loved ones feel as they think about my future. There are drugs on the 
market that temporarily reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's, and a new drug may 
even retard it -- but they are only a medical finger in the dike. Eventually 
Parkinson's surges forward, leaving advancing dysfunction and death in its 
wake. 


For me, that -- never mind my career, or my new marriage or my dreams of having 
children -- is the future. The millions of other Americans afflicted with 
Parkinson's, diabetes and the other diseases have their own stories of 
unrealized dreams; of watching their bodies fail them, and being unable to do 
anything to stop it. 


Maybe the President feels morally entitled to close his heart to us. Since 
abortion is wrong, he reasons, no benefit should result, even if it would save 
a life. But punishing me for another's moral choice -- a choice that will be 
made anyway -- doesn't even out the equation. It just harms more people. 


The Swedes don't mix the issues. They regulate abortions, and then allow the 
remains to be used to help people. 


And consider the French: They have just announced successful use of fetal 
tissue transplants to living fetuses still in the womb that treated those tiny 
new lives for inherited diseases before their birth. 


Shouldn't we encourage such miracles? How can it be "pro-life" to stop them? 
Those are questions my family and I have for the members of Congress. And there 
is one more. 


Someday, the work of the Swedes, the French and underfunded U.S. researchers 
will reach and help Americans. At the current pace of research, that "someday" 
may be far away. In the meantime, the disease will continue its quiet violence. 
So I wonder, will this plodding rescue effort reach me in time?

   By CLIVE COOKSON


The drugs industry's view of Alzheimer's disease has been transformed during
the past two decades, from an obscure and untreatable form of dementia to a
favourite target for research. Alzheimer's disease probably causes more
human distress, for victims and their friends and families, than any other
single disease of modern industrial society. It is now known to cause 70 per
cent of all cases of dementia, turning healthy brain cells irreversibly into
a characteristic pattern of decaying tangles and sticky plaques of protein.
At least 10m people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease.
The symptoms include progressive memory loss, inability to carry out simple
everyday tasks, breakdown of personality and, after a few years, death.
Alice Zilonka, aged 73, memorably described the early stage to the UK
Alzheimer's Disease Society: 'My brain is like a dark thunderstorm.'
Unfortunately there is no prospect of lightening her personal darkness. But
there is now a glimmer of scientific optimism about Alzheimer's. Researchers
have begun to understand the biological basis of the disease, in particular
the microscopic 'senile plaques' and 'neurofibrilary tangles' that are the
main sign of deterioration in sufferers' brains at post-mortem examinations.
The plaques result from the aggregation of 'beta-amyloid protein' molecules
around the decaying nerve terminals of brain cells. These molecules are
fragments of a much larger parent protein, known as amyloid precursor
protein (APP). Healthy cells produce small quantities of APP (though its
normal function is unknown) but in excess it may lead to toxic accumulations
of beta-amyloid.
Several different factors can trigger the Alzheimer's process. Researchers
at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London have recently discovered that
some rare inherited forms of the disease are due to mutations in the gene on
chromosome 21 which determines the structure of APP.
But inherited genetic defects probably account for only 10 to 15 per cent of
Alzheimer's cases. Many more are caused by environmental factors triggering
excessive APP production in injured nerve cells. One possible factor that
used to be the subject of much interest - but is now rather discredited - is
intake of aluminium. There is more evidence linking severe head injury to
the development of Alzheimer's. Viruses may also be involved. But most of
the risk factors are unknown. Clues may come from epidemiological studies
which show that Alzheimer's is extremely rare among old people in tropical
Africa but common in Afro-Americans who have grown up in the US.
Reports of the recent advances in Alzheimer's research - fuelled in the US
by enthusiastic press releases from young biotechnology companies working on
drugs for dementia - have aroused what many experts believe is an
unrealistic public expectation that there will soon be an effective
treatment for the disease.
'I can't see anything within 10 years that is really going to make an impact
on Alzheimer's,' says Geoffrey Dunbar, director of SmithKline Beecham's
central nervous system therapeutic unit. 'Yes, there's a lot of interest in
APP but we're a long way away (from an actual drug) even in that area.'
Michael Traub, director of clinical neuroscience at Merck's UK laboratory,
looks even further ahead. 'Someone might come up with a fundamental
understanding of Alzheimer's disease within the next 20 years but that
doesn't mean there'll be a drug in 20 years,' he says.
The types of treatment now undergoing clinical trials can do no more than
relieve temporarily some of the symptoms, particularly memory loss. The most
popular approach is to improve the function of neurotransmitters, the
chemical switches by which cells pass messages. The main target is
acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter essential for memory) in which the
Alzheimer's brain is severely deficient.
A class of medicines called aminoacridines achieve this by blocking the
enzyme that destroys acetylcholine in the brain. Two such drugs, velnacrine
(Mentane) from Hoechst of Germany and tacrine (Cognex) from Warner-Lambert
of the US, are awaiting approval from regulatory authorities on both sides
of the Atlantic.
Several more are at an earlier stage of development. But they are
controversial because they only work in a minority of patients - improving
memory slightly for a year or two - and they can cause side-effects such as
liver damage.
In addition, several existing drugs that help other disorders of the nervous
system are being tested for their effect on Alzheimer's. An example is
selegiline (Eldepryl) from Sandoz of Switzerland, which slows the
progression of Parkinson's disease by reducing the damage done to brain
cells by oxygen-free radicals.
However 'the holy grail of Alzheimer's research must be to prevent
beta-amyloid deposition,' says Jim Edwardson, director of the MRC
Neurochemical Pathology Unit in Newcastle upon Tyne. 'Many pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies are investing considerable money and skill,
trying to develop drugs that would prevent amyloid deposition.'
Several companies are concentrating on the enzymes involved in amyloid
metabolism, seeking a way to block the destructive formation of beta-amyloid
from APP. But they are a long way from clinical trials of candidate drugs.
A complementary avenue of research is to use natural chemicals known as
nerve growth factors to regenerate brain cells damaged by Alzheimer's. Then,
in the distant future, it might be possible to stop the amyloid deposition
process at an early stage and to repair any damage that had taken place.
If effective drugs are developed for Alzheimer's disease, it will be all the
more necessary to have accurate tests to diagnose the disease in the early
stages, so that treatment can begin before serious symptoms appear. At
present there are no simple diagnostic tests to distinguish even advanced
Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia with different causes (such as
multi-infarct dementia, the next most common form in elderly patients, in
which a series of small strokes interrupts the blood supply to tiny areas of
the brain).
Only a post-mortem examination of the brain - such as Alois Alzheimer
carried out for his original description of the disease in 1907 - will tell
definitely whether someone suffered from Alzheimer's. But two approaches to
a diagnostic test for living patients are giving promising results in
research.
Brain scans will soon be accurate enough to show the changes characteristic
of the disease. For example, the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and
Ageing, based at the Radcliffe Infirmary, is using X-ray computed tomography
(CT scanning) to reveal Alzheimer's-related shrinkage in part of the brain
that is important in memory, the medial temporal lobe. And Nicholas Fox, an
Alzheimer's Disease Society fellow at St Mary's Hospital Medical School,
plans to detect early degenerative changes in the brain through magnetic
resonance imaging.
Biochemical markers may be used to diagnose the disease and follow its
progress. One candidate is the level of APP in spinal fluid, lower in
Alzheimer's patients (possibly because it is being deposited as beta-amyloid
protein in the brain). Sibia, a Californian biotechnology company, is
developing an antibody-based test based on this observation.
Any company developing an effective drug for Alzheimer's would create a new
world market potentially worth several billion dollars a year. But it would
save at least as much as that by enabling old people to continue living at
home, instead of becoming dependent on the health care system or on family
members who assume what can become a crushing physical and emotional burden
by caring for them.
Above all, an Alzheimer's cure would end the agony for millions of people
who end their lives with minds like dark thunderstorms. A realistic
assessment suggests that people who are now young adults can look forward to
an old age free of Alzheimer's.
The series will continue next month with a look at treatments for the
menopause.

HEALTH; 


NEW PARKINSON'S DRUG HAILED 




From Times wire services 




NEW YORK 




Researchers said today that a new drug dramatically slows the progression of 
Parkinson's disease and should be used in all patients with early stages of the 
debilitating nerve illness. 


Based on preliminary results of a large-scale study, the researchers said the 
drug deprenyl delays the onset of advanced symptoms of Parkinson's by at least 
one year and is remarkably safe. 


Parkinson's is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that mostly strikes 
people over 40. About 500,000 Americans suffer from it. 


"I strongly recommend that all patients with early Parkinson's be considered 
for this therapy," said Ira Shulson, a neurologist at the University of 
Rochester in Rochester, N.Y., and the study's principal investigator.

FETAL CELL'S UNIQUENESS AT BASE OF DEBATE 




By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 




WASHINGTON 




The ethical battle over using fetal tissue is the battle over abortions one 
step removed. 


On one side are the scientists who feel that fetuses are available and it would 
be a shame not to put them to some positive use, such as helping victims of 
degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. 


On the other side are those who think sanctioning the use of fetal tissue might 
encourage abortions as a source of such material. 


"The analogy that is made, which is a very difficult analogy, is would you use 
kidneys from concentration camps for transplantation?" said Robert C. 
Baumiller, director of the Division of Genetics at Georgetown University, in a 
recent interview. 


"Depending on where you are on the abortion question, you would be using for 
good, parts of those who improperly had their lives taken," he said. 


A ban on using federal money for fetal tissue research was imposed a year ago, 
and James Mason, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and 
Human Services said he intends to continue it indefinitely. 


Fetal cells are valued by researchers, he said, because they still are in the 
process of developing. 


"What a fetal cell does better than any cell from an individual after birth is 
grow," he said. "There are growth factors present within a fetal human which 
are unique to that system; they have a vitality that is unique." 


But, said Baumiller, no one really knows how that vitality might be transferred 
from cell to cell. 


Some experts believe it may be possible to treat a variety of diseases by 
transplanting tissue taken from aborted fetuses. There were especially hopeful 
signs in use of such tissues in treating Parkinson's Disease. 


"Because of Parkinson's, we think there might be some advantage with other 
neurological degenerative diseases, especially those with cells which are kind 
of sister cells," said Baumiller. "The next question would be, if it helps in 
Alzheimer's Disease, could it help perhaps in Huntington's, any place where you 
have a neurological degenerative condition?" 


Dr. Robert Hay, head of the cell culture department of the American Type 
Culture Collection in Rockville, Md., said fetal cells have provided 
information on aging and cell transformation -- the change from normal to 
cancerous properties -- and in virus replication studies and studies of 
chemicals that affect human cells. 


Some argue that there is enough primate research already being carried out that 
no one needs human fetal research. 


"Human cells behave differently than cells from animals," said Hay. "There are 
properties of human cells we obviously need to know about that differ from 
those of a mouse or a rat." 


The ethics of using tissue from aborted fetuses were studied recently by a 
committee at Stanford University, which drew up guidelines that include: 


* Women who undergo abortions should not benefit directly from the medical use 
of their fetuses. They should not be reimbursed for their abortions. 


* Medical personnel who perform abortions also should not profit from use of 
the fetal tissue. 


* Fetal tissue should be treated with the respect given to cadavers. 


* Fetuses should not be aborted for the specific purpose of using their tissue.

SCIENTISTS HARNESSING BODY'S NATURAL AGENTS AS POWERFUL HEALERS 




By LARRY THOMPSON, THE WASHINGTON POST 




Instead of the sharp edge of the scalpel or a massive blast of toxic chemicals 
to wipe out illness, doctors are turning to the body to heal itself. 


They are taking the body's natural products -- hormones, antibodies, enzymes 
and even whole cells -- to attack disease and restore normal functioning. 
Cancer, Parkinson's disease, heart disorders and hormone deficiencies are all 
the targets of this new approach to treating illness. 


Harnessing these new "natural" agents produced by the body might be called 
biological therapy, or biotherapy, much as toxic chemicals used to treat cancer 
are called chemotherapy. 


It all started with the genetic-engineering revolution in the 1970s when 
scientists learned how to manipulate genes in the laboratory. Previously rare 
human proteins -- interferon, interleukin-2, human insulin and human-growth 
factor -- could suddenly be mass produced with these new gene-engineering 
techniques. Although the early experiments in human patients failed to live up 
to expectations, solid gains have been made and physicians remain optimistic 
about the role of biotherapies. 


"In the next decade, the major advance will be genetic therapies," said Bruce 
A. Chabner, director of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer 
treatment. Genetic manipulation, for example, is being increasingly studied as 
a way to fight diseases such as cancer and AIDS. 


The idea of biotherapies has been around for decades, though the first ones 
were crude. Cow insulin, a protein essential for signaling cells to pull sugar 
from the blood, was discovered in the 1920s and injected into the bodies of 
diabetics. 


Vaccination -- the injection of a living but inactive virus or bacteria into 
the body -- showed that it was possible to manipulate the body's natural 
defenses. The immune system was programmed to prevent subsequent infection by 
that particular bacteria or virus. 


Just before World War II, doctors discovered that blood could be transfused 
between individuals. And beginning in the 1960s came the organ transplants -- 
heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidney, even bone marrow. 


The common factor between these now standard treatments is that they use 
natural substances -- cells in the transfusion, organs in the transplants, 
viruses in the vaccines, protein in the insulin. But they are limited. Blood 
doesn't always match; organs are rejected; improperly prepared vaccines can 
cause the disease they were intended to prevent. 


Most of the problems came from incomplete understanding of the biology. The new 
generation of biotherapies is changing that, putting in doctors' hands some of 
the most powerful treatments ever developed. Biotherapies fall, generally, into 
three groups: proteins, genes and cells. 


In the last five years, physicians have been putting to use the natural 
medicines produced for the first time by the biotechnology labs. Genetic 
engineers have learned to put specific human genes into bacteria, turning the 
bacteria into miniature factories that grow large quantities of the human 
proteins doctors can use against a certain disease. The new protein 
biotherapies include: 


* Clot busters. Several natural proteins have been found that rapidly dissolve 
blood clots. Physicians now routinely inject these clot busters to stop heart 
attacks in mid-attack -- something that never had been possible. Additionally, 
these drugs also have been used experimentally to stop strokes and open painful 
blockages in leg arteries. 


* Blood boosters. A set of proteins has been found that stimulate the bone 
marrow to produce both red blood cells and certain types of white blood cells. 
Growing red blood cells is revolutionizing the care for end-stage renal 
failure, which causes the body to stop making blood. Before this discovery, 
these patients needed constant transfusions. 


Stimulating white blood cells boosts immunity to various types of infections. 
It can prevent some of the secondary diseases associated with AIDS. Its most 
important use, however, may be the countering of the immune-destroying effects 
of cancer chemotherapy, thus allowing physicians to treat tumors with larger 
doses of the poisonous drugs and kill the cancer. 


* Height control. Human-growth factor can literally add inches to children of 
short stature. They don't always reach normal height, but they reach heights 
previously impossible. Some also have talked about using this powerful hormone 
for weight loss, and there have been reports of use by some athletes seeking an 
extra edge. 


* Antibodies. The body's immune system produces thousands of different-shaped 
proteins called antibodies that recognize invading bacteria and viruses by 
their shape -- and then attack them. Scientists have learned how to make 
antibodies of any given type -- called monoclonal antibodies -- that can be 
used to diagnose disease both in the lab and in the body and can be used to 
attack cancer cells directly. 


Organ transplants and blood transfusions have led the way in the use of living 
cells or tissues to treat an illness. But the new biotherapies take it all a 
quantum leap further. 


* Brain transplants. Clearly the brain itself cannot be transplanted, but parts 
of the brain wear out for uncertain reasons. Parkinson's disease arises with 
the loss of certain brains cells that produce a chemical needed for normal 
movement. Neurosurgeons have now experimented with transplanting into the brain 
patches of human cells that produce the missing chemical. Preliminary 
experiments with nerve cells taken from aborted fetuses reportedly show 
promise. 


* Tissue transplants. In diabetes, pancreatic cells stop secreting the protein 
insulin. Although insulin can be injected every day, control of blood sugar is 
better when a pancreas is transplanted into the body. A number of human 
experiments are under way to inject just the insulin-making cells in the hope 
that they will work better and be easier to protect from rejection. 


* Killing cancer. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute have found that 
certain white blood cells are primed to attack cancers. They remove those cells 
and stimulate them in the lab with a growth factor called interleukin-2. Once 
several billion of the white blood cells have grown in the lab, they are put 
back into the patient's body and attack the tumor. More than half of the 
patients with the skin cancer malignant melanoma and with kidney cancer now 
respond to this treatment. 


The third general form of biotherapy, genetic, relies on the recent ability to 
insert genes into cells of the body. Genes control the production of proteins, 
so gene transfers can be used to replace a missing protein permanently. This is 
the future of medicine, many believe. About 4,000 inherited diseases could be 
attacked by this technology. 


* First steps. In the first gene transfer experiments in humans, begun last 
year at the National Institutes of Health, cancer researchers put a bacterial 
gene into the white blood cells they already had been turning into cancer 
killers. The gene allows them to track the altered blood cells in the body and 
to see which type best kills the cancer. Future experiments in which other 
genes are added should boost the cell's cancer-killing power. 


* Artificial organs. The biggest problem with gene therapy is getting the 
altered cells back into the body so that they survive. One approach under 
development in animals creates an artificial organ by growing the gene-modified 
cells on a synthetic pad that is surgically placed in the animal's abdomen. 
Hormones are added that make blood vessels grow into the pad. Theoretically, 
the newly created organ could be designed to secrete any protein to treat a 
wide array of illnesses. 


Although the new biotherapies have begun to radically alter the treatment of 
disease, they also have created controversies. For example, some of the tissue 
transplanted for diabetes and Parkinson's comes from aborted fetuses. Groups 
opposed to abortion have so strongly opposed the use of this material that the 
government no longer funds any related research. 


The debate will grow more intense as the massive project to identify and 
analyze every single human gene, now being developed at NIH, gets under way. It 
will speed the ability to detect diseases for which nothing can be done. That 
means doctors will be able to tell which patients are likely to get which 
diseases. Will patients want to know?

EYE ILLNESS TRACED TO MOTHERS 




From Times staff and wire reports 




A genetic defect passed on only by mothers to their children has been linked to 
some eye disorders and a type of epilepsy and may be responsible for even more 
diseases. 


By analyzing patterns of genetic inheritance among several large Georgia 
families and analyzing specific genes, Emory University scientists linked 
genetic flaws in mitochondria, the cell's energy producing bodies, to three 
inherited diseases. 


In a study published recently in the journal Cell, the researchers linked 
mitochondrial defects to a rare disease of the central nervous system called 
myoclonic epilepsy. Its symptoms range from deafness and dementia to breathing 
difficulties and seizures. 


Last summer -- in the first discovery linking mitochondria to an inherited 
disease -- the Emory team reported it associated a mitrochondrial defect to a 
puzzling form of blindness, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. 


The Emory researchers said their discovery may be an important step toward 
diagnosis and treatment of many previously unexplained diseases of the brain, 
heart and nervous system.

REP. UDALL, BATTLING PARKINSON'S DISEASE, FENDS OFF CALLS FOR RETIREMENT 




By DIANE DUSTON, Associated Press 




WASHINGTON 




In the House Interior Committee hearing room hangs a portrait of Chairman 
Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.), standing tall with his coat slung over his shoulder. 
The longtime lawmaker, former presidential candidate and well-known humorist 
appears eager for a challenge. 


But the man occupying the chairman's seat across the room no longer mirrors his 
portrait. He sits stooped in his chair, his hands quivering and his voice 
barely audible. 


Although physically ravaged by Parkinson's disease, Udall, 67, fends off calls 
for his retirement and still gets his message through clearly. 




Replacement Not in Sight 


"My replacement hasn't been born yet," Udall recently told Rep. Ben Nighthorse 
Campbell (D-Colo.), who had the temerity to ask his fellow Democrat whether he 
had been grooming anyone to take over the House seat he's held since 1960. 


"He's as tough as in the portrait," said Rep. John J. Rhodes III (R-Ariz.), 
whose district neighbors Udall's. 


"His mind is still very sharp," said Rep. Don Young of Alaska, the committee's 
ranking Republican. "We've been fighting for 14 or 15 years. I've beat him two 
or three times, but it's very difficult." 


Udall, who once played a year of pro basketball despite having a glass eye and 
unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 1976, has taken 
the disease as a challenge and, his staff says, is fighting it with a sense of 
humor. 


There has never been any doubt about that sense of humor. 




Makes Joke About Disease 


One of the jokes aides like to repeat was used by Udall back when news was 
circulating about Paula Parkinson, a shapely lobbyist whose kiss-and-tell habit 
had many members of Congress nervous. 


"There are two kinds of Parkinson's disease," Udall said. "Both of them give 
you the shakes." 


Although Udall, a liberal, says he doesn't use an iron hand to rule the 
committee, which oversees government lands, it's easy to see that legislation 
he opposes doesn't stand a chance. 


Republicans stalked out of a committee session one day in May when their 
amendments to the Udall-sponsored American Heritage Trust Act were defeated by 
Democratic proxies held by Udall. 


"My style is different," he said in a recent interview. He uses "the merits" to 
argue his position, he said dryly. Pausing, he said, "I jest." 




Defined Power in Washington 


Then, with the sagacity for which he is known, Udall defined power in 
Washington as "the ability for me to have you vote 'aye' when you want to vote 
'no.' " 


"It may be because of a favor from the past, because you like me or because I 
gave time to the opposition," he said. 


Udall was hospitalized in May to have his Parkinson's medication adjusted and 
for treatment of pneumonia. An old friend, Ben Cole, wrote a column for the 
Arizona Republic suggesting that Udall retire. 


"It hurt him," said Cole, former Washington bureau chief for the Republic, 
retired and living in suburban Virginia. "I'm sorry for that." 


But Cole said he sticks by his column. "You can't ask people to stay young 
forever," he said, adding that he fears that people will start taking advantage 
of Udall because of his health. 




Colleagues Support Decision 


Committee colleagues from both parties support Udall's decision to stay. 


"We owe him," Young said. "Even though we are adversaries on many issues (and) 
our philosophies are different . . . I respect him very much." 


Another frequent adversary on the committee, Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.), said 
he would "support Mr. Udall for as long as he chooses to come to Congress. I 
have the greatest respect for him." 


Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, mentioned by Cole as someone who knew when 
it was time to pass the burden to younger shoulders, wrote Udall after the 
column was published. 


"Your fellow Arizonans are sitting out here, reading that everybody in the Land 
of Oz is urging you to step down and come home," Goldwater said. 




'To Hell With Advisers' 


"I hope to God you do what you want to do, to hell with these advisers that 
want you to come back. I'd love to have you in Arizona, with me, (but) to be 
honest with you, I'd rather have you in Washington doing the things you do for 
our state." 


When he was released from the hospital May 26, Udall's doctors told him to rest 
for a week or two. Five days later, he was back in his office. 


"He keeps very active, which is very important," said Frank Williams, executive 
director of the American Parkinson's Disease Assn., of which Udall is honorary 
chairman. 


Williams acknowledged that at times Udall looks bad, but said Parkinson's 
patients have intact mental abilities. 


"They do not lose their faculties," he said. "They watch their body deteriorate 
day after day." 




Battled Illness for 10 Years 


Williams said some people function for 25 to 30 years with the disease. Udall 
has battled it for about 10. He also suffers from arthritis, said an aide, 
which accounts for his stoop. 


Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that affects automatic movements, 
forcing sufferers to concentrate on muscle reactions normal people have without 
thinking. 


Another symptom is loss of voice, said Williams. 


Despite that handicap, Udall speaks to other Parkinson's patients at functions 
arranged by the association. "He's an inspiration because he hasn't given up," 
said Williams. 


Many don't want him to. Goldwater gave Udall this advice on detractors: 


"Tell them to go to hell."

WHY DOES THE NOSE KNOW? NO ONE KNOWS 




By JOHN DIAMOND, Associated Press 




BOSTON 




Scientists know a lot about smell. They know that it weakens as we get older, 
that it varies depending on a person's sex and ethnic background and that it 
involves more than just the nose. What they generally don't know is why. 


"Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back seat to the 
other senses, probably because we don't live in an olfactory world. We live in 
a visual world, a world of sounds," said Dr. John S. Kauer, a New England 
Medical Center researcher trying to determine brain function using the nose. 


Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the path of an odor 
impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work produced a "movie," or 
series of color-enhanced pictures, showing that the brain is "a parallel 
processor," handling many signals simultaneously, like a supercomputer. 




Alzheimer's Link 


The research may have implications for the study and treatment of brain tumors 
by helping differentiate between tumors and normal tissue. 


Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory oddities as a 
link between premature decline in smell and Alzheimer's disease, a protein that 
ferries odor molecules through the nose, the fact that half of all people 
between ages 65 and 80 suffer major loss in the sense of smell and the trait 
peculiar to some nasal nerve cells to regenerate. 


"They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this spontaneous 
renewal and spontaneous decay," Kauer said. 


Some of the research in the field of smell is aimed not at medical advancement 
but at the bottom line. In Union Beach, N.J., Dr. Craig Warren heads a research 
and development team for International Fragrances and Flavors Inc., a company 
that produces scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by hundreds of 
companies around the world. 


Smell, Warren said, "is the one sense for which the mechanism for perception is 
unknown." Scientists know how odor molecules are gathered by smell neurons, but 
they don't know how a few similar types of receptor cells can distinguish 
between thousands of different odors. 


Research suggests that the process of smelling involves more than the nose, 
Warren said. When blindfolded, "Most people cannot discriminate a lemon from a 
lime or an orange from a grapefruit." 




Small Samplers 


International Fragrances and Flavors regularly brings in dozens of smell 
samplers, usually women, to rate and react to fragrances, with emphasis on how 
the fragrances can alter mood. In the process, Warren has found that 10% to 15% 
of the subjects display a particularly acute sense of smell. 


At the opposite end of the spectrum are those with no sense of smell. 


Mary Brooks, 35, of Philadelphia, took an uncommon route to this fairly common 
problem. Beginning in 1972 she began to experience what amounted to smell 
hallucinations; she thought she smelled an unpleasant odor when there was no 
odor present. Years of anguish and unsuccessful treatment finally led to brain 
surgery in which her olfactory nerve was removed, ending her hallucinations but 
leaving her incapable of smelling. 


"It can be very dangerous," she said. "I've already burnt things in the oven 
and I didn't know it, and there are smoke alarms everywhere. But on the other 
hand, it doesn't bother me not to smell because I still sense that I'm 
breathing and smelling the same as you are." 


Brooks' doctor was Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania 
Smell and Taste Center. Patients include the aged and professionals like wine 
tasters, firefighters, police officers, gas company workers, inspectors and 
cooks whose lives and livelihoods can depend on the sense of smell. 


"There have always been problems that people had and they've had no place to 
turn in the past," Doty said. "It's a frontier of science which really hasn't 
even been touched on." 


That's no accident, Kauer said. "Our world doesn't require it. We really don't 
go out and forage for food by sniffing along the ground. That evolution took 
place millions of years ago." 


Doty, Daniel A. Deems and Stanley Stellar published a report in August in the 
journal Neurology linking the loss of smell and Parkinson's disease. A year 
earlier, a similar study linked the loss of smell to Alzheimer's disease. A new 
area of research will try to determine if the nasal passage serves as a pathway 
for viruses or chemicals that contribute to those maladies, Doty said. 


The general subject headings scientists have explored give an idea of the scope 
of smell research: the influence of body tilt on the sense of smell and the 
effects of mouth movement, swallowing and spitting. 


Studies of ethnic groups have turned up some interesting distinctions: 
Korean-Americans appeared to have particularly acute ability to identify 
smells. Black Americans in one sampling had trouble with cedar and cheddar 
cheese. Whites had trouble with gingerbread. Native Japanese scored poorly on 
clove and fruit punch. 


Despite this mountain of research, a key question that puzzles scientists is 
precisely how the sense of smell works. 


At Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Solomon Snyder identified a carrier protein 
last summer that ferries odor molecules up the nose. The discovery occurred 
inadvertently in a search for receptors that play a key role in distinguishing 
smells, Snyder said. 


"But another possibility as to why the receptors haven't been found is that 
they don't exist." 


Other factors -- sight, sound and environment, for example -- help provide the 
brain with cues in identifying smells, he said, but "the fundamental 
discrimination is going to be in the nose."

IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 


CONTAMINANT BLAMED FOR AILMENT 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




A contaminant found in mussels apparently caused an unusual and irreversible 
long-term memory loss in 14 people in Canada in late 1987, scientists reported 
last week. A toxin called domoic acid produced by a common seaweed appears to 
have destroyed brain cells, leaving 13 of the victims permanently disabled. 


While no other cases are believed to have occurred, the incident led to changes 
in the way mussels are labeled and tested in Canada and prompted an extensive 
testing program for domoic acid in Maine, which produces 85% of mussels in the 
United States. 


Domoic acid apparently creates hyperactivity in brain cells and "makes the 
cells almost commit suicide," said Dr. Neil Cashman, a neurologist and 
co-author of one of two studies on the mussel contamination published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine. 


In one study, the toxin caused a variety of symptoms, including vomiting, 
abdominal cramps, diarrhea and severe headaches; 25% of those affected suffered 
short-term memory losses. 


The research could have implications for understanding such devastating brain 
disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, which some 
scientists suspect may involve a toxin, Cashman said.

MEDICINE: ARTHRITIS; 


STUDY OF RATS LINKS DISEASE TO DEFECT IN BRAIN'S STRESS RESPONSE 




By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 




Individuals who are calm and easygoing, unflappable in the face of a crisis, 
may be more susceptible to arthritis than those who are more excitable, 
according to a new study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. 


The researchers have traced arthritis susceptibility in rats to a defect in the 
brain's regulation of the stress response, the first time the crippling disease 
has been linked to temperament or behavior. 


If their discovery, recently reported in the prestigious Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences, is confirmed in human studies that are now 
beginning, it may lead to new ways to screen for arthritis susceptibility and 
to new treatments directed at stress-sensitive brain circuits. 


The discovery is "a very significant observation" that may also have widespread 
application in the study of other "autoimmune" diseases such as diabetes and 
multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks its host, said 
endocrinologist Allan Munck of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. 


Arthritis, which is characterized by swelling or deterioration of the joints, 
aches, stiffness and fatigue, is the nation's primary crippler. More than 1 
million Americans develop arthritis each year and an estimated 35 million -- 
one in every seven Americans -- suffer its symptoms. It is two to three times 
as common among women as among men. 


Together, the various forms of arthritis account for 27 million lost workdays 
annually and cost the U.S. economy an estimated $8.6 billion per year, 
including $4.4 billion in hospital and nursing home services, according to the 
Arthritis Foundation. 


Scientists have long known that certain genes associated with the immune system 
create a predisposition to arthritis, in which white blood cells severely 
damage the protective membranes surrounding the joints. Environmental insults 
to the body -- the pounding on the joints caused by jogging, for instance -- 
also trigger arthritis. 


Some people with genetic susceptibility do not develop the disease, however, 
and researchers have long believed that some other factor must be involved. The 
NIH researchers now believe that they have identified that factor. 


Rhematologists Esther M. Sternberg of the National Institute of Mental Health 
and Ronald L. Wilder of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal 
and Skin Diseases in Bethesda, Md., have been working with two strains of rats, 
one of which is highly susceptible to arthritis and one that isn't. 


When cell walls of streptococcus bacteria are injected into the joints of the 
one strain of rats, called the Lewis strain, white blood cells from the immune 
system attack the joints as well as the injected cellular material. They 
produce swelling and inflammation leading to an arthritis that is "remarkably 
similar to the human disease," Wilder said. 


But when the same bacterial material is injected into another strain, called 
the Fischer strain, little or no inflammation occurs and the rats remain 
healthy. Wilder and others have been searching for many years for the 
biochemical difference between these two strains of rats in the belief that the 
knowledge could hold a clue to understanding human arthritis. 


Sternberg, in contrast, has been examining ways in which the brain might be 
involved in arthritis. One way is in the production of hormones called 
corticosteroids, which are the most potent naturally occurring suppressors of 
inflammation. The synthetic corticosteroid cortisone, for example, has been 
used to treat arthritis since the 1940s. 


Corticosteroids are produced by the adrenal glands, walnut-sized organs that 
sit atop the kidneys, in response to a chemical signal secreted by the part of 
the brain known as the hypothalamus. That signal is a hormone called CRH. 


Sternberg's contribution was the recognition that this process of controlling 
the immune response is stimulated by production of CRH in response to a 
chemical released by the white blood cells at the site of the inflammation. 


To test the theory, Sternberg and Wilder gave the rats a chemical that blocked 
CRH production at the same time that they injected the rats with bacterial 
cells. Within hours after the injection, the arthritis-resistant Lewis rats 
began getting developing arthritis. By stopping CRH production, the researchers 
had removed normal restraints on the rats' immune systems, and they were 
ravaged by their own runaway immune responses. 


Subsequent research showed that the arthritis-prone Fischer rats had a similar, 
naturally occurring block in CRH production that caused arthritis. "Although 
the disease is in the joints, the defect is in the brains," Wilder said. 


The defect lies in the region of the brain that controls the animals' response 
to stress. The researchers do not yet know if the defect causes any behavioral 
abnormalities in the Fischer rats because no one had thought to look for such 
abnormalities before. But Wilder is looking now. 


Meanwhile, the researchers are designing studies to determine if the same type 
of defect -- where there is an inadequate response to stress -- is present in 
the brains of humans who develop or are susceptible to arthritis. 


"You run into people who panic under trivial conditions," Wilder said. "Others, 
nothing seems to upset them." Those differences in response might be linked to 
the same type of defect observed in the mice. 


The brain defect may also play a role in other autoimmune diseases, such as 
multiple sclerosis. The arthritis-prone Fischer rats can develop a disease very 
much like MS if they are injected with ground-up nerve tissue. And British 
researchers have recently shown that naturally occurring corticosteroids can 
induce a spontaneous remission from the experimentally induced disease, 
indicating a link between the brain and immune systems. 


Wilder and Sternberg are encouraged about the possibility that a brain defect 
will be found in humans because NIH researchers have recently shown that 
defects in CRH production can cause depression, and persistent depression has 
long been associated with arthritis. 


"A number of drugs that they use to correct depression . . . really do reset 
the immune response," Wilder said. The new results, he added, "give us new 
impetus to look at a large variety of drugs, some in use and some sitting on 
the shelves of research labs at pharmaceutical companies. This gives us a whole 
new way of attempting to correct arthritis susceptibility." 




Clue to Arthritis' Cause 


Researchers create arthritis in susceptible rats by injecting them with 
bacterial cell walls. The rats have a brain defect that prevents the synthesis 
of a hormone called CRH, and white blood cells proliferate freely, damaging the 
joint. In healthy rats, the process works this way: 


1. When researchers inject cell walls into rat joints, white blood cells attack 
the foregin invader. They also release interleukin-1, which travels to the 
brain. 


2. Interleukin-1 stimulates the brain to secrets CRH. 


3. CRH stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete steroids, such as cortisone, 
that suppress white blood cell activity in the joint. The cell walls are 
destroyed, but no joint damage occurs.

Save me from Medical Correctness. Protect me from Healthspeak. Deliver me
from the well-meaning lobby that seeks to bowlderise and sanitise the
language of illness and adversity.
Let me declare an interest. I have Parkinson's Disease. Cabin staff on
airlines size me up in seconds. I make for my seat, unsteady on my pins,
stumbling over the odd word, and displaying that tell-tale tremor. 'What
have we here,' they seem to say. 'He must have drunk half his fare in the
Club Class lounge. One turn at the drinks trolley, and that's his lot.'
I can cope with this. Wear a black armband, is my advice to fellow
tremblers. The crew will then assume that you have been drinking to ease the
pain, and proceed to press double whiskies on you.
And nor do I mind taxi drivers who look the other way when I try to flag
them down, as I stumble out of my office late at night. They suspect that I
might bring up the one-for-the-road in the back of their cab.
But what I cannot abide is Medical Correctness, its patronising language,
and its Orwellian overtones. Is there a reader with a heart so hard that
they were not moved to laughter, or at least an incredulous snort, when they
read that the Spastics Society is to call itself Scope?
Any day now I suspect the Royal Society for the Blind will call itself
Vision, and the Parkinson's Disease Society will rename itself Horizon. Or
possibly Horizon]
One can accept the concern that spastic has become a term of abuse; perhaps
there is a case for a change of name. So why not the Cerebral Palsy Society?
This is dismissed as 'an easy and obvious step' by the society. The term
cerebral palsy is 'limiting, medical and rather ugly and old fashioned'.
Scope, on the other hand 'carries a degree of weight and a feeling of
progress and some other positive associations: opportunity, liberty, elbow
room etc'. The public relations campaign to replace its universally
recognised brand name by this vacuous alternative will, by the way, cost
Pounds 750,000.
I fear the malaise is spreading. The Parkinson's Disease Society is also
tampering with language. Please do not refer to people with Parkinson's as
'victims', or describe them as 'afflicted' by a 'crippling' condition, wrote
the society's press officer in its newsletter last year.
These words were 'judgmental', and bad for morale, readers were told. They
made us tremblers feel 'helpless, bitter and unattractive'. You should not
say that someone 'cannot walk', instead say 'uses a wheelchair'.
This suggestion did not go far enough, I wrote in a facetious letter. 'Words
such as crippling are not only judgmental, they are descriptive - two
disquieting features of far too many words and phrases in the English
language.'
'Clearly it is profoundly offensive to say that someone 'cannot walk'. But
to say instead 'uses a wheelchair', as the newsletter suggested, is
unacceptable,' I argued. 'Let us use the phrase 'enjoys enhanced mobility in
a seated position'.'
Alas, my letter backfired. The society thought I was serious.
But I will return to the fray, for the society recently launched what it
calls an awareness campaign. Its theme suggests that the society's left hand
does not know what its right hand is doing . . . rather like Parkinson's
Disease, come to think of it.
The newsletter describes how the television advertisement 'shows a
footballer striking the ball into the back of the net . . . fans erupt in a
sea of scarves and flags . . . cameras cut to a solitary figure who makes a
stark contrast to the animated activity around him . . . it depicts the
vivid and compelling eyes of someone with Parkinson's Disease, looking out
from a face which seems to be carved out of stone. Parkinson's has turned
this person into a statue.'
Well, it does not do much for my morale, I can tell you. If it raises
awareness, however, and gets research funds rolling in, I'm all for it.
But the society cannot have it both ways. If it does not want Parkinson's to
be called a 'crippling' disease, it should not use a face of stone-like
immobility as a shock tactic to elicit sympathy.
Drop the euphemisms, because they do not help. They do not fool the sick,
and they mislead the healthy.
Sufferers and victims, blind and crippled, let us raise our canes, rattle
our Zimmer frames, roll out our wheelchairs, raise our voices, and together
cry: 'Down with Healthspeak] Away with Welltalk]'
And speak up you silent masses, who are sound in wind and limb, heart and
mind. You may be inhibited for fear of being thought intolerant,
unsympathetic or insensitive - but it is your language that is being
tampered with.
Beware the day when Medical Correctness triumphs, and 'able bodied' and
'healthy' and indeed, 'fit as a fiddle' will be words that incur rebuke.
'How are you feeling,' your GP will ask. 'Not physically challenged, thanks
doctor.'
Medical Correctness is motivated by compassion, but seized by a dangerous
illusion: that if you change words, you change reality.

 [By reporter Toshiaki Arai] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Feb -- China's strongman Deng Xiaoping 
(aged 89) is apparently suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
Various sources of information available in Beijing on Deng's 
physical condition all essentially agree on this point. There 
are even reports circulating that say the Chinese leader, 
appreciating his deteriorating physical condition, has given up 
the idea of visiting Hong Kong, which will be returned to China 
in three-and-a-half years. 
  Parkinson's disease is a nervous disorder that is marked by 
such characteristics as sluggish movement and rigidity of the 
whole body, and for which there is reportedly no cure. The 
disease rarely leads to sudden death among sufferers but they 
are, however, very susceptible to complications. 
  Deng's physical condition, such as his trembling hands, were 
noted in a television broadcast which showed him meeting 
delegates to the CPC convention in October 1992. People in 
Beijing, however, were even more startled when they saw how far 
his condition had deteriorated during his appearance on a 
television newscast on 9 February, the eve of the Spring 
Festival (Chinese New Year). 
  It is said that Deng's dream is to visit Hong Kong in July 
1997 when it is returned to China. Deng himself, however, has 
reportedly acknowledged that this has become seemingly 
impossible. When Deng was 86, he said: "To live past 90 is 
victory." This coming August, Deng will celebrate his 90th 
birthday.
