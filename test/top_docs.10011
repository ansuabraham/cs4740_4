MOURNERS FIGHT BACK TEARS AT SERVICE FOR PAN AM DEAD 




From Reuters 




LOCKERBIE, Scotland 




Hundreds of Americans and other mourners bowed their heads and fought back 
tears Wednesday at a memorial service for the victims of the bombing of Pan 
American World Airways Flight 103. 


British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher stood among 700 people packed into 
Dryfesdale Parish Church as the Rev. James Whyte, head of the Church of 
Scotland, endorsed her call for no retaliation for the attack. 


Sheltering under umbrellas against the rain, local people huddled with visitors 
outside the church to follow the service, relayed by loudspeaker, and remember 
the Dec. 21 disaster. 


"This, we now know, was an act of human wickedness," Whyte said in his sermon 
to relatives, government ministers, politicians, rescue workers and Pan Am 
staff from around the world. "That such carnage of the young and of the 
innocent should have been willed by men in cold and calculated evil, is horror 
upon horror," Whyte said. 


But as the international hunt continued to identify the bombers, he urged the 
congregation to reject the idea of retaliation and further violence. 


"There is nothing that way but bitterness and the destruction of our own 
humanity," he said. 


All 259 passengers and crew aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed 
and 11 people died on the ground when wreckage slammed into Lockerbie, setting 
homes and cars ablaze. 


Inside the church, Thatcher and other members of her government stood alongside 
U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II at the simple, 40-minute ecumenical 
service, which was broadcast live on national television. 




200 Relatives of U.S. Victims 


About 200 relatives of American crash victims were believed to have been flown 
to Lockerbie by Pan Am. 


Wreaths lay piled outside the church and passers-by paused throughout the 
morning to look at sad, rain-soaked flowers outside the town hall, turned into 
a temporary mortuary. 


For the first time since the disaster, helicopters collecting crash debris fell 
silent Wednesday, but police said the search -- covering an area of 150 square 
miles -- was continuing outside the town. 


Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said 242 bodies had been found, of which 149 had 
been identified.

PAN AM PLACES ADS MARKING ANNIVERSARY OF LOCKERBIE BLAST 




By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Pan American World Airways, in advertisements placed Thursday in nine 
newspapers in the United States and Europe, called for a "moment of prayer" for 
the 270 people killed in the terrorist bombing of its Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, a year ago. 


The ad, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Miami Herald 
and USA Today, along with newspapers in Scotland, England and Germany, is 
considered unusual because airlines rarely draw attention to air disasters. 


"We felt we wanted to do something," said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners. 


The carrier also held memorial services for victims at airports in New York, 
London and Frankfurt and flew its flags at half mast. 


The Lockerbie tragedy has haunted Pan Am, which lost $150 million in revenue 
earlier this year in part because fearful travelers avoided the airline. 


The Federal Aviation Administration in September fined the airline $630,000 for 
security violations in Frankfurt, the flight's point of origin, and London, 
where it stopped before exploding in the air on its way to New York. 


The FAA said, however, that it couldn't link the security lapses to the 
bombing. 


Pan Am has said the security problems had been corrected. 


The father of a Lockerbie victim reacted bittersweetly to Pan Am's ad. 


"It is a lovely sentiment," said Robert Berrell of Fargo, N.D., who visited the 
grave of his 20-year-old son, Robert, Thursday. "It's kind of ironic coming 
from Pan Am."

PAN AM BOMBING VICTIMS MOURNED ON 2 CONTINENTS 




From United Press International 




LOCKERBIE, Scotland 




Relatives of the dead of Pan Am Flight 103 mourned on two continents today for 
the 270 people killed exactly a year ago by a bomb that blew the plane out of 
the sky and sent flaming wreckage raining onto tiny Lockerbie. 


About 150 people -- local residents and relatives of U.S. victims -- gathered 
in a rain falling from leaden skies for a service at Lockerbie's Dryfesdale 
Cemetery on the first anniversary of the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster. 


The plane was blown apart by a terrorist bomb at 30,000 feet, showering the 
Scottish border town with liquid fire and pieces of aircraft. All 259 people 
aboard the plane -- many of them going home for the holidays -- and 11 people 
on the ground were killed in Britain's worst air disaster. 


Mourners, their eyes brimming with tears, also marched in New York City in 
memory of Flight 103. Hope Asrelsky of Manhattan lost her daughter Rachel, 21, 
in the explosion. 


"She was coming home for Christmas, and like all of them she didn't make it," 
Asrelsky said. 


"Christmas will continue to be a hard time," she said, her voice cracking. "Our 
lives have changed, totally changed. We lost an important person. All of us 
have. Every last one. These weren't worthless people. They were the very best 
people that were taken." 


Representatives of Pan American World Airways, which today placed notices 
mourning the dead in international newspapers, attended the service at the 
Lockerbie cemetery. 


But the chairman of the group representing British Lockerbie victims, Jim 
Swire, stayed away. Swire, who lost his daughter in the disaster, said he was 
too upset to attend. 


More mourners and sympathizers were expected to jam Lockerbie streets for an 
evening memorial service. 


Pan Am held its own services today at London's Heathrow Airport, West Germany's 
Frankfurt Airport and New York's Kennedy Airport. The airline flew its flags at 
half-staff all day. 


The mourners in Manhattan marched through icy winds and a light snow to a vigil 
at the Pan Am Building on Park Avenue, clutching red tulips and carrying 
placards that read: "When will we take a stand against terrorism?" 


"I want to know why this terrorist act that could have been so easily 
preventable wasn't preventable," said Mary Ellen DeSantis, whose 25-year-old 
nephew was killed.

PRINCE CHARLES VISITS PAN AM CRASH SITE 




From Reuters 




LOCKERBIE, Scotland 




Prince Charles, visibly shocked by lingering signs of damage, received a warm 
welcome Tuesday in this Scottish border town devastated by the Pan Am air 
disaster in which 270 people died. 


His visit followed widespread criticism of the Royal Family for not attending a 
memorial service for victims of the crash of the New York-bound Boeing 747, 
which was destroyed by a bomb on Dec. 21 in Britain's worst air crash. All 259 
aboard the plane and 11 local people died as fire and wreckage rained on 
Lockerbie. 


In the town square on Tuesday 2,000 people, including 800 schoolchildren, 
waited in the freezing wind to catch a glimpse of the 40-year-old prince. 


He laid a wreath at a flower-filled shrine outside the red sandstone town hall.

   NEW YORK


A US jury yesterday found Pan American World Airways guilty of wilful
misconduct in a case filed by relatives of the victims killed in the bombing
of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Pan Am Flight 103 ended in disaster on December 21 1988, when a bomb hidden
inside a portable cassette player tore the jet apart shortly after it left
London for New York. All 259 people on board the Boeing 747, and 11 people
on the ground, were killed.
Yesterday's verdict comes after a civil trial lasting nearly 11 weeks in a
Brooklyn federal court. The plaintiffs are seeking more than Dollars 300m
(Pounds 157m) in damages from the airline and two subsidiaries, Pan American
World Services and Alert Management. Under international treaties, liability
damages are limited to Dollars 75,000 for each victim unless wilful
negligence is proved.
A second phase of the trial, to determine the amount of damages to be
awarded, will now have to take place. No date for this has yet been
scheduled. Pan Am, which stopped operating last year, is also thought likely
to appeal against yesterday's verdict. Lawyers acting for Pan Am and its own
legal department declined to make any immediate comment on the verdict.
The case centred on how the bomb got on board the jet. The plaintiffs argued
that the bomb had been placed in an unaccompanied suitcase, and put on an
Air Malta flight to Frankfurt. This bag, they contended, was then improperly
transferred to Flight 103 by a Pan Am employee. The employee, they
contended, failed to examine the bag and note that it did not belong to
anyone travelling on the flight.
The defence argued that the bag was smuggled into the Pan Am system at
Frankfurt, or even London, by terrorists. Lawyers said the plaintiffs were
seeking 'private vengeance' against the carriers, which had no control over
the disaster.
The jury was also told that the airline had improved security measures in
the months before the disaster.
Pan Am, which had been losing money for many years, went into bankruptcy in
January 1991, and ceased operating last December. Its affairs are still
being wound up, but the airline's insurers would be liable for any damage
award.
Yesterday, Mr Tom Plaskett, who was in charge of Pan Am at the time of the
Lockerbie bombing, claimed that the trial had 'failed to solve the mystery
that is the Lockerbie disaster'.
'Much of what we do know with certainty about Lockerbie was not shared with
this jury. . . We shall endeavour through the appeals process to shed some
light on this uncertainty,' he said.

4 BEGIN 500-MILE RUN IN LONDON TO MARK PAN AM CRASH 




From Reuters 




LONDON 




Four people began a 500-mile run to Lockerbie on Tuesday to memorialize the 270 
people who died last December when a Pan Am jumbo jet was destroyed by a bomb 
and crashed into the small Scottish town. 


The runners left from outside Parliament in central London and are expected to 
arrive in Lockerbie on Sunday. 


"They are all in good spirits despite experiencing cold weather, wind and rain. 
No doubt there will be snow on the route further north," said team spokeswoman 
Shirley Price. 


The runners are Tom Grace, 40, a songwriter from Brooklyn, N.Y., Yves Pool, 35, 
a French circus clown now based in the United States, Eleanor Adams, 41, an 
English mother of three, and Malcolm Campbell, a 55-year-old Scottish 
grandfather.

   AMSTERDAM


THE DEATH toll in Sunday's crash of an El Al cargo aircraft into two
Amsterdam apartment buildings is now thought to be less than the original
estimate of 250, but city officials say the true number may never be known.
Rescue workers have recovered 49 badly burnt bodies and do not expect to
find any more victims in the twisted wreckage of the 80 flats. A city
spokeswoman said the fierce temperatures of the fires which engulfed the
flats meant some bodies might be irrecoverable. The number of dead is still
expected to exceed 49, 'but we are cautiously optimistic that the figure of
250 will prove to be on the high side'.
The Amsterdam rescue team is to be helped by British investigators involved
in the recovery of bodies after the explosion of a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, the town council of Lockerbie sent
a wreath of flowers to Amsterdam to express the town's condolences over the
Dutch air disaster.

From Times wire services 




LOCKERBIE, Scotland 




Prince Charles received a warm welcome today when he toured the small Scottish 
town where a Pan American World Airlines jet crashed last month, killing 270 
people. 


Charles' visit followed widespread criticism that no member of the Royal Family 
had attended a memorial service for victims of the bombing that blew the plane 
out of the night sky Dec. 21. His brother Prince Andrew didn't help matters 
when he visited the town after the crash and expressed sympathy for the 
victims, "especially the Americans." 


Charles appeared to win the hearts of the townspeople as he walked through the 
streets of Lockerbie, visited their homes and even stopped in a pub for a shot 
of whiskey.

LOCKERBIE PLANS U.S.-STYLE PARTY 




From Times wire services 




LOCKERBIE, Scotland 




Pan Am, whose Flight 103 was bombed over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, is throwing a 
party to make up for the Christmas cheer the town missed because of the 
disaster that killed all 259 aboard the New York-bound jet and 11 on the 
ground, an organizer said today. 


Community spokesman Alex McElroy said the idea came from New Jersey schoolboy 
Ed Blaus, who will be attending the American-style barbecue June 3 with his 
parents and three brothers. 


Others expected at the party are Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse, 
folk and rock bands, a football coach and a bagpipe player. 


"Ed's Party," as the event is being called, will be held on Lockerbie's soccer 
ground and 6,500 people from the southern Scottish town and surrounding 
district are invited, McElroy said.

  Tehran JAHAN-E ESLAM 



Language:  Persian 
Article Type:BFN 

 [Unattributed commentary: "Future Efforts"] 
  [Excerpts] Five years after the crash of a Pan American 
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Zionist-influenced mass 
media has started fresh efforts to involve Iran in the issue. 
  The most important document that the Western mass media 
refers to is based on former American spy Lester Coleman's 
allegations that since former British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher implies in her book of memoirs that Libya is innocent, 
therefore Iran is the main culprit in the explosion. [passage 
omitted] 
  In weaving their tale, the Western press also alleges that 
since the condenser on the time bomb used on the Pan American 
aircraft was similar to a condenser that was sold to East 
Germany by a Swiss company in 1985--three years before the 
Lockerbie explosion--and since Ahmad Jibril--whom they believe 
to be responsible for the crash--had good relations with East 
Germany, Iran, and Syria, therefore Tehran and Damascus are 
directly involved in the incident. [passage omitted] 
  On the basis of Zionist propaganda, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and Syria are the main elements behind the American plane 
crash; and according to this propaganda, the reason why Iran and 
Syria have not been prosecuted as the main culprits so far is 
because this has not been deemed politically advisable because 
the United States needed Syria in the war against Iraq and it 
now needs Syria to advance the Middle East peace plan. 
Therefore, this is why only Libya was the target of American 
anger and UN sanctions. [passage omitted] 
  Political observers believe that the current propaganda is 
directly linked with the Islamic Republic's defense of the 
aspirations of the Palestinian people and that the fresh Zionist 
propaganda against Iran after a five-year silence should be 
discussed within the context of the intensification of the 
Palestinian people's struggles and the continuation of the 
Intifadah in the occupied territories. 
  The United States and world Zionism have always considered 
Iran to be the main obstacle to the Middle East peace talks. 
Also, the United States considers its major regional policy to 
be the isolation of Iran and the portrayal of an ugly and harsh 
face of Iran so that the way can be paved for isolating Iran on 
the one hand and for perpetrating numerous crimes on the other, 
especially when one analyzes the downing of the Iranian 
passenger plane over the Persian Gulf. [passage omitted] 
  Apparently the Americans intend to pave the way for more 
instigations in the region through the contrivance of their 
agents. But the American statesmen should not forget the 
disgrace they have suffered in Somalia.

President Hosni Mubarak arrived in Libya yesterday and met Libyan leader
Muammer Gadaffi in an effort to resolve Tripoli's crisis with the west over
the Lockerbie case, AP reports from Cairo.
The meeting comes shortly before the UN Security Council is scheduled to
review air, arms and diplomatic sanctions against Libya. The sanctions were
imposed after Libya refused to hand over to the US or Britain two suspects
in the explosion of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The
bombing killed 270 people.
Since the sanctions took effect on April 15, Egypt has been mediating
between Libya and the west for a diplomatic solution that would forestall
harsher penalties. Egypt and Libya are members of the Arab League and more
than 1m Egyptians work or live in Libya.

FLYING DEATH TOLL TOPS '87 FIGURE 




From Times wire services 




WASHINGTON 




Accidents among U.S. commercial airlines decreased in 1988 but the year-end 
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland sent the annual death toll well above 
the previous year, the government said today. 


The National Transportation Safety Board issued figures showing that the rates 
and total number of accidents dropped significantly from 1987 among major 
airlines and commuter carriers -- with record lows for general domestic 
aviation. Last month's 270 deaths in the crash of Flight 103 in Lockerbie, 
Scotland, however, sent the annual fatality toll among major commercial 
carriers up to 285 from the previous year's 231, according to the preliminary 
statistics.

LIBYA'S General People's Congress (parliament) said yesterdaythat two
Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of the Pan-Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, could be tried in a 'just and fair' court, in a decision that
could open the door for the two to be tried in the west, Reuter reports.
Britain reacted with scepticism. The Foreign Office said Libya had in the
past made several offers, but Britain wanted action not words.
'The bottom line is what the Libyans do, not what they say,' an official
said.
Britain and the US, backed by the United Nations, have demanded that the two
men be handed over for trial in Scotland or the US.

BOMB POSITION LOCATED ON JET 




From Times staff and wire service reports 




LOCKERBIE, Scotland 




Police investigating the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner last month that killed 
270 people said today they have identified the baggage compartment where the 
explosive was hidden, information that would reveal when it was planted. 


Authorities also know the names of passengers aboard Flight 103 whose luggage 
was packed in the baggage container and their backgrounds will be checked, 
police said. 


But Detective Chief Supt. John Orr refused to say if the plastic explosive was 
smuggled on board in Frankfurt, West Germany, where the Pan American World 
Airways flight originated, or at London's Heathrow Airport, where the flight 
and baggage changed planes to a Boeing 747. 


"I may have an indication as to where the baggage . . . came from but I don't 
think it would be helpful here at this time to be specific about it," said Orr, 
who heads the inquiry in the Scottish village of Lockerbie where the plane fell 
from the sky Dec. 21.

   NEW YORK


THE UN Security Council called unanimously on the Libyan government last
night to answer fully official charges that its agents caused the 1988
Lockerbie air disaster and blew up a French airliner in West Africa.
In its resolution, the council strongly deplored 'the fact that the Libyan
government has not yet responded effectively' to requests for co-operation.
It urged Tripoli to provide a full and effective response 'so as to
contribute to the elimination of international terorrism'.
However, the resolution proposed by Britain, France and the US stopped short
of expressly blaming the Libyan government for destroying PanAmerican flight
103 in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives and the UTA flight 772 in
Niger nine months later. That crash took 177 lives.
None the less, the UN action was widely interpreted as a warning to Libya
that it must turn over two alleged terrorists named by Britain and the US in
the Lockerbie case or face a threat of economic sanctions.
France has not requested the extradition of Libyans it suspects of causing
the UTA crash.
At the outset of the debate, Mr Jadallah Belgassem, the Libyan minister for
strategic industries, termed 'completely baseless' evidence uncovered by
British investigators. He said Libya's own inquiries had made no progress,
because Britain, the US and France refused to reveal evidence in their
possession.
Libya had already co-operated and was ready to do so 'to the fullest
extent', but in a legal context not the political one imposed by raising the
question improperly in the Security Council. He cited the 1971 Montreal
Convention for the protection of civil aviation and affirmed Libya's
readiness to abide by it.
Mr Belgassem called for neutral arbitration and referral of the case to the
World Court if that failed.
Sir David Hannay, UK delegate and Security Council president, replied that
the convention was 'simply irrelevant' to the issue. Those accused of
bombing the PanAm flight must face and receive a proper trial that, clearly,
should be held in Scotland or the US.
It was not practical for an international tribunal to conduct a trial and
the World Court had no criminal jurisdiction.
Representatives of Sudan and Iraq, which are not Council members, and the
