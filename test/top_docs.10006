CONTEMPLATING the features of my colleague, Robin Lane Fox, swollen with
rage after his rail journey, I was glad of my decision to parachute into
Hampton Court Flower Show. Europe's largest flower show is a daunting
prospect, even if it is laid out much more spaciously than Chelsea.
The non-gardener might conceivably have a better time at Chelsea's eclectic
rival. There is a vast craft village populated with people selling such
mysterious items as Sugan kitchen chairs made to an ancient Celtic design,
and Karom boards. Husband and wife teams sell personalised copies of their
novels and pressed steel sculptures of 'mystic warriors'.
If, however, it is plants and nurserymen you want to see, there are eight
floral marquees crammed with vendors, eager to sell - and talk. Maybe the
exhibitors in May were just too hot this year to relish a grilling, but this
year, for once, I left Chelsea feeling rather starved of the kind of close
contact with top-class growers which makes the show more than just a
spectacle.
Under Royal Horticultural Society rules, Chelsea exhibitors must wear
jackets and ties. At Hampton Court, anything goes. As the well-dressed David
Pickard, of Meadowcroft Fuschias in Cambridgeshire said: 'Chelsea is the
gentleman's event.' I celebrated the freedom to buy on-the-spot with two of
Pickard's ivy-leaved geraniums, the variegated-leaf L'Elegant and
Barbe-Bleu, a fabulous dark cherry-red which should be more widely-grown
(ring 0487-823333) .
In the marquee given over to the National Council for the Conservation of
Plants and Gardens, I had my first deep discussion at the Norfolk Lavender
stand (0485-70384). Munstead and Hidcote are the lavenders everyone knows,
and every one sells. But are they really the right foil for old roses, or is
the purple just too eye-catching?
Now I think I have the answer in Sawyers, new last year when it was
introduced by Norfolk Lavender. The flowers are spear-shaped and a paler
shade of blue, without being dull. Sawyers grows to 27in, has a long
flowering season and it is as hardy as any lavender can be. Its leaf is a
good grey and bare-rooted stock costs Pounds 2.20.
Anyone who has wasted money on foxtail lilies, eremurus, will appreciate my
envy at Rupert Bowlby's prize-winning stand (0737-642221). How is one to
achieve, year after year, those gorgeous June-flowering spikes in shades of
yellow, orange, and apricot?
Best to play safe, was the advice, and look not at the hybrids but at the
earlier flowering E. himalaicus, which is white, and robustus, pink and
flowering in June. Apparently, they are one of the lesser-known delights of
travelling from Samarkand to the Himalayas and as that would imply, they are
happy to be baked in summer and frozen all winter. They even relish heavy
clay.
With a large budget, one might be tempted by Bowlby's new introduction,
Allium 'Beau Regarde'. It is probably a cross between christophii and
giganteum, and it looks almost alarming hefty, with heads a full 6in across.
The price is equally hefty, Pounds 18 a bulb. Wait a few years, and this
bloated onion should eventually be ours for just a few pounds.
Still thinking about expensive but troublesome bulbs, I had bearded two
helpful Dutchmen from the combined Warmenhoven and de Groot stand (20,
Purbrock Avenue, Watford, WD2 6AD). Amaryllis (hippeastrums, properly) and
crown imperials are not foolproof, but they are exquisite, especially the
former which are appearing in ever more delicious shades.
With hippeastrums, the answer is to choose a pot size only 20 per cent
larger than the bulb, and to plant them half under the soil, immediately
they arrive in September or October - no later. Then give them a frequent
meal of Phostrogen and expect, in almost every case, two stems with six
flowers. Could I economise and hope to enjoy the same display another year?
Possibly, is the answer, but only at the price of remembering to feed weekly
for seven months. Life is perhaps too short.
As for that other show-stopper, Crown Imperial, their short lives are nine
times out of ten, due to the ravages of slugs. Rats, they always say, are
put off by the foxy smell but slugs like nothing better.
My helpful Dutchman told me that the answer was plenty of sand around the
bulb to deter the beasts, although the soil must be good and rich.
So does Hampton Court or any flower show justify its entry fee? Ask
shrewdly, and, in my opinion, it should.

When it comes to personal creativity I am sure that the majority of the
English respond to landscape design and the art of gardening much more than
they do to fine art or architecture. The English are very good at gardening
and, if this year's Chelsea flower show was anything to go by, they are
getting better at it all the time. But gardening is one thing; it is not at
all the same as garden design. Are the English today any good at garden
landscape?
Garden architecture was something easily comprehended by the Edwardians,
like Sir Edwin Lutyens in his partnership with Gertrude Jekyll. They
understood the links between the site and the house and the unifying
creativity of gardening. Today, in a world where everyone is a gardener, it
is fair to ask - is anyone a designer?
At Chelsea the Royal Horticultural Society opens its umbrella to shelter
that strange English phenomenon, 'the gardening world', which includes
amateur lady designers, professional plantsmen and highly qualified
horticulturalists. There is always a smattering of scientists and modicum of
municipalities with dendrologists and flower arrangers lurking between the
tent pegs. Much as I admire what is under the canvas of the giant marquee,
it is the series of small gardens outside that concern me, as examples of
the best of the garden designers' art.
I was struck by two distinctive but related facts at Chelsea this year.
Firstly, it is OK to be wild. To scatter the wild flower seeds liberally
wherever possible appears de rigueur, with meadows replacing lawns and
nature ever creeping closer to the house. Secondly, it is very much OK to be
picturesque - in your garden planning and in your planting. Colours are
softening, scent is back to attract the bees and butterflies, and there is
much less effort by growers to produce exotic blue roses or striped
daffodils. It is sophisticated, as always, to be simple.
There were several examples of this school of thought. The very best was the
most beautiful creation designed by Arabella Lennox-Boyd for her sponsors,
The Daily Telegraph. She brought young woodland to Chelsea in the form of a
grove of birches gathered around a stream. There is an island in the stream
and on it stands a ruined and weathered stone tower. The woodland is planted
with gunnera and arum lilies, but these relatively exotic plants grow from
the naturalised planting of periwinkle, Solomon's Seal and cranesbills.
There is a pleasing atmosphere of age and neglect: you are not certain what
has happened; has the wood encroached upon a garden, or has a garden spread
casually into the wood? There is wisteria and philadelphus almost reverting
to the wild. Arabella Lennox-Boyd understands that it is possible to create
a microcosm of enhanced nature as a garden.
It is nature that shows us how to design a garden, and we have to understand
the harmony that is possible between man and nature. I like the quotation
from the Sir George Sitwell, who spent his life enhancing nature: 'As the
years pass by and no rude hand disturbs the traces of her presence, nature
becomes more daring.' If nature was allowed to grow gently over the remains
of a Chelsea flower show, what a wonderful garden would be created]
The other garden I liked at Chelsea was a great contrast to Mrs
Lennox-Boyd's romantic wood. The Evening Standard commissioned a very young
designer, Daniel Pearson, to design a 'contemporary London garden'. He also
shares the current wish to bring wildness into the garden design equation.
He achieves this by stylising nature. There is a raised circle of grass and
buttercups around a small fountain. The flat roof of the house is planted
with grass and wild flowers, and the outdoor table has been planted with a
tablecloth of wild thyme. Pearson has a wonderful colour sense, using a
palette of blue and purple plants with grey slate for the paths. But the
idea of using mosaics as part of his decorative scheme has not worked: the
quality of their designs is inadequate and is overwhelmed by the sheer skill
and subtlety of Mr Pearson's plantings.
The idea of art imitating nature was also demonstrated at Chelsea by the
recreation of a part of the 1870 Pulham Rock gardens from the Rothschild's
Waddesdon Manor estate in Buckinghamshire. These remarkable Victorian
gardens with cliffs of artificial stone (an invention of Mr Pulham) and
waterfalls are being restored at Waddesdon by Julian and Isabel Bannerman,
who have brought a fragment of their work to Chelsea with the help of
Clifton Landscape and Design. Again nature triumphs, although the whole
thing is man made.
There was one other garden designer who takes nature as her theme. Julie
Toll brought sand dunes and the seaside to Chelsea with a sandy coastal
garden planted with all the appropriate wild flowers. Her natural scheme
again had the effect of making the more elaborate and cultivated gardens
look almost vulgar.
Good design is often about a return to the sources and Chelsea this year
offered several examples of designers who understand this principle. Great
English gardeners and landscape designers like Capability Brown and Humphry
Repton understood that nature is the source and inspiration. Man's
intervention has to be in harmony. This message has reached Chelsea - may it
spread to all garden centres.

THE WEATHER has been kinder to Chelsea flower show exhibitors than in any of
the last three years. It is the first green spring for much too long and no
doubt the sights will be wonderful - both the flowers and the gardening
public in the flesh.
Certainly, garden accessories will be ever more in evidence, although I know
before I start that I will never bring myself to afford a pseudo-Victorian
greenhouse. Before we are all swept away with Marquee Madness, I would like
to put in a word for things which will not be there.
They are not only the large numbers of gardeners who cannot face
traffic-jams and do not like coaches. They are fields of unattended
buttercups, now at their best; the last of the Pheasant Eye narcissi among
cow parsley and long grass; huge lilacs bulging over urban walls; woods of
bluebells which refute the notion that our world is already warming; clouds
of flower on the best of all late-flowering cherries, the white Prunus
longipes, with blossom dangling on long stems, like cherries, fit to be worn
as earrings.
Nothing mature can be shown at Chelsea, nothing as tall as the off-white
Staphylea, which is dominating one of my local bus-stops, nor the huge bulk
of single-flowered white Rubus Benenden, the stems have such a freshness
throughout the summer. Chelsea is artificial, a suspension of disbelief.
This weekend I can still disbelieve it, especially when looking at the
daphnes in my garden.
Of all the noble families, daphnes are particularly ill-suited to
flower-shows. I have never seen a really happy daphne at Chelsea, except for
a female namesake, and I doubt if we ever shall. Right now, some of the best
forms are at their peak, but daphnes would refuse to move to a show because
their roots detest disturbance. Whatever you see next week, it will not be
fully indicative of May's best shrubs.
Over the years I have grown about a dozen varieties, killed a few of them,
and left others behind when moving house. I have tangutica progressing
slowly but healthily from cuttings; my retusa is less than one foot high and
wide after nine years; I no longer have the scented white-flowered
blagayana, which hugged the ground for five years and threw off a wonderful
sweetness until it died, as usual, before reaching middle-age.
I have had Daphne odora - both green and golden forms - in pots and under
windows, often developing those bare lower stems and rather pale buds, which
never match the bushes beside other people's doors. This golden-leaved
daphne is one of the essential plants, easily rooted from cuttings. Its
master, the late E A Bowles, once wrote that it needs 'a corner outside by
kitchen and chimney, the sort of place where the cat goes to bed and where
blue bottles sit on the wall in late autumn.' There are no flies on the cats
who visit from neighbouring gardens.
These daphnes are not all easy, but I have at last found the best for my
type of gardening, late in my progress through the family. It is not the
tall, easy Daphne Somerset which is leafy and makes a broad, unusual hedge.
It is the daphne from Naples, which reached England in the Regency era and
has behaved with quiet good sense ever since. I seldom notice it in other
gardens, except in the forecourt of Jenkyn Place, near Alton, Hampshire,
where I first woke up to its merits. It grows about two feet high; it is
completely hardy; its rather dark leaves are evergreen and vaguely reflect
light; it will grow on any soil, hot, acid or not, so long as the drainage
is sharp and the roots are free from interference. It seems to revel in
rotted pig manure, and its flowers are a muted rose-pink, which lasts for
about a month, until late May. It has a glorious scent, especially on cold
evenings.
For impact, exhibitors would probably prefer my other performer, a ruby-red
mat of flowers, which is known as Daphne Cneorum eximia. I am hesitant about
the name because all our true eximia derives from a wonder plant, owned by
the late A T Johnson, one of those rare gardening columnists who added as
much to nursery-lists as to the newspaper columns. His daphne hugs the
ground and has flowers of a rich red with a notable scent.
Some of the forms on sale seem to me to be paler than others: the
founder-parent is said to have grown to the amazing width of 6 ft. I can
almost vouch for this size on a plant in a previous garden: it grew in full
sun and the rich soil which this easy variety likes. It derived from a
cutting of a marvellous parent, still to be seen this month on the old rock
garden at Waterperry, open to the public, near Oxford.
I have never seen the Neapolitan daphne near Naples. I have never seen
Cneorum, except in the Dolomites among powder-blue alpine clematis. In the
Pyrenees, there have been reports of a plain Daphne Cneorum, which is even
more sumptuous. This weekend, I would settle for the easy eximia, one of
those scented shrubs which exhibitors may show in miniature on a table for
alpines at Chelsea, but which will never be seen on exhibition at its true
width and glory. Some of the best things in life cannot be shown off: it may
help to remember this law of nature when you struggle to see through the
crowds what exhibitors can still display at its best.

Great Marquee. Miss these bravura displays and I am tempted to say you have
missed the heart of the world's greatest flower show.
Every year, the celebrated Woodford Brothers of Stratford-upon-Avon arrange
a glorious symphony of lupins. Warmenhoven's bowls of enormous tulips always
hold me spellbound, as do Brenda Hyatt's extraordinary auriculas. Equally
unmissable are Blackmore &amp; Langdon's begonias and delphiniums and S &amp; N
Brackley's sweet peas.
For floral perfection, look to the fuchsia displays (Potash Nursery and
Roualeyn Nursery). Indoor gardeners are always well served at Chelsea - year
after year, Dibleys' stand has inspired people with a passion for
streptocarpus, one of the most charming and easiest of flowering
house-plants.
Pleiones always look tempting on Butterfields Nursery's stand. Tropical Rain
Forest's display of bromeliads or 'air plants' can be relied upon to
fascinate.
Serious plant hunters must look for two specialist shrub and tree nurseries.
Mallet Court Nursery's owner is something of a plant-collector. He displays
rarities such as Tapiscia sinensis (an anagram of pistacia), raised from
seed sent from China, Pterocarya insignis, and exotic oaks grown from seed
collected in the mountains of Mexico. Acer enthusiasts should inspect
Millicient, a jazzy variety of Acer morrisonense Hayata.
Bluebell Nurseries of Swadlincote in Derbyshire is another connoisseurs'
nursery, and it boasts Sinocalycanthus chinensis, a shrub with white flowers
in June. It also exhibits Caragana jubata, described as a strange, shaggy
Mongolian affair, and Senecio gnapholodes, a prostrate willow-like plant
from Crete.
Several delphiniums make their debut, among them Albert Sheppard from
perennial specialists Rougham Hall, and salmon-pink Princess Caroline from
Burncoose. A Dutch creation, it achieves the long looked-for goal of a
tall-growing red delphinium which can be grown out of doors.
Variegation is an easy way to stand out in a crowd. This year Bressingham
Gardens is launching Polemonium Brise d'Anjou, discovered in France. I also
look forward to their new verbena Homestead Purple.
Even more eagerly anticipated are the year's new clematis exhibited by
Valley Clematis, which always makes a lovely show. Lady in Red sounds
intriguing if alarming, with its orangey-red flowers. There are five new
varieties from the US and Guernsey. Arctic Queen sounds like a winner if it
is true that here is a double white which really is double and floriferous
for the whole season.
Gardeners can rely on unearthing something to their advantage in the
educational section. If there is something nasty in the lawn, the Institute
of Groundsmanship will analyse specimens. This year the University of
Reading addresses itself to the compelling problem of pest control. And at
the Plantlife stand you can do your bit for the environment by joining the
Great Hedge Scheme.
This year's show gardens more than ever are linked to charities. Watch out
for the gardens for the blind, for allergy sufferers, for people with
learning disabilities, families with sick children, and even a holistic
garden for the terminally ill.

Every year, I vow to go to look, not to shop, and I end up lop-sided with
bags of plants. Last weekend, the crowds poured into the Hampton Court
Flower Show; marvellous rubbish was changing hands in the craft village;
wooden trellis was being booked up by the 100 metres; after two hours, most
of us thought of joining the stand called Glazed Additions because it
matched the look on our faces.
Remember that the British like shopping somewhere other than the high
street. At horse shows, they want to buy suede and leather; at dog shows, I
have seen them buying carpet; at flower shows, they will buy anything in
frames or blue and white number-plates to give a French look to the front of
the house.
Hampton Court strives hard to show flowers under canvas and, this year, the
sweet peas, half-hardy perennials and the border plants from Bressingham
were up to Chelsea standards. But if anyone thinks that it is the new
Chelsea of the future, they are horticulturally impoverished.
There were some brave exceptions but the sponsored theme tent for
international gardens led to the inevitable attempt to do too much in a too
small, publicity-centred space: how could anyone believe that they were
being shown the essential art of Italy and its great former garden at La
Mortola in a confined space under canvas, even allowing for the awkward fact
that its Italian committee of university inheritors are widely agreed to
have ruined the style of La Mortola and its English origins anyway?
The Royal Horticultural Society has taken the Hampton show under its care
after previous confusions in the partnership with Network SouthEast. The
nursery exhibits seldom have the scale or combined impact of Chelsea's main
tent and the outdoor gardens are on the lower end of Chelsea's very low
scale.
The supreme distinction of Hampton Court is the scope for shopping. I fear
that it may dent Chelsea - but only because it occupies different ground.
Once you allow the public to shop on it, they will career downmarket like
Gadarene swine. As Gadarene as the best of them, I think I have avoided pigs
in a poke.
The fact is that after five years of bagging and buying at Hampton Court, my
garden wears a new look. It is at this show that I really appreciate the
strength of the new Alstro-emerias, which have been steadily produced by
Peter Smith, of Chanctonbury Nurseries, Ashington, West Sussex.
This weekend sees their lesser relations, the old Peruvian lilies and Ligtu
forms, just ending their handsome season of flower. Peter Smith's new
varieties will continue for months and some of the best are unarguably
hardy. There is no disputing the strength and hardiness of its Little
Princess forms, which flower at a height of about a foot, last for weeks and
have the exquisite markings which you find on their cousins in florists'
shops.
Many gardeners rightly hate novelties and mini-plants but I do urge you to
try these splendid innovations where you have a sunny bed and a light, open
soil. They are extremely easy, although they disappear below ground in late
autumn: I doubt if half-hearted gardeners could kill them.
Dodging the conservatories and wrought iron, I always head for the
conservation tent, where the plants are more unusual and the crowds are less
frantic. Here, too, I have struck gold.
The best exhibits are backed by the National Conservation of Plants and
Gardens Collections, which aims to conserve a wide range of varieties in
major families of use to the gardener. This year's exhibit of the new Day
Lilies made me wonder whether anyone will conserve most of them in 50 years.
Much of the breeding seems to be stuck with the search for ever-hotter
colours and smaller stems: the orange-yellow Stella D'Oro has turned out to
be a shocker, as many of us verified when walking past the rather dreary
plantings in the gardens of Hampton Court Palace itself.
However, the pale yellow Giant Moon has real class and I am glad of its cool
colour and vigour in the front to middle row of a border. I made positive
notes on Michelle Coe, a tall, pale peach, and Chicago Picottee Pride, both
of which are in softer colours than many of the newest breaks.
The moral of all this study is that we should never risk buying a new Day
Lily blind: the strength of colouring can be most misleading. The effort to
find the best is worthwhile because these plants really do block out weeds
and last for years without attention.
I rank them second only to my essential answer to gardening without effort
in shade or any difficult soil: the matchless Geranium endressii.
Hampton Court has also alerted me to a new trick: the special merit of the
new Wageningen variety, the flowers of which are a particularly clear and
strong pink. If you have a choice, opt for it first.
At Hampton, I feel more in the mood for Ceanothus than at Chelsea, when
their season is not far advanced. Specialists allow us to compare a wide
range, some of them new from west America or the Antipodes. They are also
prepared to discuss the difficult question of hardiness, the fact which
rules out most of the best.
I return to the strong blue of Concha and also Edinburgh, neither of which
is entirely trustworthy in a serious winter. They grow so fast that they are
worth a gamble anywhere but I continue to be most thankful for one of the
commonest forms.
The sky-blue Gloire de Versailles will grow anywhere on well-drained soil.
It is at its absolute best in big Hampshire gardens from this weekend
onwards, where it stands among old roses as a free shrub in its own right.
It picks up the show this weekend when the roses are fading and, after four
winters with me, it has shown no serious loss. Each spring, pruning should
be light. Impatient gardeners would love it as a filling between slower
plants in a new garden wherever there is warmth and shelter.
Lastly, the return of an old favourite. Our grandfathers grew lots of the
tall, lemon-yellow daisies of Anthemis Wargrave throughout their herbaceous
borders, but the mad keen gardeners of the 1970s managed to lose most of the
stock. Three years ago, I thought I had found it but it turned out to be the
shorter, and more vivid, Anthemis EC Buxton, which has supplanted it in
common nurseries. Did no one remember the height and paleness of the true
daisies which were upheld in iron plant-hoops in my early years?
At Hampton Court, the real Wargrave surfaced - alive and well at Pounds 3 a
plant from Rushfields, of Ross Road, Ledbury, Herefordshire. Rushfields is
expert at staging displays of the softer colours among border plants and
last week it confirmed that Wargrave was still in good supply. I left
Hampton Court reunited with this long-lost friend.

UNTIL THIS Monday, I have always thought that in gardening circles, H T
stands for a Hybrid Tea rose. Near the exit to Chelsea flower show, I learnt
this week that it stands for something else: Horticultural Therapy, for
those who want to garden but are disabled.
By the Chelsea exit, all legs ache and the mind becomes hazy. The H T stand
was strategically placed and a positive woman in navy blue explained with
enthusiasm: No, H T could not help just now if my feet were about to fall
off, but she could help if the worst came to the worst and I went blind, for
example.
Perhaps the colour-planners of most of the outdoor gardens at Chelsea have
been needing H T all these years. They are still capable of some
extraordinarily awful colour schemes which are not much of an advertisement
for the great English garden: Wyevale gardens surprised all sensitive eyes
this year with its attempted echo of Scotland.
I thought the best was the Daily Mirror's design because it combined odd
angles and not too many plants, all of a civilised colour. For once, I could
imagine inhabiting a Chelsea exhibit for more than half an hour.
This year, many exhibitors favoured the long-eared Lavender Stoechas,
especially the pedunculata form, and the Mirror had majored on it, perhaps
implying that it would be hardy in most of the British Isles. Do not be
tempted, because it is not.
The Daily Telegraph tried a different image of temptation, a Vision of
Paradise with overtones sometimes said to be Persian, sometimes Islamic or
sometimes simply Eastern.
Much of the planting was pretty, although the Turkish sort of tent at the
back was a bit rich: Moslems might be surprised to find this rather eclectic
design claiming an historic semi-Islamic origin.
Further down the bank, the heroic exhibitor of the first garden ever to be
shown from Uzbekistan might have once known better what made a truly Eastern
paradise. Years of political slavery and the backwash of modernism had
reduced it to some hard and bright surfaces and beastly dots of red salvia.
Horticulturally, the main therapy is always found inside the main tent. Each
year, the smaller herbaceous nurseries consolidate their advance at the
expense of many of the older and bigger enterprises.
The grandeur of the 1950s has gradually faded. Most of the specialists in
these smaller concerns have brought a greater sensitivity to colour and
arrangement.
Glebe Cottage, Foxgrove, Four Seasons and Rushfields are some of the names
which show herbaceous plants with particular elegance. This year, Four
Seasons from Norfolk had hit the mark superbly with a harmony of white, pale
yellow and shades of pink.
Meanwhile, Blooms of Bressingham, Norfolk, is there as a reminder that big
can also be beautiful. Yet another fine exhibit from this large company
encouraged me to follow up Hucherella Charles Bloom because its darkish
leaves are not too sombre and its haze of peach-pink flowers looked
exquisite. It will also grow in shade.
At a lower height, the second Chelsea exhibit of the Hileys from south
London was full of temptations and half-hardy rarities. We swopped notes on
the winter deaths among penstemons, agreeing that the white had been hardest
hit; we admired the aromatic leaves of their Salvia discolor and its black
flowers; I was drawn to one of the old forms of mauve Cherry Pie which has
to be bought as plants from cuttings because they smell so much more sweetly
than any which grow nowadays from seed.
Gardens could hardly have been hotter or more dry this week. Perhaps as a
result, I was particularly drawn to a cool display of shade-loving plants
from Paradise Centre, Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk.
The nursery is new to me, but one of its groupings seemed more like paradise
than those from the Tory press. We do not often see superb Haberleas in a
full display of pale lilac flower among Shooting Stars, or Dodecatheon, with
tall stems, evidently grown outdoors.
Indeed, the proprietress assured me that she had dug up some of the star
turns from her own garden a day or two before.
The accompanying publicity refers to 'harmonious birdsong, the gentle
scurrying of squirrels and nearby paddocks with unusual African pygmy
goats.' Nonetheless, these rare woodland plants seem to like it.
My personal high spots were threefold. One was the very knowing show-person
on an expert stand of alpine plants who pointed out the saxifrages growing
happily in bits of tufa rock.
High spot number two was the marvellous stand from Notcutts, once again the
best of the big exhibitors of trees, shrubs and climbers.
It arranges its lilacs so prettily and, in my mind's eye, I still see the
arch of climbing plants on which Notcutts designers excel themselves. This
year, it was clothed in wisteria, Yellow Rose Emily Gray and a wonderfully
variegated honeysuckle called Harlequin which I will rush out and buy.
Flowers, however, are not everything. For plain quality, my final high spot
was the stand from Goldbrook, at Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk. Since 1988, its hostas
have won gold medals and the owner, Sandra Bond, has emerged as the nursery
trade's queen of this family. Hostas and their huge leaves are wonderful
plants for exhibition when they revive and glisten at the touch of a hose.
So many new varieties have been bred in Britain, America and Japan that we
all need time to digest them and see them at maturity. Sandra Bond's display
refutes the critics who wonder if new means better. The best are not cheap,
but I could not resist the enormous leaves of one called Sum and Substance,
which is not over-priced at Pounds 9.
Somehow, my feet seemed to have survived Chelsea's crowds after all and my
vision is no more peculiar than usual: for me, this year, H T will stand not
for horticultural therapy but for an extravagant Hosta Treat.

THIS WEEK, it has been the Chelsea flower show. I was all prepared for a
happy Monday among the plantpersons when the Weekend FT asked if I would
look at the show through the eyes of the very rich, in line with this
weekend's theme.
Fortunately, the paper arranged a ticket for one of its friends among the
recently rich. Gerry Next-Ratner is not yet a famous gardener, but he is a
king of bargain-basement shoppers who has turned his million into three
more. He wants to get into gardening, not least to maintain peace with the
lady in his life, so we met at the Chelsea Hospital entrance.
How could a millionaire resist the main tent on the Monday morning when
nobody else is supposed to be there except the press and their girlfriends?
Gerry certainly liked the tent: so much, in fact, that he interrupted a
group of judges and asked how he could hire it. He said it had the right
scale for the mid-summer frolic that he and his lady were giving near
Newbury on the evening after Wimbledon.
The members of the Floral B committee were surprised by the question. Gerry
was even more surprised by most of the flowers. It was probably a mistake to
start him off in Avenue G, the heartland of this year's civility, among the
soft colours of Four Seasons Nursery and the apparently artless arrangements
of Glebe Cottage.
Bargain-basement millionaires like quick results in quantity, and Gerry
first came alive among the newish Princess lilies which he recognised from
the florist outside his London office. He astonished Peter Smith of
Chanctonbury, in Sussex, by ordering half a borderful at Pounds 5 a plant.
I happened to remark that he would soon be rivalling Elton John, who is one
of the biggest buyers of the show lupins which the two brothers Woodfield
exhibit so handsomely at Chelsea. Gerry made straight for the stand and
ordered enough of the cream-flowered Deborah Woodfield and brick-red
Trooping the Colour to fill the rest of his border in one sweep. He was even
keener when he discovered that the brothers were avid FT followers who were
willing to swap tips as well as seed packets.
I felt I had to suggest that lupins and alstroemerias might look too
riotous. What is so wrong with a riot? Gerry answered. But if you think it
flashy, we can tone it down with a nice bit of foliage.
Not far from the lupins, we found Goldbrook Plants selling juicy hostas at a
size and price which makes a millionaire show off and order 100. When I
suggested that lady gardeners also like flowers with scent, he did a deal on
two dozen of the eleagnus Quicksilver (which Goldbrook had combined cleverly
with the hostas) and then added 20 of Notcutts' dusky lilac Congo because
the colour reminded him of a former girlfriend.
I felt I had to steer him towards David Austin and persuade him to buy up
remaining stocks of the pink-flowered FT Centenary rose because its flowers
are so much bigger than anyone else's. Before temptation flagged, we came to
rest at Blom's tulips. Every year, the Blom stand is bait for millionaires.
In their first year, but perhaps not their second, these highly expensive
tulips are certain to look their best. Gerry majored on the red and white
striped Marilyn, and then announced that he had covered every season except
autumn when he and his lady were, anyway, on Cap d'Antibes. Before I could
say Corydalis flexuoas, millionaire's restlessness had taken over. Gerry had
what he wanted and so the main tent had had it, too.
You remember, perhaps, the famous words of LB Johnson about the relative
merits of men inside the tent and men outside. At Chelsea, millionaires are
outside-the-tent people, not in. Outdoors in the sunlight, everything costs
several hundred times more.
I tried to convince Gerry that the prettiest planting and design was to be
found in this year's garden from the Daily Mirror, complete with its own
reflecting mirror and a scheme of pink, white and pale flowers from a
talented designer named John Plummer. But Gerry is not too keen on the
Mirror's politics, any more than on the new disease of outdoor gardens at
Chelsea for the 1990s. Gardens for children with learning disabilities turn
up among gardens to help the aged or gardens for people with breathing
problems. Gerry thought they were all ridiculously middle class:
horticultural correctness is not his scene.
By the main tent, he was put at ease by a timber-framed glass room with
green-grey paint and a wooden veranda. Every year, Amdega sells its
showpiece; this year, Gerry scooped the conservatory for a mere Pounds
30,000 with VAT, blinds and flooring as extras. On a crest of the wave, he
then made free with the stone garden statuary from Crowthers with planting
by Rosemary Verey.
Gerry's sights had now set themselves high. Down on the embankment, he had
caught the glint of gold in the sunlight, and it was only with great
difficulty that I dissuaded him from ordering an entire truckful of the
gold-coated pebbles and waterfalls crafted by Numoul with the help of
acrylic paint.
Further down the embankment, the competitive spirit re-surfaced. Harpers and
Queen had a huge garden of cliff-like appearance, planted beautifully with
white martagon lilies and some hybrid hellebores, which were stars of the
show. The hellebores came from the great collection of Helen Ballard near
Malvern, but her name meant much less to Gerry than the collection's new
buyer and the exhibit's backer, Lord Rothschild.
Gerry was most impressed that serious money can buy the best: he would have
been even more impressed if the exhibit's rocks had not turned out to be
made of polystyrene tinted to look like boulders. Actually, I thought they
were very clever and that their devisor, Rockscape Ltd, had found a way of
bringing a grotto within everyone's reach.
With a final flourish, Gerry spotted two enormous figures chiselled in solid
stone. What a Rothschild shows in polystyrene, a Next-Ratner orders in
granite: the antique salesperson explained that the figures were two of a
set of six, acquired recently for hard currency from the Lenin museum in
Prague.
Done, said Gerry, at a cool Pounds 29,000 and Pounds 24,000 respectively.
Millions move in a mysterious way; whatever did he want with two monoliths
of the Marxist past? 'Send them to my ex-wife,' he replied. 'She was always
ridiculously left wing until she divorced me and made off with half my
assets.'
Careful questioning of another group of judges convinced him that the
president's lunch was not open to purchase and was by invitation only.
Lovely morning, he commented, but a pity about all those fiddly little
flowers on tables inside the tent. He vanished before I could take him back
to the plantings which really matter.
Myself, I am an inside-the-tent person, but I now see why the Royal
Horticultural Society allows such staggeringly expensive extras to multiply
round the edges of the world's finest flower show. How else can millionaire
non-gardeners make up for the fact that they cannot possibly grow sweet
peas, orchids and old-fashioned roses like the ones that are grown by those
wonderfully human artists inside the tent each year?

ENOUGH of the millionaires: what do keen gardeners find they have gained
from the Chelsea flower show apart from sore feet? Every year, I use it to
build my yearly collection of catalogues from nurseries. I have never
ordered a plant on the spot but I have noted, questioned and admired. I have
tried to avoid most of the statuary and the outdoor gardens.
This year, my enthusiasms began with passion flowers and ended with
polystyrene rock. Between the passion and the plastic, there was enough to
keep me gardening all year.
The passion flowers were symptomatic of a new development and Chelsea's most
useful effect. Inside the tent, the holders of the National Collection
staged the finest exhibit of this family ever seen in Britain (these
national collections are the new life blood of Chelsea and allow us to raise
our sights by seeing so much more in families where most of us know only two
or three forms).
The credit goes to John Vanderplank at Lampley Road, Kingston Seymour, Avon
BS21 6X5. His glasshouses will receive visitors from Mondays to Saturdays
and his mailing lists of passion flowers range from Pounds 5-10 a plant,
including postage.
To my amazement, he lists more than 140 varieties, ranging from white to
scarlet; even so, he is missing more than half the known passion flowers in
the world.
There are no hardy surprises, but the half-hardy forms deserve close
attention from owners of stylish conservatories or frost-free gardens
abroad. Passion flowers will sometimes make big tangles of leaves or bear
flowers in preposterous shapes and colours, but there are varieties which
Chelsea has propelled high on my list for half-hardy cultivation.
This particular National Collection began in 1985 and is maintained by funds
from the nursery's sales. The collections are the idea of the conservation
movement and now number more than 500 throughout the UK.
Their holders have this increasing ability to change our ideas about
possible choices in well-known families, and the Royal Horticultural Society
is right to give them exhibiting space. In the past three years, my
knowledge of anything from Japanese anemones to mahonias has been deepened
by such collections on show.
At Chelsea, I was pleased to pass from the passion flowers to the erodiums,
those charming relations of the wild geraniums. They are superb plants for
carpets or edgings in dry, stony soils and I have been enjoying their
long-flowering season for more than 30 years. Suddenly, they are becoming
fashionable, although their names and hardiness are still chaotic in the
trade.
The National Collection belongs to a Dr Addyman but the exhibit at Chelsea
was staged by RV Roger of Pickering in North Yorkshire, a fine nursery which
houses the doctor's stock and knows what a cold winter means.
The other great gain at recent Chelseas has been the staging and colour
sense of the smaller nurseries. I cannot imagine why Hopleys was denied a
gold medal in its anniversary year (although I was surprised to hear
comments from the jury that Hopleys' arrangement of colour was not above
criticism). It showed a spectacular pink form of Cestrum elegans which would
excel even a passion flower in a conservatory.
For outdoors, it also had the dark Astrantia Hadspen Blood which has flowers
of such a rich, red colour; but its master stroke was a perfect plant of the
yellow-flowered wild paeony from the Caucasus, the flowers of which drop
within days of opening.
Among other smaller nurseries, I left with my first-ever list from the
Bluebell at Blackfordby, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, which is particularly
strong on good shrubs and trees. It shows and sells the variegated sweet
chestnut for only Pounds 18.95 and also lists a new garrya with wine-cloured
catkins (Pounds 9.95) and the pterostyrax (Pounds 12.95), which is one of my
particular favourites among easy trees with scented flowers.
Without the impetus of Chelsea, these small suppliers would go unnoticed.
Like the collections, the specialist exhibitors help to raise our standards.
For years, I muddled on with ordinary sweet peas and the conventional lupins
which we can all grow from a seed packet. I owe to Chelsea my awareness that
the ordinary varieties are no longer good enough and that the best are in a
different class.
The best sweet peas come from the celebrated Brackley family, from which I
buy young plants directly off the nursery at Wingrave, near Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire, in mid-spring. Its new white Ann Gregg is a wonderful foil
for the dark shades of Balmoral, proving that new peas can still be sweet
and scented.
The judges agreed on the usual gold medal, as they also agreed over the
Woodfield brothers' lupins. Here, too, their breeding has changed my notion
of the family.
Their varieties are best bought as young plants from the nursery just south
of Stratford-on-Avon and, if you keep off the greenfly, these new hybrids
light up an entire border, out-classing the weary old Russell forms.
Perhaps you would rather have a cave or cliff of monumental rock. I have
coveted one secretly for years, hollowed into a grotto and available with an
optional hermit. The trouble is that transport and siting of huge rocks is
beyond all but the most extravagent pockets, although their boldness could
do wonders for gardens in rock-free towns.
This year, a new age of rock has dawned on me. 'It is better than real - it
is super-real,' says its inventor, Rockscapes, of Mill Lane, Godalming,
Surrey (tel. 0583-426 550). The new trick involves a backing of light
polystyrene faced with a special concrete mix.
Colours and roughness can be varied artfully to match huge pseudo-builders
to a surrounding wall or nearby house. The sham rock is much lighter to
handle and lob into position: it lasts well and will not scratch or
splinter, even when waterfalls or plants are added to it.
At Chelsea, the technique was used to simulate one of the vast historic
gardens of rock laid out by the Pulham family. Elsewhere, Rockscapes has
contrived the effect of 'large-scale picturesque' for an imaginative garden
owner in Hampstead, north London.
The total cost for a romantic landscape of rocky sublimity at the bottom of
the garden would probably not exceed Pounds 2,000, but it would allow a
natural fantasy which would transform the limits of urban life.
It is a brilliant con, perpetrated in the spirit of nature. And as soon as I
can think of a sufficiently awesome fragment of alpine scenery, I will -
thanks to Chelsea - roll the new rock into place and surpass the greatest
rock gardeners of the past.

COUNT Paolo Filo Della Torre has officially opened the Season, so, English
society can proceed to enjoy itself.
Count Paolo is the London correspondent of the Rome paper La Repubblica, and
has been in the UK since time immemorial. He must be the doyen of the
foreign press corps - and possibly the only real gentleman among the lot.
Filo Della Torre was in his element on Tuesday. 'Elizabeth of England,
dressed in mauve, opened the Chelsea flower show, the most beautiful
exhibition of flowers in the world. It has been held since 1913 in May in
the park of the Royal Hospital . . . The show, together with Royal Ascot,
the garden parties of Buckingham Palace, the picnics in the garden of the
opera house of Glyndebourne in Sussex, the summer exhibition of the Royal
Academy, glorious Goodwood and the speech from the throne in the House of
Lords, provides one of the dates of the Season.'
Purists may quibble with some of this, the Queen did not exactly open the
show, but that hardly matters in Count Paolo's latest celebration of
Englishness. It was he who published the only known Guide to Margaret
Thatcher's England; where Finchley is, how to get to Grantham, and so on.
The flower show is placed in the fullest, and most elegant, context. Having
described it as 'Proustian' in atmosphere, but with no need to go 'in the
search of times past,' he continues: 'For the English from age three to 103,
flowers are an irresistible attraction. Napoleon called the British a nation
of shopkeepers, but in reality they constitute a nation of gardeners, and
the most fascinating and delicate of the women are known as an 'English
rose,' a compliment which is often directed at Lady Diana.'
It may seem surprising that the paper should devote so much space to the
Chelsea flower show but there is a good reason. Count Paolo shrewdly
included a list of Italian notables who were present at this august
gathering. Among them were Simonetta Scalferi and Carlo Caracciolo. On
investigation they turn out to be, respectively, the wife of the editor of
La Repubblica and the chairman of the board.
The delights of start of the Season are a harbinger of those of summer and
the week's fine weather brought out a rash of stories on holiday themes:
drought, the problems of timesharing and motorway madness.
In reporting the findings of the French 'Court of Accounts,' in its
investigation into the finances of the autroutes, Liberation noted the
marvellous business opportunities offered by feasibility studies for new
motorways, opportunities which only rarely involve actual construction.
In Lisieux, a series of studies had been commissioned for competing routes
for the past 20 years but no decision has been reached.
The toll system is the bane of British drivers in France but, now, they will
be able to point to the latest report as evidence of its absurdity. Thus,
Liberation notes, having once granted a concession for a toll-motorway, the
local authorities are still compelled to maintain the route nationale which
runs parallel in order to meet the obligation to provide a free service. The
result is that the whole system seems to be bust - the paper says that the
eight companies which operate it have FFr112bn (Pounds 11.3bn) of debt,
FFr1.8bn of capital and receipts stand at a mere FFr15bn annually.
Such figures might scupper British plans for private toll roads. And
revelations in El Pais could help do the same to some Spanish time-share
operations.
You may have wondered what happens when Spaniards try to sell timeshares to
each other. Not much, it seems - only 2,000 have invested in such projects.
The account in El Pais opens thus, ''Hello, I'm Pilar.' And the charming
senorita from one of those firms accompanies them into what looks like a
bingo hall where Mariles and Manolo undergo two hours of sheer oppression.'
Consumer organisations are up in arms about the system, there are no checks
on the intimidatory techniques that the writer, Angeles Espinosa, alleges
she found. The promoters, under Spanish law, are entitled to call a
timeshare apartment the 'property' of the sharers, when in fact 'it is
nothing more than right to use someone else's property.'
I had not thought of it that way before.
'Switzerland, which one had imagined buried in cosy isolation in its Alpine
treasure chest, courts the EC having allowed itself to be seduced by the
IMF. The news is no more surprising than the twist taken by the debate at
Westminster on the Maastricht treaty.
Margaret Thatcher may well shriek in her corner, the prime minister John
Major applies with total serenity the signature of his country, up to now
the least 'European' of the Twelve, to the treaty which seals the political
and economic union . . . Exit the archetype of splendid isolation . . . .'
(Patrick Sabatier, under the headline 'The end of received ideas' in
Liberation.)
James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.

LAST WEEK, I watched while horticultural punters scrambled for the latest
line in copper labels; floral prizes had already been bestowed by the jury;
as the rain intensified, we rushed for the tents and afterwards, a familiar
column of middle-aged customers headed towards the car park, lugging irises
in polythene to the boots of their Renaults and Peugeots. Yet Chelsea Flower
Show begins on Tuesday and public tickets have already sold out. Have I
beaten the crowds by telepathy? Have I dreamed in anticipation, erasing
those outdoor gardens of cedarwood designed by the Daily Express?
Next week, I will be visiting Chelsea with a cosmopolitan sense of deja vu:
I have prepared myself with a work-out at the flourishing new show in
France. Ten years ago it started at Courson, about 30 miles west of Paris
where the grounds of the Chateau had been ably gardened by three generations
of the Fustier family.
A share in the property had passed to Helene and her banking husband,
Patrice, but neither knew anything about gardening, except that it seemed to
be dreadfully expensive, especially when the main rhododendrons died of
drought in that frightful year of 1976. They approached the Association des
Parcs Botaniques de France in 1983 and proposed a flower show for members in
the Chateau's grounds. Innocently, they agreed to one nurseryman's
last-minute request that exhibitors should be allowed to sell plants.
The association was not altogether prepared for over-the-counter trading
behind the green cloth, but 200 members turned up and enjoyed the
experience. With modifications, the experiment was repeated, making
particular strides in 1986-7 and attracting valued support from Britain's
Royal Horticultural Society. It now takes place twice yearly, in May and
October, and although the Association still attends with pleasure, its
members now comprise only a fraction of the visiting public.
Last week I watched while more than 20,000 paying customers turned up during
three days to an agrarian style of car park which would reassure any
visitors to an English village fete. Tenting is limited; the staging is
vraiment rustique; exhibits are not massed or shown off a la Chelsea and
there are no restrictions on buying plants from them on the first day. The
proceeds from Chelsea go towards subsidising the RHS's other shows. Last
week Courson's proceeds went to the Societe's Bills for maintenance, a
private initiative in a country where the Societe National d'Horticulture
let the chance of a Gallic Chelsea slip during its past 150 years of sleepy
existence.
Courson is no Chelsea and my French informants assured me that they hope it
will never lose its French style. Nonetheless, some of Chelsea's own
exhibitors now cross the Channel in vans for this prelude, from Clifton
Nurseries through Blooms and Scotts to Glebe Cottage Plants. What happens
when French and English meet?
In the sunshine the French can enjoy the English and their open-air
eccentricities: mature women in macintosh jackets discourse on Alpine
plants, while the younger generation were breast feeding in track suit
trousers beside family exhibits of rare trees.
The show has a wonderful feel of informality and weekend market which has
still not been lost in its huge success. It also has the openness and
personal enthusiasm of the Fustiers and their staff who deserve to make a
proper return on a yearly investment of time, love and not less than FFr1m
(Pounds 120,000).
For me, the rencontre refutes lazy expatriates who always complain that they
cannot buy decent plants in France and that anything desirable has to be
brought from England with the accompanying problems of forms and Customs.
From June 1, plants from approved nurseries can circulate across the Channel
without further bureaucracy: my first thoughts among the rustic tables were
that England has the status of a horticultural Taiwan.
On French stands Fuchsia versicolor was selling for Pounds 18, Lavatera
Barnsley for Pounds 17 and a clematis for Pounds 20, at the exchange rate
for the debacle of Golden Wednesday. Standard box trees were on offer at up
to Pounds 400.
I am not sure which is cause and which is effect, but until the Single
Market, serious gardening from French tree and shrub nurseries has been a
minority's possibility, pre-supposing enormous riches. Even at the
herbaceous level, a common plant such as Geranium macrorrhizum from a
first-class French nursery sells for more than a plant of the new, rare and
lovely blue Corydalis flexuosa, driven over from Devon in the back of Carol
Klein's nursery van.
Beyond question, French gardening is being pulled together. For the
Fustiers, one delight of Courson is the emergence of remote nurserymen whom
the show has drawn into the open. Aimez-vous old-fashioned roses? Try
Boureau from the Ile de France which sells 500 varieties, including musk
roses as elegant standards. Best of all, try Grillot near Lyons,
'Rosieristes depuis 1829', describing itself as 'archaeologists of the rose'
across five generations which make Vita Sackville West look like a brief
comet in the sky.
Preferez-vous Meconopsis? Try the Lemonniers in Normandy, whose owners
describe to me their list of more than 25 varieties, many of which I would
never expect to find in a seaside climate. What about betilla striata or the
incredible Hebe Hulkeana? Try Dino Pellizaro down in Provence, whose list
results from 20 years' keen plant-finding and is ignored by Brits who go
south to escape the lawn.
We have all made jokes about those frightful red Salvias in the parterres of
French chateaux: the tables are now turned, if you know where to look. To my
eye, and ironic pleasure, the best sight of the show was the exhibit of
Salvias by Yves Herve and his partner at La Foux Nursery. Together, they
have collected and exhibited wild Salvias from Brazil to the Middle East,
most of which I had never seen, although the family is red-hot news in
English container-gardening. Last year, the nursery took a small display to
the Hampton Court show, but I now realise that this display was only an
appetiser. These wild Salvias, like expatriates, thrive in the hotter areas,
especially in the south.
Is there a wide and growing base for these plant lists among French
gardeners themselves? Since 1992, there have been two equivalents to our
Plant Finder, of which the better one is co-authored by Anita Pereire and
published by Hachette. Like the new open frontier with British nurseries,
these lists will raise the public's awareness of the possible. Scotts of
Somerset is already supplying wholesale to big Parisian garden stores,
including Cedre Rouge.
In the last three years, we have passed the point when the French were best
left to accessories and their most stylish jardins were imaginaire. On the
Wells and Winter accessories stand the presiding presence of Sir John Wells
told me that on two days, takings already compared favourably with his
entire haul from Chelsea.
Fifteen thousand garden labels had been bought, and French good taste
preferred green labels to white ones. As yet, clients have not graduated to
sophisticated needs like his caps for plant-stakes to blunt them and avoid
eye injuries. French customers, he found, were much more decisive, unlike
those little old ladies at Chelsea who fiddle around among his flower prints
and end up buying nothing.
Ten years ago, the Fustiers never dreamed they would have a show whose jury
included the top names in European gardening and which pulled in 20,000
visitors. In 1992, the RHS awarded a Veitch Memorial Medal to Patrice
Fustier which he would be the first to share with his wife and fellow
pioneer from a position of ignorance in 1983.
For gardeners in France the show catalogue is an essential index and a visit
in May or October will transform attentive minds' ideas of their scope and
supply. In the shadow of Chelsea, English gardeners would probably prefer to
stay put, although curiosity is rewarded and a visit can be combined with a
leap into early summer in the enchanted grounds of Paris's great haven, the
gardens at Bagatelle. All of us must wish the Fustiers continuing luck with
the weather.
During 10 dry years, their Courson show first revealed what French sources
were growing in modest isolation: the English invaders will merely serve to
enlarge it. Was it true, I asked Patrice Fustier, that two nursery persons
had met at Courson, fallen in love and married? Perhaps, he replied, and if
so, we will be exhibiting the hybrids soon at Courson too. As you follow the
flow signs in Chelsea's matchless Main Tent, you may find it hard to imagine
that in the scrimmage of this Flower Show, anyone has ever had time for
romance.

AS EVERY regular visitor to the Chelsea Flower Show knows, it is the people
who matter quite as much as the plants they exhibit.
There stand the men and women who know the answers - whether daffodil-leaves
should be tied in a knot, why your auriculas never germinated, why last
summer's tomatoes had black blotches. At other flower-shows, exhibitors are
too busy selling stuff to answer questions. At Chelsea, you fix the poor
devils with a gimlet eye and they have no place to hide.
Exhibitors have ways of evading interrogation. They spend a lot of time
fussing around the stand, squirting the roses and replenishing catalogues.
Language, too, can be a problem. Last year, my most urgent question was
about tulip fire. Does it persist in the soil? But the tulip-exhibitors were
dour Dutchmen and as soon as I waylaid them, each became resolutely
monoglot.
This year, I would find an answer. A section of the Great Marquee is
virtually a clinic for gardeners' problems. The Educational and Science
section is not glamorous; many exhibits are merely display panels and a few
plants. Nonetheless, knowing gardeners queue up for advice, often with bags
and matchboxes of unsavoury items.
For sick lawns, there is the Institute of Groundsmanship (0903-312511);
environmentally friendly ways with greenfly, the Henry Doubleday Research
Association (0203-303517); tree-problems, the Arboricultural Association;
(0794-68717). A sign of the times, the Metropolitan Police will be advising
on chaining down your statues and yuccas.
Among the agony aunts will be Dr Roland Fox of the School of Plant Sciences
at Reading University, known worldwide for its horticultural expertise. This
year's melancholy display, 'Diseases in the Garden', is also advertising
Reading's new BSc degree in crop protection as well as short courses on the
diagnosis of plant disease (0734-318708).
The exhibit itself is not about curing diseases but the symptoms which
reveal that 'the invisible worm' is in the bed. Ghastly photographs
illustrate scabs, lesions, cankers, blights, and moulds, all symptoms of
what the experts call necrosis and we call a dead plant. A close up of
carrot with black bodies, Sclerotimia sclerotorum, is as nasty as it sounds.
The vocabulary of the plant pathologist is strangely poetic. Fungi and
bacteria reveal themselves by streaks, stripes, fire, scald, scorch,
die-back, blotches, mummification, exuding, and bleeding. You want to know
what happens when your pears get scab? 'Conidia of the fungus form under the
cuticles then burst through to sporulate.' If the leaves of a plant grow
downwards, it has epinasty due to ethylene caused by wilts or canker.
Scabby potatoes and crooked cactuses will make this Chelsea's first exhibit
of (knowingly) diseased plants. However, some of these plants are valued for
their viruses. If it were not for arabis mosaic virus which dwarfs its
hosts, all kitchen-garden rhubarb would loom 6 ft tall.
The netted gold leaves on the honeysuckle, Lonicera japonica var
aureoreticulata, are due to a virus. It is not readily transmissible, which
is why the variegated form is tricky to propagate.
Virus has caused the variegations on clover, geraniums, abutilon, and a fine
golden-veined canna peculiar to Reading's collection. A silver variegated
pot of that awful pest, Mind Your Own Business, may have virus but could be
genetic.
If this sounds a trifle academic, the Reading team will be there to answer
questions. Why does my almond have Peach Leaf Curl despite being sprayed?
Answer, because England is cold, and Bordeaux Mixture is not half as
effective as lime sulphur which is listed in my old gardening books, but can
be the devil to find.
Dr Fox is used to gardeners weeping as they describe sudden death of trees
and shrubs. Often, honey fungus is often the cause. Disease, it is well
known, is a matter of social class and as Fox puts it, 'honey fungus is the
major disease of RHS members.' Look for white rot, like very old
matchsticks, and for black 'bootlaces'.
However, the good news is that the Reading team have found a 'very
effective' preventative for honey fungus which it is developing for the
market with Zeneca. Fox will not be drawn on the date of release, but it
should be with us in the next few years.

THE SKY has been as blue as the best delphiniums; the cut-price pottery is
out in force; and today and tomorrow, starting at 10 am, you can combine two
of England's favourite weekend pastimes by trying to head for the Hampton
Court flower show.
This event is in only its fourth year but already it is a popular hit and,
if you can reach it, it allows you to look at flowers and shop
simultaneously. But shopping and flower-gazing depend on two major hazards:
the M25 and British Rail's Network SouthEast. On press day, I escaped both,
but I must warn you that the overflow car parks were well filled all down
the Twickenham road.
For the first time, the show has come under the management of the Royal
Horticultural Society. So have the prices: entry costs Pounds 14 an adult
and Pounds 7 a child between five and 15. An average family must allow
Pounds 42 for entrance with another Pounds 6 for the car park - or at least
Pounds 20 for the journey on British Rail from central London.
There is also a champagne tent to negotiate. It all made me wonder: by the
time He had bought a new accessory and She had bought something in straw
from the craft village, how were the vendors of good garden plants in the
main marquees going to sell anything in quantity.
I soon stopped wondering. Since Wednesday, active planters have been
scrambling to hand over fivers for clematis from such exhibitors as the
Valley Nurseries, Lincoln, or perennials from Hardy's Cottage Plants,
Hampshire.
Like the show itself, Hardy's is a recent arrival which I noted at Chelsea.
Its space there was limited by the RHS committee, but Hampton Court has
given it room to spread. It is showing anything from white verbascums to the
best white-and-red spotted phlox called Omega and a catmint (its idea but
not quite mine) of Nepeta Six Hills Giant. The planty people are loving it -
after all, there are not so many exhibits based on gardening rather than
florestry.
Hampton Court is certainly no Chelsea; nor should it ever become one. Where
plants are shown, there are fewer, and the staging has none of Chelsea's
scale or massive impression. The atmosphere is more like a county show with
country extras. The supreme difference is that almost anything is for sale
at Hampton Court.
As I look round my garden this weekend, I realise what good things have come
back to it from the past two Hampton Courts. Everything is pot-grown and
will transplant easily as soon as it rains: the great advantage is that you
can see it and buy it on the spot.
Nonetheless, this is England and gardening is part of the countryside. At a
summer show, the countryside means heritage and, in this, the English have
no rivals at enlarging the definition. At an English summer horse show, you
can buy sheepskin coats, fudge, Range Rovers, barbecues and almost anything
except a horse. A few people watch the dressage but many more want the right
sort of quilted under-garments.
At Hampton Court, a few people may share my interest in the fine erodiums
from the NCCPG collection - but many more want pots from Spain, mohair
fashion knitware, and the right sort of hat from Tony Conner, of Eton. He
sells 'Hats for the Gentry'; his 'Old Etonian' is a straw number from
Ecuador.
Without the shopping, I am not sure I would enjoy it enough to spend a day
with the crowds. The best value among the cheap pottery seemed to me to be
Earlfarm in section C17: you can almost recoup the cost of the entry ticket
on the difference between its oriental pots and those in retail shops.
If price is no object, head for the conservatories where there is something
to suit almost nobody's pocket. One corner of the showground is dominated by
a huge, Gothic conservatory, custom-made by the staff at Oak Leaf, of York
(tel. 0904-690 401).
The kind young man with the press kit explained that the cost price - not
the retail - was Pounds 100,000 complete with blinds, tiled flooring from
Paris, ceramics at Pounds 60 a metre and curved glass. The price, however,
was merely for the record as the entire thing had been pre-sold.
Next door, Amdega of Darlington (0325-468 522) can do you a simpler model
for Pounds 30,000 - excluding blinds, flooring and installation. I think I
prefer it to the Gothic - but did not the two exhibits look familiar? Their
exhibitors confessed that both had been given a pre-run at Chelsea, where
Oak Leaf had found its buyer.
Gardeners who look at glasshouses should not be the people to throw stones;
but while you cope with the success of Hampton Court, and negotiate stalls
with names like Doughcraft, remember that among the knitwear with floral
influence and the hand-painted buttons, there will be at least one hefty
buyer at work.

THIS weekend the Chelsea flower show enters the last days of preparation in
readiness for the judges, visits by Royalty and the special charity preview
on Monday, May 18. The show is an astonishing success story; exhibitors are
just as eager to get a place in the show as the public is to see it.
Tuesday and Wednesday, from 8am until 8pm, and Thursday from 8am until
3.30pm, are reserved this year for members of the Royal Horticultural
Society. Only Thursday, from 3.30pm to 8pm, and Friday, from 8am until 5pm,
are available for non-members.
All tickets for the charity preview were sold a long time ago, and other
bookings are so advanced that the only sensible advice for anyone who still
hopes to see the show, but has no ticket, is to ring the credit-card booking
number (tel:081-900-1919) and find out what is still available.
The show's catalogue reads like a Who's Who of all the famous names in
commercial horticulture. Indications are that 1992 is to be a vintage year.
Whether interest centres on the open-air gardens or in the floral displays
packed in the great three-and-a-half-acre marquee - said to be the biggest
tent of its kind in the world - or in the close-packed exhibits of glass
houses, garden furniture, ornaments, machinery and sundries which line
avenues and fill odd places, this is a show which needs all the time that
can be given to it - and will still leave much undiscovered.
Among outdoor gardens is the large rockscape made by David Stevens for B &amp;
Q, the do-it-yourself chain, which is constructed using a beautiful
grey-blue quartzite rock in a natural way. Quartzite is an environmentally
friendly rock, the quarrying of which does not harm any ecological
situation. Stephens has used it cleverly in a landscape complete with
crofter's cottage, stream, cascades, pool and a variety of flowering and
foliage plants.
Different in style and purpose are two small gardens made by Faith and
Geoffrey Whitten, entitled Moving Home, and Moving Garden. As the names
imply, these suggest a sequence of gardens for a young couple moving up in
the world. Free use is made of container plants, to make the transfer from
one garden to another easy and inexpensive.
Elizabeth Banks Associates has gone in for sheer fantasy in what it calls a
Paradise Garden, with five gazebos, numerous rills of water and a Turkish
tent, which are said to represent the exoticism of Persia.
Gillian Temple Associates has made a roof garden for Fisons, the
fertilisers-to-pharmaceuticals group. A large number of features have been
included, such as raised timber beds, glazed pots, sculpture, a water
feature, a kitchen garden, a cut-flower area and a conservatory. Full marks
for ingenuity but probably none for restfulness.
More practical is the urban oasis designed by David Pearson for Yardley,
suitable for the back garden of a terraced house with provision for outdoor
living. It has raised beds, turf walls, arches, and space has been found for
salad vegetables, flowers and herbs. Rosemary Verey describes her design as
suitable for a London garden, but it would equally suit any small garden
surrounded by other buildings.
The staff and inmates of Leyhill Open Prison are back - this year with a
garden planned around a mulberry tree. It has an historical theme:
pre-Victorian to the left; Victorian to the top right; modern in front.
Judging by Leyhill's past efforts this should be an interesting exhibit.
The students of Merrist Wood College can always be expected to do something
original, and this year they have made what they call a hillside chalet
garden: a wildflower meadow and a chalet verandah spilling over with
colourful pelagoniums. It is a simple study in contrasts.
Pershore College of Horticulture is also a regular source of original
design. This year its students are making a garden which represents a
disused industrial site. Plants grow in cracks in the walls and various
man-made features worn away by water are included, but the focal point is a
derelict pump house and slate column split by gushing water. This is a essay
in ingenuity but not, perhaps, one meant to be copied.
Nor, probably, is the Uzbek Source Garden, made in the face of great
logistical difficulties by Ravil Abdullin from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to
represent the extremes of soil and climate in that part of central Asia. It
includes features from the immense desert regions to those of the more
fertile environments of meadows and thickets and it also finds space for the
flora of the mountain ranges.
The main marquee will be packed with exhibits from the large and spectacular
to the small but fascinating. Hillier Nurseries says it is including in its
exhibit of trees, shrubs, roses and herbaceous perennials the largest tree
ever shown in the Chelsea marquee: an English oak, 8m high, and an essential
part of the traditional English garden.
Trees are also an important feature in the Notcutts Nurseries Exhibits - '40
trees for 40 years' it says, to represent the years of the Queen's reign.
But no doubt, if all goes well over the weekend, Notcutts will not stop at
this number. It has an interesting range of trees, some in cool storage to
hold them back, others in greenhouses to hurry them along, some just
naturally ready. One that seems certain to be there is an unusual, small
growing, pink-flowered mountain ash named Sorbus hostii.
Three Counties nurseries is making a spectacular display of garden pinks
aided by Dartington Crystal, the glass manufacturer, which has provided
about 100 special crystal vases and bowls for the blooms. Stephen Bailey is
also showing an extensive selection of pinks and carnations containing a
number of new varieties. There will also be some of the latest hybrid
alstroemerias creating so much interest.
Numerous rose exhibits are included, some shown in the traditional way, as
cut flowers, some as naturally growing plants which, although a less
spectacular type of display, always seems more interesting and revealing.
David Austin Roses is an exhibitor showing growing plants flanking a central
path and covering two walls. (Look out for some fine shrub varieties of the
type Austin calls English Roses.)
Mattock's Roses are including plenty of perpetual flowering ground cover
roses. Cants is to have a spectacular display of cut flowers, and the
exhibits from Peter Beales Roses is based on a new dictionary of roses
resulting from the combination of two earlier books written by Beale, one
called Classic Roses, and the other 20th Century Roses. The new book, Roses,
is lavishly illustrated and the exhibit highlights some of its features.
Bulbous plants are numerous and varied, from the many small species - the
speciality of companies such as Broadleigh Gardens and Avon bulbs - to the
great spectaculars of Walter Blom and Son and Van Tubergen, which this year
is including a new red, pink and greenish white hippeastrum, rather
unattractively named Spotty.
Someone always seems to hold back a good display of daffodils for Chelsea;
this year it has been done by J Walkers Bulbs. It says it will replace much
of the exhibit halfway through the week, so it will be as impressive on the
Friday as for the Monday judging.
Stapeley Water Gardens is making a water-lily pool with a Monet-style bridge
to celebrate its acquisition of Latour-Marliac, the water-lily specialist in
the South of France, where many of the best new varieties have been raised.
Cannington College holds the National Collections of argyranthemums and
osteospermums. It is making an exceptionally fine exhibit of these South
African daisies, and has itself raised some of the varieties.
Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries, from Cornwall, is bringing many rare and
some slightly tender trees and shrubs to the Chelsea show, as well as a big
collection of hybrid lilies, mainly of the popular groups known as Mid
Century and Oriental.
Some spectacular exhibits have come from overseas. These include one from
the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens in South Africa, which not only shows
beautiful proteas, but also several succulents being shown for the first
time.
Machines, tools, garden sundries and buildings of many kinds, as well as an
enormous array of ornaments and garden furniture are being shown at Chelsea
once again, in bewildering number and variety.
Some of the statues are above average in quality, but for sheer enterprise
pride of place must go to Oak Leaf Conservatories. This company, engaged to
restore the dome of a magnificent Victorian conservatory at Broughton Hall,
proceeded to dismantle it, brought it to its workshops for repair, and has
now re-erected it temporarily at Chelsea before returning it to Yorkshire,
where it belongs.

I HAVE just heard the last bell of the season; from now until the early
crocuses, London's flower shows will be hibernating. Their year ended with a
memorable burst of colour. But it emphasised, once again, that keen
gardeners miss most of the possibilities if they go only to the Chelsea show
and miss its lesser relations.
When the signal sounded, the exhibitors scrambled to pull their stands to
bits. Ladies with small shopping bags made off with the last of the cut
flowers and nurserypersons dragged their exhibits out of the peat and
hustled them off to the Transit van. It all reminded me of end of term at a
boarding school. During the term, nonetheless, the British lead the world in
staging a flower show. And over the past fortnight, we have all enjoyed the
most spectacular autumn colour for a decade. The evening greyness was
gathering round Westminster but, inside the Royal Horticultural Society
hall, you could only wonder why our gardens have started to look dreary.
There was more to the occasion than Korean chrysanthemums and cotoneasters
with red berries. There were blue Chinese gentians, hardy winter cyclamen
from Cos, pink Kaffir lilies, and the brilliant red leaves on azalea Nancy
Waterer. Shows raise our notions of the possible; the weather and whitefly
do otheir best to dash them. My winter ambitions have been rising as the sap
has been falling: this final fling at a flower show has given them a new
impetus.
In November, many front gardens have seen the light already, but the shining
example for the rest of us is the family of winter-flowering viburnums. We
all know the tall, white pink forms but I am always on the look-out for the
small Viburnum farreri namum because it is only 3 ft high. It would be
excellent in a front garden or a confined space in the town if only it was
predictable.
Sometimes, this lovely Chinese shrub is covered in scented white flowers; at
others, it is nothing but leaves. I have now found the answer: apparently,
there are two forms of this small shrub in the trade and one of them is
shy-flowering. You discover the facts behind the news if you ask questions
at shows: I asked Starborough Nurseries, Marsh Green, Edenbridge, Kent,
which has seen both forms but lists only the performing one at Pounds 6.80
each.
Starborough also tantalised me with its liquidambars. These trees are much
on keen gardeners' minds because they have just finished colouring
beautifully. They have fingered leaves, like maples, and the best of the
well-known forms grow to a manageable width and turn to an unusually deep
shade of brown-red. I would always want one in a small area of rough grass
or natural shrubbery, but there are problems. Sometimes, the plants do not
colour properly, and many people say that they will grow only on acid soil.
Once again, I have better information. The colour is much more reliable if
you buy a correctly named form. Starborough sells the true deep red-brown
Worplesdon, whereas other nurseries may sometimes be supplying seedlings of
unproven merit instead. On a lime soil, there is still hope for some of us.
We should dig out a square hole about 3 ft wide and deep and fill it with
lime-free compost. Liquidambars will establish themselves in this lair and
will then tolerate a lower layer of lime or chalk.
I wait to see if this treatment will suit some of the newly-found and
unfamiliar species which Starborough is about to distribute. Two varieties,
acalycina and formosa, are trees with a promising future and planners of
collections and arboretums should check them out as soon as possible.
Acers turned up in their usual quantity from Mallet Court Nurseries, and one
of the main displays of semi-hardy chrysanthemums came from Home Meadows
Nursery. Among their bright leaves and colours, though, my eye kept lighting
instead on evergreeen skimmias. These plants will certainly grow on lime,
although not so luxuriantly as on lime-free soil. They are winners in
semi-shade, along drives or in spaces which link a house to its garden. They
also thrive in towns.
Not that skimmias had everything their own way. Wild gladioli soon drew the
attention away from their muted white; Carol Klein had plants of the
newly-found Corydalis flexuosa in full china-blue flower. We all made a
bee-line for her hardy pink chrysanthemums when the bell rang, and I added
in a rusty-brown one with small button flowers called Dr Tom Parr. Seeing is
believing with these unusually-named varieties of familiar families: a show
is the moment to decide, especially while most of the public are queuing to
dismantle the more over-sized Korean varieties which will not survive a cold
or wet winter outdoors.
The British may know how to run the best show - but they also know how to
dismantle it in 20 minutes flat. I left into the grey, high-rise concrete of
London's Victoria wondering if it had really been true - a haze of
late-berrying sorbus and pink-flowered lilies in the dark twilight of the
year. At the bus stop, somebody bumped into my newly-bought schizostylis and
bent its last flower buds. The evidence was there in my hand, although
looking rather more battered than it had only half an hour before.

MARCH 26 has been set as the date when Chelsea Football Club should complete
the Pounds 22.85m purchase of its west London ground from a subsidiary of
Cabra Estates, the heavily indebted property company.
The date has been agreed by both sides, but Chelsea has described this as a
matter of routine and plans to appeal against the recently imposed High
Court order to complete the purchase.
'Hopefully by the end of the week we will apply for a stay of the order to
pay Pounds 23m,' said Mr Peter Taylor of Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens, the
club's solicitors.
Chelsea is continuing to pursue a claim for damages against the vendor. Its
aim is to get a damages award set against the purchase price. Last week's
judgment was not favourable to this line of argument and Chelsea also
intends to take this claim to appeal.
Cabra, which last week announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.3m for the six
months to September 30, wants to get the money in before its March 31
year-end. It would help to reduce net debt of about Pounds 52m, which is on
demand.

How can one Chelsea flower show be different from another? After 30 years,
surely we middling gardeners have seen it all before?
In fact, if you were there this week you probably saw more of it than usual
because the tickets, although limited, did not sell out in advance. If you
were not, you missed the usual acts of extravagance outside the main tent,
the perpetual threat of mud, and a marvellous range of exhibits inside which
would keep anyone going for the next few months.
Outside, horticultural bookseller Wells and Winter, of Mereworth, Maidstone,
Kent (tel: 0622-813627), was distributing lists of rabbit-proof plants, and
a diving girl in white marble had been sculpted with a trendy pair of
bathing shorts, while the theme gardens continued the new focus on
sufferers, whether blind, allergic or prison inmates.
The press proved to have pulled itself together and the Daily Express staged
a rather charming impression of a railway cottage's garden with eroding
rails, no timetable and a glimpse of what rail privatisation could mean for
a rural track.
Much the best garden, though, was the Daily Telegraph's abbey garden which
Julian Bannerman mounted with unusual flair on the difficult corner site.
For once, a theme garden was more than promotional hot air.
Bannerman assembled genuine fragments of medieval walling, pinnacles and
windows. Salisbury cathedral chipped in with lengths of superfluous
stonework, on offer to potential buyers, and I began to see a future for the
fabric of my Oxford college if the funds become much tighter. But it all
seemed like an abbey garden and, where the planting had come right on the
day, it maintained a style around 1900.
One of its best touches was the tall, white tobacco plants, but they had
come over at short notice from the Prison Service garden on the site
opposite.
HM's glasshouse director described how he and his staff grow fresh
vegetables for the major sites behind bars. When tempers rise in hot
weather, they can send in a fresh salad on demand to divert the inmates. In
the recent downpour, they could also lend bedding plants to the best of this
year's newspaper gardens.
Inside the tent, the scale and the spectacle still amaze me. I know that it
is the world's largest tent and that the aisles go on forever, from the
lupins on one side to hints for the disabled on the other. Just before
judging, it looks like a miracle as wave upon wave of flowers, stretching
further than the eye can see, await their prizes and a royal visit.
This year's stars were well commemorated. Woodfield Brothers, of Tiddington,
near Stratford-upon-Avon (0789-205618), crowned their superb display of new
lupins with a pale pinkish number called Gloria Hunniford. Peter Smith, of
Chanctonbury Nurseries, Ashington, West Sussex (0903-8 92870), is making
real progress with the size and colour of his hardy alstroemiras, and every
gardener now needs to consider them for new borders as they rise up the
social scale to the names of yet more princesses (including Elizabeth, a
superb, low-growing innovation).
The corner-piece of the S &amp; N Brackley (Wingrave, Aylesbury, Bucks
0296-681384) sweet pea exhibit was a big bowl of the latest pale pink
variety, named Kiri Te Kanawa for the 50th anniversary of the singer's birth
in New Zealand. Opera-going gardeners ought to go for this heavenly cut
flower with such an excellent scent.
Among the big set pieces, I need hardly say that the best was Notcutts
Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk (0394-383344). Notcutts is master of the
huge exhibit, and this year it excelled among some strong competition
because it seemed to know how to arrange colours, keep out horrors and avoid
kitsch.
It staged a series of separate, adjacent colour schemes in a sequence that
developed as we walked round the ropes of the stand. It took us from pale
pinks to dark purples and reds and round again to fresh whites and a final
flourish of scented philadelphus to remind us of the summer ahead.
Notcutts placed colours to such advantage that it could even get away with
two of my personal hates, the pink cherry Kanzan and yellow-variegated Acer
drummondii. In context, even these brutes acquired a certain charm; but I
wish they had never appealed to so many of our town planners.
Since the mid-1980s, the smaller exhibitors are the people who have lifted
the show to a new quality and elegance. Gone are dreary old pans of alpines
and the seasonal clematis, shown on canes against canvas.
Exhibitors are marvellously clever at moving large climbers in full flower
and re-arranging them naturally: valley clematis managed tall, white arches
of the fragile vitichella forms, while Peter Beales Roses, of Attleborough,
Norfolk (0953-454707), even contrived to show a life-like arch of the
little, pink-flowered Himalayan musk roses which will not be climbing up my
beastly old conifers, or showing any colour, until mid-July.
At the lowest level, the Alpine Garden Society put on another of those
exhibits which emphasises its standing among our specialist groups. Its
president had contributed a plant of a heavenly white oxalis, collected
personally in the Falklands; and its Himalayan poppies were the best in the
show, including the rare red as well as the huge blues and the pale lavender
form.
These poppies are a heartache to me because they hate my dry soil. But I can
grow the encrusted saxifrages; their sprays of white flowers are so
obliging, yet used so rarely by keen gardeners who want to enliven the next
two weeks.
Perhaps it was a dark, rain-laden sky but my lasting impression from this
year lay with the many shade and damp-loving plants which the smaller stands
show to such perfection. The Paradise Centre, of Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk
(0787-269449) had even brought a perfect example of the white-flowered
Japanese glaucidium, which prefers woodland and is hardly ever a visitor to
Chelsea.
The many new and large-leaved hostas at Goldbrook Plants have totally
revived my interest and fondness in the family: Londoners in shade or with
large pots should pay special attention to the list from Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk
(037975-770).
Glebe Cottage Plants, of Warkleigh, North Devon (0769-540554) had caught the
dampness of the exterior with a splendid country planting of pale flowers,
unusual polemoniums, a wide carpet of moss, a half-open little gate, and a
pair of gardening boots.
I have concentrated on the showing because Chelsea is above all a show.
Anyone who thinks that many of its exhibits are somehow being bought in from
the market at short notice is very far off the mark.
There have always been some question marks and they have had their publicity
this year. But the fact remains that the majority of the exhibitors plan
their display for months, even years, in advance and try to excel in
everything for this one occasion, even though the Royal Horticultural
Society pays them nothing and they are not allowed to sell stock during the
main duration of the display.
The exhibitors this year were requested to display notices assuring the
public that everything shown had been grown or raised in the nursery itself.
To my eye, the fact has never been in doubt, because we are all being
transported briefly to heaven by the focused efforts of the most
whole-hearted growers in this country.

Two worlds of gardening intermingle on this year's Monument Stand at
Chelsea. The Monument site in the Great Marquee is the most prestigious an
exhibitor can be given. It is large - 4,250 sq ft - so only the big players
in horticulture can afford to take it on. This year, the site has been given
to Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries from Gwennap, a village far to the west
in Cornwall.
Burncoose and Southdown was established only 12 years ago. The display,
designed by co-owner David Knuckey, is intended to be as Cornish as clotted
cream, based around the engine house of a tin mine, with a shingle beach and
rushing stream. It will be planted with species to show that although the
Cornish gardener sometimes benefits from almost sub-tropical warmth, there
can also be cruel frosts and lashing, salty winds.
About 10 articulated lorries will be needed to take this Cornish scene to
Chelsea, at a cost of Pounds 30,000. Charles Williams, Burncoose's other
owner, who is not short of connections after spending his 20s working for
merchant bank Lazards, found a City sponsor in Gerrard &amp; National.
It is like a parable of modern success. In the 1980s, a young banker senses
that the party is winding down and turns to the good life in wellingtons.
Believing gardening to be a growth stock, he goes west and joins up with a
local nurseryman. He then spots a gap in the market to sell plants by mail
order in the UK and abroad.
After 12 years, the nursery has a turnover of Pounds 650,000, 80 per cent of
it mail order, and customers in 19 countries. The apotheosis comes with a
display of Cornish nostalgia on the Monument Stand.
There is, however, more behind Burncoose than City nous. The other world on
the Monument site is gardening as it was long ago: of gentlemen amateurs
with long purses and a passion to know and grow rare plants.
Williams has a gardening pedigree which stretches back to great-grandfather
JC Williams, Liberal MP for Truro and a great name in British gardening of
the Edwardian period. JC sponsored the plant-hunters George Forrest and
Ernest Wilson, grew their discoveries and created the famous 'williamsii'
hybrid camellia.
The family seat was (and still is) Caerhays Castle, built by John Nash,
where four generations have planted and re-planted 60 acres of woodland with
rare and delicate trees and shrubs.
Julian Williams, Charles's father, is a distinguished gardener who has
carried on the Caerhays tradition of hybridising. His son teases him for
being a 'tree creeper', delighted to discuss Caerhays rarities by the hour.
Charles Williams is Cornish to the core. The huge variety of plants he
sells, often rare, speaks of a historic pedigree. For cuttings of camellias,
magnolias, rhododendrons, pieris or myrtle, he can take branches from
specimens planted by his ancestors.
There is nothing about this in the Burncoose catalogue. Perhaps it is felt
that only an elite of customers will respond to the thought of Rhododendron
lindleyana or Michelia doltsopa with that kind of family tree.
The catalogue speaks the language of the future - or so Williams hopes. In
four languages, it explains the rules for export orders and the single
European market. The rules changed in 1993 - nurseries no longer needed to
have an export certificate or inspection by a ministry official for every
order.
Williams and Knuckey were already doing the bulk of their UK business by
mail order. Selling plants by post raises complications undreamt of by
companies dealing in shirts. Williams 'factors in' the not inconsiderable
cost of dealing with customers' calls - the lonely gardener who wants to
chat, or the one seeking advice.
The problems of mail order to foreign buyers have always deterred British
nurserymen, but not Burncoose. Distant customers are determined,
knowledgeable, rich - and place large orders. Burncoose's Japanese customers
usually spend between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000 an order. It takes three
days for plants to travel from Gwennap to the Japanese customs hall.
Plants destined for Japan, Israel and the US (all good customers) have to be
bare-rooted, and the Ministry of Agriculture makes sure every trace of
Cornish earth is washed off. Plants for Australia and New Zealand have to be
defoliated, which makes the game less worthwhile.
But Europe, especially since 1993, looks a far easier and more profitable
market - as well as one which the continentals seemed ill-equipped to
exploit. Successful though the Dutch, French, and Italian horticulture
industry is, Williams discovered that their nurseries grow plants
exclusively for retailers. Plant mail order does not exist in the rest of
Europe.
Within three months, 1994's new, trilingual catalogue had produced 33 orders
with a value of Pounds 11,200. The Germans are particularly eager, while a
list strong on tender species is attractive to southern Europeans. Burncoose
has allied itself with Torsanlorenzo near Rome, a nursery which can supply
big plants at big prices; a cordyline with an 8ft girth costs Pounds 600
plus carriage.
The Monument Stand might look to visitors like Cornish nostalgia, but a lot
hangs on Burncoose's display. Large stands do not necessarily mean large
orders. Increasingly, stalwart exhibitors are beginning to ask if a stand at
Chelsea justifies the expense when they can sell their stock twice over at
the Hampton Court flower show. Burncoose has a different perspective, one
which sees the Monument Stand as a world stage.

CFAC, the former Chelsea Football and Athletic Company, was invalidly made.
The statement said that 90 per cent of CFAC's debts had already been paid
off and the remaining non-Chelsea debts were never acknowledged as valid.
Chelsea is seeking to appoint a liquidator 'who will finalise the affairs of
CFAC in the most cost-effective manner and in the best interests of all the
remaining creditors'.
