  [Text] In his new year address Turkmenistan President 
Saparmurad Niyazov said that "most wishes and aspirations" of 
the country's residents for 1993 had materialized "with the help 
of Almighty Allah." 
  "Our country has met its targets in both the political and 
economic fields. Independent Turkmenistan which chose positive 
neutrality to be the overriding principle of its foreign policy 
has established itself in the CIS and other international 
organizations as a country which follows unswervingly its own 
road and has succeeded in reducing the world tension. By its 
courageous political and economic steps Ashgabat has on numerous 
occasions been in the center of attention," Niyazov said. 
  He added that it was necessary that relations with 
neighboring Iran, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Russia 
be based on mutual respect and equality. 
  "We are pleased with establishment of a new level of 
relations with the Russian state, he emphasized. When the 
Russian president stayed in Turkmenistan we signed important 
treaties which will maintain and improve the earlier good 
relations with the great neighbor and start equal, mutually 
beneficial cooperation." 
  Niyazov described the introduction of the national currency, 
the manat, as one of major events and expressed confidence that 
the manat will consolidate in 1994. (The official rate of 
exchange is now 601 ruble per manat - IF). 
  The president also said that the government had developed a 
concept of oil and gas production in the country until the year 
2020. As its own oil and gas policy are put into effect, 
Turkmenistan "will reach the level of developed countries," he 
emphasized. 
  In Niyazov's words, Turkmenistan's armed forces "will never 
be the cause of trouble for other countries" but "will not allow 
disturbing the peace and well-being in the republic."

  [Text] Jakarta, June 3 (ANTARA) -- PT Wijaya Karya [private 
company] and its brokering company PT Prima Comexindo signed a 
trade contract here Thursday with the Government of 
Turkmenistan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS), to supply the former Soviet republic with construction 
products. 
  During the signing ceremony, which was attended by visiting 
Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov, Indonesia's 
coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security Susilo 
Sudarman and Indonesia's Ambassador to CIS countries Rachmat 
Witular, the chamber of commerce and industry from both 
countries also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to 
encourage economic relations between their entrepreneurs. 
  In his welcoming speech, President Niyazov said that the MOU 
and the trade contract constitute the basis for closer bilateral 
economic cooperation as well as an official framework for 
business activities conducted by the two countries' 
entrepreneurs. 
  He also said that Indonesia may find it attractive to invest 
in the raw material processing industry now being developed in 
Turkmenistan. 
  Turkmenistan, he explained, has oil deposits of some 13 
trillion cubic metres but huge investments are needed for 
processing and transportation. 
  Niyazov also hoped that cooperation might be established 
with 
Indonesia in developing a textile industry in view of 
Turkmenistan's annual production of one million tons of cotton 
and Indonesia's established textile industry. 
  In the meantime, general chairman of Indonesia's Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie said that the newly signed 
MOU will provide opportunities to Indonesia's and Turkmenistan's 
businessmen to develop opportunities in trade, industry and 
investment. 
  President Director of PT Prima Comexindo Hashim S. 
Jojohadikusumo meanwhile said that bilateral economic relations 
have great potential given that, at 511 thousand tons annually, 
Indonesia is the world's largest cotton importer. 
  According to Jojohadikusumo, in addition to textiles, 
cooperation in investment and trade between Indonesia and 
Turkmenistan could also be established in cement, oil and gas. 
  He added that Indonesia will likely export frying oil, tea, 
aircrafts and railway coaches to Turkmenistan.

 [Unattributed article: "Meetings in the Turkmen Land"] 
  [Text] On 27 May 1994 the President of Turkmenistan 
S. Niyazov received G. Fadeyev, chairman of the Council on Rail 
Transportation of the CIS Countries and RF Minister of 
Railways. 
  B. Sardzhayev, deputy chairman of the Turkmen Cabinet 
of Ministers, and Kh. Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State 
Railway, took part in the conversation. 
  The minister informed the President of Turkmenistan of the 
work done by the Council on Rail Transportation to coordinate 
the activities of railroads on the interstate level. 
Preservation of the technological uniformity of the rail network 
of the former USSR was noted as an important result of the 
Council's work. 
  The President of Turkmenistan had high praise for the role 
of 
the Council on Rail Transportation in supporting the transport 
of freight and passengers in the interests of the economic and 
social development of all the member states of the CIS and the 
Baltic countries. He noted the need for further consolidation of 
cooperation among railroads, in particular the railroads of the 
Russian Federation and Turkmenistan. 
  Turkmenistan is devoting a great deal of attention to the 
creation of rail transport corridors, which are important not 
only for the particular region but also for Russia and the other 
countries of the CIS. They have in mind construction of new rail 
lines from Tedzhen through Seraks to Meshkhed and from 
Gazandzhik to Gyzyletrek; these lines will provide the shortest 
route to Iran and on to the Persian Gulf for freight from 
Russia's eastern regions, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan as well as 
for international transit freight. 
  Salarmurat Niyazov stressed that the doors are open for 
mutually advantageous cooperation by all interested states in 
carrying out these projects. As for Russia, a joint working 
group has been formed on the basis of the protocol of the talks 
between the RF minister of railways and the chief of the Turkmen 
State Railway to study the set of questions related to Russian 
participation in building the above-named rail lines. As the 
result of its work, which should be completed before 1 September 
of this year, proposals will be prepared for the governments of 
Russia and Turkmenistan. 
  The support of the RF Ministry of Railways for the formative 
process and efficient operation of Turkmenistan's independent 
railway was noted as part of the development of bilateral 
Russian-Turkmen cooperation. At this meeting questions of 
improving the quality of transportation ties between Russian and 
Turkmenistan were also discussed. 
  In conclusion the President of Turkmenistan wished the 
participants of the 11th meeting of the Council on Rail 
Transportation good results and successful implementation of the 
decisions adopted in the interests of further development of 
mutually advantageous cooperation.

  [Text] President Saparmurad Niyazov's visit to Tehran was 
aimed at following up on the agreements concluded between Iran 
and Turkmenistan when President Hashemi-Rafsanjani visited that 
republic in October 1993. During his stay, President Niyazov 
visited Esfahan, [name indistinct], Shiraz, and [name 
indistinct] island and became closely acquainted with Iran's 
economic opportunities and issues. Undoubtedly, the two 
countries' economic approach and resources can improve economic 
exchanges and cooperation between them. 
  The signing of some 20 cooperation agreements between Iran 
and Turkmenistan is very important for their bilateral 
relations. With these agreements we will try to quickly remove 
the effects of the 70-year long separation. In view of this, 
the protocol the two countries signed on cooperation in the 
supply of oil and natural gas, the establishment of sea and air 
links, and exchanges of agricultural products, commodities, and 
visitors is an important document. 
  The fact that Iran and Turkmenistan share a common border 
gives us an opportunity to intensify our economic and cultural 
interaction. The common historic and cultural ties between the 
two sides may further promote their relations. 
  Meanwhile, Iran is a bridge between Turkmenistan and the 
other republics in Central Asia and with the Persian Gulf and 
the Indian Ocean. Considering the efforts of several Western 
countries following the USSR's collapse to impose their economic 
policies on the republics of Central Asia, including 
Turkmenistan, the improvement of those republics' relations with 
the regional countries, particularly the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, will be in their interest, for it will result in closer 
economic relations in which expansionist objectives have no 
place. 
  Turkmenistan has rich oil and natural gas resources. In view 
of that, it could have a special place among the republics in 
Central Asia. As for culture, Turkmenistan has been separated 
from its cultural roots as an Islamic country for more than 70 
years but it has prepared the necessary conditions to return to 
its true nature and foundations. The establishment of a network 
of cultural relations and channels between Iran and Turkmenistan 
will be one of the first steps the two countries will take in 
the future. 
  The protocol between the two countries also calls for 
exchanges of students and experts, the establishment of 
libraries, book fairs, and cultural contacts, all of which 
indicates that Tehran and Ashgabat are determined to strengthen 
their relations. 
  It must be recalled that Turkmenistan became a member of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] and other bodies 
established by the littoral countries in the Caspian Sea region 
after the USSR collapsed. As stressed by the members of those 
organizations, participation in their activities, particularly 
in economic activities, is very important. Turkmenistan's 
opportunity to export its natural gas to foreign countries 
through Iran will play an important role in its effort to 
improve its economy. Meanwhile, the linking of Turkmenistan's 
railway system with those of Iran will enable that republic to 
reach Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkey; and that will give it 
an opportunity to reach the regional and international markets. 
Undoubtedly, the establishment of links with the region and the 
other parts of the world will not only serve Turkmenistan's own 
interests but also promote cooperation for economic development 
among the regional countries.

over regional map -- recorded] 
  [Text] This morning, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was 
received by Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, who told Cetin 
that Turkmenistan is grateful to Turkey for its contributions to 
Turkmenistan's development. Niyazov pointed out that work is 
under way in connection with the natural gas pipeline, adding 
that the natural gas will arrive in Turkey within two years and 
will be used at a much cheaper rate than today. 
  Niyazov said that Turkmenistan wants to name a textile 
factory under construction in the city of Tedzhen after 
President Suleyman Demirel. 
  Foreign Minister Cetin said he is happy to see the progress 
Turkmenistan has made in two years. He pointed out that the 
brotherly relations between Turkey and Turkmenistan develop with 
each passing day, adding: Turkey will continue to extend all 
kinds of help to brotherly Turkmenistan. 
  Cetin recalled that the project to deliver natural gas from 
Turkmenistan to Europe via Turkey is being executed by a 
consortium composed of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Russia, and Iran. 
He also said that Turkish businessmen want to build a port in 
the city of (Turkmenbasi) on the Caspian Sea. 
  During the meeting, which was conducted in a very warm 
atmosphere, Cetin repeated President Demirel's invitation to 
President Niyazov to visit Turkey. Cetin presented Niyazov with 
maps of Turkmenistan printed in Turkey in the Latin and Cyrillic 
alphabets, as well as with a Turkish diplomatic passport. 
Niyazov kissed the passport and touched it to his forehead, 
saying he considers Turkey his second motherland. 
  It is reported that Niyazov's visit to Turkey will take 
place 
either in late June or early July. 
  Cetin briefly interrupted his contacts in Turkmenistan to 
visit Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. He was received at 
Tashkent Airport by Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said 
Asymov. Cetin was later received by President Islam Karimov. 
The two men discussed all aspects of the relations between the 
two countries. On behalf of President Demirel, Cetin invited 
Karimov to Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish Ambassador to Uzbekistan 
Erdogan Aytun presented his credentials to Karimov. 
  In the afternoon, delegations from the two countries, headed 
by the respective foreign ministers, held talks. Uzbek Foreign 
Minister Asymov said his country wants to further develop its 
economic and political relations with Turkey. He recalled that 
Turkey was the first country to recognize Uzbekistan and 
stressed that his people will never forget that. 
  Cetin said Turkey believes that relations between the two 
countries -- which are relatives, making them closer than 
friends -- have not developed sufficiently. He pointed out that 
the volume of trade between the two countries is $225 million. 
This should be raised to $1 billion, he stressed. 
  The foreign minister stated that Turkey extends all the 
economic aid it can to Uzbekistan. He explained that the 
$250-million loan extended by Eximbank and the $245-million 
sugar and wheat loans are being used. After concluding his 
contacts in Uzbekistan, Cetin returned to Ashgabat. 
  Tomorrow morning, Cetin will sign a consular agreement and a 
protocol on solidarity between the foreign ministries of the two 
countries. He will then return to Turkey.

  [Text] The first official round of talks between Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Mr. Saparmurad Niyazov, presidents of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkmenistan, was held on Sunday [2 
January] evening. 
  At the meeting, Mr. Niyazov thanked the officials of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran for their warm hospitality and 
explained that the aim of his trip to Iran is to benefit from 
our country's successful experiences and to find new ways for 
expanding bilateral relations in a new era of cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  The president of Turkmenistan emphasized the religious, 
cultural, and historical features shared by the two countries 
and noted that Iran is a country with an ancient history and 
civilization. He said: Turkmenistan wishes to have wider 
cultural links with the Islamic Republic of Iran. He expressed 
the hope that Turkmenistan's cultural experts will use the 
existing historical and cultural works in Iran's libraries and 
educational centers to compile that country's history. 
  Mr. Niyazov said in connection with the Ashgabat meeting: 
With the establishment of a climate of friendship and 
understanding between neighboring and regional countries, the 
growing trend of cooperation between Turkmenistan and the 
Islamic Republic of Iran will also accelerate. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, for his part, referred to the 
composition of Turkmenistan's high-ranking delegation and said 
that this delegation's trip provides a good opportunity for 
fulfilling the aims of widening relations between the two 
countries. He added: Because Iran and Turkmenistan are 
neighbors, both countries desire deep and friendly relations; 
and the visits paid by high-ranking officials of the two 
countries to Tehran and Ashgbat have been instrumental in 
serving this objective. 
  The president pointed to the existence of land and sea 
borders between the two countries in the Khorasan, Gilan, and 
Mazendaran Provinces, adding: These provinces, which have 
suitable natural and geographical features, can play a 
fundamental role in the growth of trade and economic exchanges 
between the two countries. He stressed the role of the joint 
commission between the two countries in the development of 
relations and cooperation and noted the need for the creation of 
facilities in the area of transport and travel for the purposes 
of exchanges of views and experiences between commercial and 
economic experts of Iran and Turkmenistan. 
  The talks were also attended by the two countries' ministers 
of foreign affairs, culture, commerce, post, telegraph and 
telephone, transport, and agriculture, and a number of other 
officials. It was decided at the talks that committees will be 
formed with the involvement of experts on political matters, 
transport and communications, economics, commerce, education, 
training, health, agriculture, fisheries, gas and oil, and 
culture and tourism. After discussion and debate, the committee 
experts are to convey the results to the presidents of Iran and 
Turkmenistan.
