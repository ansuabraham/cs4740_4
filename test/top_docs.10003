COLUMBUS LEFT 'REAL' INDIANS IN A BIND; 


AMERICANA: WHEN THE EXPLORER MISTOOK AMERICA FOR INDIA, HE CREATED AN IDENTITY 
PROBLEM FOR LATER ARRIVALS FROM THE ASIAN SUBCONTINENT. 




By ANKUR J. GOEL, Ankur J. Goel is a lawyer and writer in Los Angeles who 
publishes The Indo-American Statistical Sourcebook. 




I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but now that the national observance is out 
of the way, I believe it's time for us to recognize that Christopher Columbus 
was a thief. 


I don't mean that he was a thief in the normal sense, although many Native 
Americans believe he stole their land. What I mean is that he made a mistake, 
and in the process stole the name "Indian" from its rightful owners and gave it 
to the natives of the New World. 


As most of us learned in school, American Indians got that name because 
Columbus, searching for a westward route to India, landed in North America. 
Believing he had reached India, the explorer called the natives "Indians." 
Stubborn man that he was, he continued to do so even after he found out he 
hadn't reached India at all. And by that time, the name had taken hold in the 
European explorer fraternity. 


Five hundred years later, the whole world continues to use the term "Indian" to 
describe those people who lived in the Americas long before Europeans even 
dreamed of sailing west. 


Now, I know that to most Americans, Columbus' little mistake is just a tidbit 
of historical lore. I also know that for those Native Americans who were run 
off their land and massacred by European settlers, Columbus' real mistake was 
showing up on this continent in the first place. 


In the face of that, my complaint may seem, well, trivial. And I suppose it can 
be viewed that way. But that's the nature of pet peeves, isn't it? 


When I was in grade school, kids used to ask "What are you?" I always found 
this a difficult question. Were they asking me if I was a human? Were they 
asking me if I was stupid or smart? Or were they asking me why I looked 
different from them, with darker skin? 


Concluding that it was the latter, I would say, "I'm Indian." 


The next question was predictable: "What tribe?" 


"No, no," I would say, "Indian from India!" Eventually, I caught on and began 
to give that as the answer in the first place. 


Years later, when I launched a magazine for Americans of Indian heredity, I 
faced the more practical aspects of the name problem. Once, when we were 
working on a historical piece about Indians from India in the United States, I 
looked in the library card file and found a whole drawer labeled "Indians." 


"Success," I thought to myself. I selected one title that sounded promising and 
traipsed through the rows of books until I spotted the target volume. I pulled 
it down from the shelf expectantly. 


On the cover, in full color, was a picture of Chief Sitting Bull. I'd been had. 


I asked a librarian for assistance. She couldn't find what I was looking for, 
either. Choosing an identification line for the magazine was also a challenge. 
The most logical choice seemed to be "The magazine for Indian Americans." This, 
I reasoned, was the way all other ethnic groups did it. There were Polish 
Americans, Mexican Americans, Chinese Americans. Unfortunately, "Indian 
Americans" often became confused with "American Indians." 


Other Indians-from-India proposed solutions. How about "Asian Indian American?" 
A well-intentioned friend who is not Indian proposed "East Indian," not 
realizing that the East Indies are a set of islands nowhere near India. 


The clearest solution seemed to be "The magazine for Indians from India." But 
the more I thought about it, the funnier it sounded. "Indians from India." It 
was so redundant. Like "Americans from America," or "Canadians from Canada." 


I decided to get to the bottom of the problem. I would campaign to have the 
term "Indians" reserved for people from India. I thought Columbus Day would be 
a good time to begin. 


When I told a friend who is a lawyer about the proposal, she was 
unenthusiastic. "The American Indians have been using that name for 500 years," 
she argued. 


"It's like you abandoned your trademark. Anyway, the statute of limitations has 
run out. You should have done something sooner."

   By STEPHEN FIDLER


FIVE HUNDRED years after his fateful voyage to the new world changed the
shape of history, Christopher Columbus is still stirring things up. To some,
he is the daring and far-sighted navigator of legend who brought
civilisation and the Christian religion to a new world; to others, a greedy
and small-minded opportunist whose actions wreaked devastation on a
continent.
There is no agreement even on what he looked like. None of the thousands of
likenesses being produced for the coming week's celebrations of the 500th
anniversary of his first landfall in the Americas was produced in his
lifetime. Authorities cannot even agree about where he first set foot on
land.
The Columbus story is permeated by myth. The traditional image, as the
fearless explorer, was espoused by the north Americans who 100 years ago
celebrated the anniversary of his 'discovery.' At this time, the US thought
of itself unequivocally as a European society, and European self-confidence
was at its height.
From the other side, the view of Columbus as a greedy fortune-hunter often
is accompanied by the idea of pre-Columbian America as an idyllic state. In
fact, it was subject to periodic and violent upheavals, with cannibalism and
human sacrifice an important part of some societies.
The politically correct also condemn Columbus based on a set of values of
which he could not have known.
It is undeniable, however, that the term 'discovery' for Columbus's voyage
is loaded with Eurocentricity. The 57m people living in the Americas - this
is one serious estimate, but the numbers could have been much higher or
lower - were there long before Columbus tipped up. As one observer has
pointed out, it was rather like President Nixon's 'secret' bombing of
Cambodia: to a lot of Cambodians, it wasn't much of secret.
Authoritative accounts suggest Columbus was not a wonderful navigator. He
appears to have believed throughout his life that he had discovered a new
route to Asia, and his trip arose out of a miscalculation about how far it
was to Japan. It is hard to question his bravery, but his navigational feat
was modest. His second voyage in 1493 took a mere three weeks: he took the
prevailing east winds over and the westerlies back. Once you knew it was
there, it was easy.
If Columbus had not sailed, the Indian 'idyll' would undoubtedly have been
destroyed by other Spanish adventurers soon after. The Spanish monarchy was
in a desperate search for capital: after centuries of fighting, the Arabs
were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in 1492.
During the same year, Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were
ordered out. Not surprisingly, they took their money with them. Although
Columbus had touted his idea to other royal courts, only at the Spanish was
he able to make an impact.
The impact of this was to be devastating: some estimates suggest the native
population of Latin America was reduced by 90 per cent within a century.
Although the indigenous people often were treated with horrific savagery by
the new settlers, most of them died through disease.
Their pathetic revenge: syphilis. Although it existed already in Europe, the
American strain was highly virulent. The returning adventurers brought it
back and the great pox swept the continent.
Columbus and his successors over the next 30 years paved the way for the
development for the first time of the 'global' economy. With the silver dug
out by hapless indians from the mines of Spain and Mexico, Europeans paid
for the spices and other goods which were being brought from Asia. Moreover,
tobacco, potatoes and other products from the new world were to change the
habits of the European people.
The interaction of the Spanish and the various Amerindian cultures differed
from region to region, the consequences of which can still be seen. The
urban cultures of the densest population - in Mexico, and of the Andean
societies - were easier for the conquerors to force into the colonial
economy. In Brazil, however (colonised by the Portuguese), and other
regions, the semi-nomadic natives could not be made to work. As a result,
large numbers of Africans were transported to the region as slaves.
The nature of medieval Spanish society was to make a permanent mark on Latin
America. It was also to permeate the north, becoming tied up with the myth
of the wild west. Spanish cattle farming techniques of the 12th century -
such as branding, lassoing and round-ups - were taken to the plains of South
America before they migrated north.
More fundamentally, the relationship between the Spanish ruling elites in
Latin America and the Spanish monarchy reflected that which existed between
the monarch and the Spanish baronies. This gave the colonial elites great
discretion to run their affairs, and to control indigenous populations, as
they pleased.
The rulers of the newly-independent Latin nations continued this tradition
in the 19th century, viewing the Indians as a threat to their emerging
nationhood. The consequences of all this can still be seen in the sharp
racial divisions in countries such as Peru, where the ruling elite still
largely considers itself European.
Another reason why Columbus manages to arouse such high emotions, five
centuries after his voyage, is that the issues raised by the European
colonisation of the Americas, and the subsequent transport of huge numbers
of Africans to work there, have yet to be resolved.
America's poor are overwhelmingly black or Indian, and the social injustices
of the European entry to the new world have not yet been addressed.
Following a decade which has seen a growing gap between rich and poor in
North America (because of the Reagan years) and in Latin America (because of
the debt crisis), this has hit a chord.
Columbus set in train a clash of three cultures: European, Amerindian and
African. The Indians and Africans did not voluntarily become adjuncts to the
European economy: they were forced to participate and, in its name, they
suffered agonies
The collision between the Indians and Europeans was inevitable. Historian
Edwin Williamson points out that the two groups had incompatible
expectations: Spain had a monetary economy in which gold was a scarce
resource and power was determined by control over labour.
The people of the Caribbean islands first encountered by Columbus lived in a
subsistence barter economy in which gold had an ornamental role and the idea
of labour service had not developed. The difference confirmed the European
prejudice, still to be heard in Latin capitals today, that Indians are
'lazy.'
The anniversary of Columbus appears, however, through media coverage, to
have raised consciousness in many parts of the world about the lot of the
American Indian. The prospect of celebrating the event, which many view with
horror, has made the Indians themselves more conscious of their own
identity, and encouraged some to use the mechanisms of Latin America's young
democracies to assert their rights.
Five hundred years after his voyage, Columbus might have performed a belated
service for Latin America's native cultures after all.

NCC CONDEMNS COLUMBUS' 'INVASION' OF NEW WORLD 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




PITTSBURGH, Pa. 




The National Council of Churches, ending a three-day meeting here Friday, voted 
to condemn Christopher Columbus' "invasion" of the New World in 1492. 


A celebration is "not an appropriate observation of this anniversary," the 
council's governing board, representing 32 denominations with 42 million 
members, said. The resolution, approved after more than two hours of debate, 
cites "genocide, slavery, 'ecocide' and exploitation of the wealth of the land" 
as the bitter fruit inherited by "the descendants of the survivors of the . . . 
invasion." 


"The church, with few exceptions, accompanied and legitimized this 
exploitation," the council added. 


The resolution, "A Faithful Response to the 500th Anniversary of the Arrival of 
Christopher Columbus," was proposed by the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage Indian 
who teaches at the Illif School of Theology in Denver. 


"The only thing Columbus really discovered was that he was lost," Tinker said. 
"American people have so digested the myth of American history that they have 
lost sight of the truth -- the pain of so many people who live on the 
continent." 


The resolution is intended to influence next year's official yearlong 
celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of Columbus' fleet reaching the 
Caribbean islands. 


An attempt by Episcopal Bishop David Reed of Louisville, Ky., to soften the 
resolution failed. 


"Many of us find it hard to state that this is not a time for celebration," 
Reed told the 220 board members. "There have been so many things over the past 
500 years to thank God for." 


Joseph D'Andrea, the vice consul of Italy in Pittsburgh, said he understood the 
intent of the resolution but thought the anniversary should celebrate "the 
spirit of America" and its accomplishments rather than dwell on the landing's 
negative effects. 


But the church council noted that "theological justifications for destroying 
native religious beliefs while forcing conversion to European forms of 
Christianity demanded a submission from the newly converted that facilitated 
their total conquest."

AMERICAN HISTORY, A SAGA OF IMMIGRANTS 




Interesting letters on April 23 regarding Vietnamese immigrants. For instance, 
I wonder where Sal Giardino learned his American history? He never knew that 
there was no country called "Italy" in 1492? That Christopher Columbus was 
Genoese, not Italian, and that nobody on the Italian peninsula would give him a 
penny to make his famous trip? It was Spanish money, Spanish ships and Spanish 
sailors that made that trip possible, and Columbus claimed the land he found 
for the Queen of, yes, Spain! I have never understood why the Italians claim 
Columbus Day. 


Furthermore, it was the English who originally colonized our part of North 
America, and immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, Poland, 
China, Japan, Mexico, and, yes, even Italy, and on and on who settled, built, 
and are still building our beautiful country. When the first generation got 
here from any of these places they did nothing but hard work, which is exactly 
what the first generation of our new Asian immigrants is doing. 


Then there are the "garish urban-blight type buildings" Jennifer T. Moore 
complains about. Now, which of us can remember the failing businesses, sleazy 
used-car lots, trashy signs and vacant lots that lined Garden Grove and 
Westminster Boulevards before the Asians began building? And what do we have 
now? Clean, interesting, successful businesses that generate a lot of tax 
money. Personally I prefer the latter. 


I suppose as much as anything we should feel pity for people who are so 
profoundly ignorant of the country they proudly call their own. The immigrants 
who don't "succeed" are criticized for "living off our welfare system"; the 
ones that do succeed are criticized for having the nerve to actually get 
"rich." 


What a pity the grandparents of the Giardinos and Moores and others of their 
attitude aren't around to remind them of how they were treated when they came 
here "yearning to be free." What a pity that so many of us still don't 
understand what the inscription on the Statue of Liberty really means!

HOME, HOME ON THE ISLAND; 


BUFFALOES THRIVING ON SANTA CATALINA UNDER WATCHFUL EYES OF CONSERVANCY 




By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 




AVALON 




Doug Propst maneuvered his Jeep down a dry ravine through scrub oak, prickly 
pear cactus and scorched grass. One hundred yards away, dust hung in the air 
like baking powder flung skyward. 


"That's them," he exclaimed, squinting into Santa Catalina Island's shimmering, 
mid-morning light. 


As the vehicle eased over a knoll, the object of his search appeared on the 
valley floor. More than 50 large, shaggy buffaloes lounged around the foot of 
Cape Canyon Reservoir, drinking, snacking and sunning themselves -- not unlike 
the tourists on Avalon's beach 10 miles to the southeast. 




Grunted Nervously 


Chocolate brown buffalo cows, with caramel colored calves at their side, 
grunted nervously and turned their bearded faces toward the intruders. A bull, 
the size of a Volkswagen, rolled on the ground, powdering his coarse, matted 
hair with dirt -- nature's version of mosquito repellent. Bath complete, he 
pushed to his feet and emitted a belch-like snort before casually rambling up 
through the sage scrub. At the top of the rise, he stood poised against the 
azure sky. 


The fact that most people have seen such profiles only on nickels is not lost 
on Propst, who is president of the Catalina Conservancy. He has been roaming 
these back roads for more than 34 years, but speaks as enthusiastically as 
someone seeing the magnificent beasts for the first time. 


A former Montana rancher, he was hired to run the Santa Catalina Island Co.'s 
cattle ranch. But the cattle were soon phased out, and he found himself 
caretaker of the island and one of the largest herds of bison in the country 
outside of such refuges as Yellowstone National Park and the National Bison 
Range in Montana. 




Less Than a Thousand 


The bison count nationally, which numbered an estimated 60 million in the 
1800s, dwindled to less than a thousand at the turn of the century as hunters 
shot the animals for their hides and meat. Whole carcasses were left across the 
plains as hunters took only the gourmet delicacy of the day, buffalo tongue. 
Still others were slaughtered for sport. 


Bison protection laws were enacted in 1907. Since then, the numbers have 
increased to about 80,000, according to the American Bison Assn. Of these, 
about 1,500 are found in California, most of those on ranches in the southern 
part of the state. 


But on Catalina, the buffaloes, first by circumstances and then by ambitious 
conservation efforts, have been given refuge. 


As is often the case with non-natives who move to California, the first 
buffaloes arrived on Catalina to become movie stars. Approximately a dozen 
animals were shipped in for cameo appearances in the 1924 silent film, "The 
Vanishing American." 


A few years later, a few more were brought in from their traditional Great 
Plains home to strengthen the island herd. Today, the buffaloes still get top 
billing in the Catalina Conservancy's extensive preservation program. 


Since 1919, the 21-mile-long island has been owned by the family of chewing gum 
magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the Catalina Island Co. In 1975, the 
company deeded more than 86% of the island, or about 42,000 acres, to the 
nonprofit, private conservancy to preserve and restore the island's plants and 
animals and control recreation use. Financing for the programs comes mostly 
from a stock portfolio donated by the Wrigley family and private donations. 


Much of the wildlife was introduced to the island by settlers and later by 
state game officials. 


As Propst drove through rugged Cape Canyon on a recent morning, animals 
nonchalantly showed themselves. A black and white feral pig and her piglet 
trotted up a hillside, a wild turkey ambled through a small grove of red barked 
manzanita and swallows dived onto ponds to scoop up bugs. 


It is rutting season, and the buffaloes are gathered near ponds and streams in 
larger herds, sometimes as many as 100 cows, yearlings and calves band under 
the watchful eyes of bulls who have won the harem. At one watering hole, a 
large bull with ribs showing lumbered by. Usually weighing about two tons, the 
bulls often lose two or three hundred pounds this time of year. 




Pushed From Herd 


Here and there, solitary old bulls will be seen, pushed out of the herd by the 
younger bulls. "See that old guy. He's been in a lot of wars," Propst said, 
pointing out a rangy animal with one horn broken off and the other chipped. 


Some live to be more than 30 years old. 


At Middle Ranch, the conservancy's working ranch, dozens of young buffaloes are 
lured into corrals each year and shipped to ranchers for breeding stock. 
Without such measures, the island would be overrun. 


The conservancy staff does no hands-on work with the buffaloes unless there is 
an emergency. Herding them is out of the question. 


"You can drive cattle where you want to go. And you can drive buffaloes where 
they want to go," Propst said. 


He recalled one bull that the staff tried to snare in hopes of removing a long 
strand of wire tangled around his leg. 


"We tried to herd the bull through the brush where one of our men, a good 
roper, was hiding in bushes on horseback. Well that animal got one sniff of 
what was awaiting and took off -- buffaloes can make horses look like they are 
tied to the ground -- we never saw him again."

AS the song has it: 'They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said
the world was round. . . They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when
they said that man could fly'. There are very few laughs in Richard Nelson's
play Columbus at the Barbican. Very few thrills either. Nothing indeed but
encircling gloom, which lasts for 3 1/2 hours. Has the Royal Shakespeare
Company really thought about what it is doing?
Nelson is an American playwright who has written for the RSC before. Some
people will remember his Two Shakespearean Actors. His Columbus, performed
on the main Barbican stage, is a disaster. We should be clear why.
No one is going reasonably to object about whether his version is
historically accurate. After all, there is poetic licence. The only test is
whether it stands up as a play. I can think of no single criterion on which
it does - certainly not on this stage and at this length.
The Nelson thesis is that Columbus was a snob and a creep. Possibly he was,
though it would help to explore the theme, not just proclaim it. This
Columbus is first seen getting out of bed with his mistress who appears
washing her legs.
As Columbus is promoted in the hierarchy, he drops the mistress because, he
says, it would not do for a member of the nobility to consort with a
peasant. His characterisation as totally obnoxious continues throughout.
Columbus is nasty to anyone who ever helped him.
There are no compensations. The language is appallingly stilted. When
Columbus says he is the Admiral of the Ocean Sea, he might as well be
mimicking a line from Gilbert and Sullivan about the Queen's Navee. There is
a sequence about a pornographic dream which ends with a touch of Brighton
pier: 'We won't have beans for supper again,' and some tougher garbage about
defecating at sea.
Even in the supposedly more serious parts, the language fails to take off.
When there is near-mutiny in the fleet about Columbus's lack of leadership,
someone remarks: 'I had hoped that we could settle this with some dignity.'
When they pass a volcano, Columbus comments: 'I saw the volcano in Sicily
when it erupted. It went on for days. You could read by the light.'
The sets, and this is a remarkable comment on the Barbican of all places,
are almost uniformly dreadful. Signs go up periodically to indicate the
changes in time: for instance, 'just off the Canaries, late August 1492',
then again 'later'. It looks like Euston station. The officers in their
cabins look like amateur sailors on a day out off Essex.
It is not remotely funny, or indeed particularly relevant, that Columbus
thinks he is going to Japan. The only part that develops is that of Pulgar,
a once wealthy landowner who is reduced to becoming Columbus's secretary. It
is well played by Philip Voss.
It would be unfair to criticise Jonathan Hyde as Columbus; it is just an
unspeakable part in an unspeakable play. Jane Gurnett as the mistress has
the misfortune (or perhaps the good luck) of disappearing early on.
Does all this matter? Yes. Here is the RSC using some of the same stage
devices it deploys so gloriously in Henry IV, and throwing them away on such
a text. It is a terrible come-down. The best thing to do about John Caird's
production is to forget it.

fire, plus the narrative from the short films playing on the wide TV screens
clustered at seven different sites. There are things to touch: an Olmec
stone jaguar head from 1500BC Veracruz; a buckskin; a snowy feather
headdress and a recently carved 4m high totem. The borrowed tepee even
offers the lingering fragrance of the camp fire. Effects and videos are
exceptionally well done, and the headsets ensure peaceful viewing even if
surrounded by schoolchildren. The pitch is popular, but the quality of the
exhibits is sufficient to captivate the enthusiast for hours.
Glasgow has chosen to focus its show on peoples already familiar to its
audience, and British museum collections unsurprisingly boast rich holdings
of North American Indian artefacts. A far greater treat, however, is the
astounding and generous loans from Mexico. Here are dozens of sculptures,
bas reliefs, frescoes, ceramics and other ritual artefacts that have
survived from the pre-Columbian civilisations of South America. What is
maddening is that one wants to know more about the objects than the bald
captions supply, and the book - rather than catalogue - accompanying the
show does not oblige.
An elaborately carved chalk head from 500-700AD Chiapas, its intertwining
symbols forming a pictorial text, introduces us to a group of Mayan
rarities. A second gallery concentrates on the remarkable clay figurines and
vessels produced 1150-100BC, largely by the Olmecs or under their influence.
One naturalistically relaxed Guerrero figure from 1150-100BC is of a
well-coiffed woman sitting cross-legged in a fringed skirt, her left arm
supporting her weight. The garment draped across her shoulders might almost
be a cardigan. Zapotec funeral urns depicting various divinities are another
highlight.
No doubt much interest is generated by the basalt figure of one of the 400
Aztec gods of intoxication, and by the objects associated with the last
years of Aztec human sacrifice. Flint knives, some decorated with eyes and
teeth, were used to cut out human hearts which were then offered to the sun
to refresh the cosmic energy. Such rituals were to horrify the Spanish
Conquistadores, but was their own Auto da Fe any less morally reprehensible?
Inevitably, the exhibition book is able to explore more fully the
circumstances that compelled the confrontation of the Old and the New
Worlds, the subsequent devastation and, at times, the vital merging of the
two. (Americas Lost, edited by Daniel Levine, published by Bordas, Pounds
19.)
One of the strangest aspects of the chance discovery of the new continent is
how, again and again, the native Americans offered so little resistance to
relatively few Spanish troops and accepted their subjugation. Most of them,
it seems, anticipated the return of white and bearded divinities. That helps
us to understand why the Amerindians were literally demoralised when the
whites revealed themselves not as gods but as slaughterers and oppressors.
Their whole concept of the world was destroyed.
Certainly the record of the European presence in the Americas is shameful.
It is estimated that some 80 per cent of the native population disappeared
during and immediately following the Spanish Conquest. Smallpox and measles
brought death to thousands. The Old World gave its diseases, but took land,
slaves, and the plundered the continent's mineral resources. The great
monuments of the Aztec and Inca empires which had so amazed the
conquistadores were razed to the ground, and Catholic churches erected in
their place.
Unlike the Spanish, the British and French in the North showed little
inclination to intermarry and preferred to colonise Indian land. By the late
1770s, the colonial population outnumbered the Indians. By the end of the
19th century, the Indians had all but shared the fate of the buffalo. It is
with the history of the North American Indian that the exhibition, unlike
the book, loses its balance and objectivity.
We find a muslin tunic taken at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 -
complete with bullet hole - among the pieces placed in old-fashioned museum
display cases. This presumably signifies the end of the living culture of
the Redskin and the beginning of the villainous White Man's ethnography. In
the same room, called 'The Old Museum', the TVs run the old cowboy and injun
movies that celebrate the pioneer's version of American history.
'Pacified America' offers an emotive climax. Its walls are lined with
colourful hand-blocked panoramic wallpaper first produced by Zuber in 1834,
and which hangs in the White House. Entitled 'Scenic America', its portrays
the North American Indian reduced to the indignity of curiosity as he dances
for the amusement of the white man. In the centre of the room, exhibited
behind a wire fence, are a dozen of the 40,000 sepia photographs taken by
Edward S. Curtis at the turn of the century to record the fading glory of
the redskin. They make a mockery of the words of the Star Spangled Banner
resounding in our ears.
In their simplistic portrayal of Indian life, the organisers of this
otherwise excellent exhibition are in danger of romanticising the North
American Indian and simply replacing the myth of the western with another of
late 20th century making, ecologically sound and politically correct.
The exhibition continues at the McLellan Galleries, Glasgow, until September
20, then on to Paris, Strasbourg, Munich, Lyon and Bordeaux

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 




Regarding "Where in the World Was Christopher Columbus?": I would like to bring 
to your attention some historical facts. Although there have been disagreements 
about where Columbus first landed, it is not true that historians are trying to 
decide which island it was in order to celebrate in October, 1992. 


The first islands that Columbus arrived at did not meet the expectations that 
he had derived from Marco Polo's "Voyages" and Pierre d'Ailly's "Imago Mundi." 
The admiral was in search of treasure islands, rich in gold and all kinds of 
precious stones that were supposed to be found in the eastern part of Asia. Not 
until he arrived in Hispaniola (originally Espanola) did he believe he was 
close to his goal, mainly because he finally encountered, although in small 
scale, some gold mines, and, the natives spoke of a region of the island called 
Cibao. Columbus, eager to prove himself right -- especially in the eyes of the 
Spanish crown -- assumed that what the "Indians" were talking about was 
Cipango, an island described in the books he had consulted as one of vast 
wealth and wonders. 


Despite the fact that Columbus did not realize his expectations in Hispaniola 
-- or in any other island that he explored -- it is this island (now a 
territory divided between the Dominican Republic and Haiti) that became the 
first cultural center of the New World. Santo Domingo, in particular, was for 
more than two decades, the place where the conquistadors maintained permanent 
residence while other expeditions were taking place. It was there that the 
first cathedral of the Americas was built and that the remains of Columbus lie. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that Santo Domingo has been chosen as the main 
site for the major celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the encounter of 
the Old and New Worlds.

CHRISTOPHER Columbus would not have approved. The anniversary of his arrival
in the New World 500 years ago today has been expropriated by the very
Indians whose subjugation followed his arrival. Celebrations have turned
into protests by Indian groups at the miserable conditions and
discrimination under which they live.
Indian activists in Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico
have staged street marches. In Nicaragua, indigenous groups from 24
countries are converging for a conference: 500 years of indigenous
resistance, black and popular.
'There is nothing to celebrate,' says Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan
Indian and human rights activist leading the conference. 'The rights of the
Indian peoples continue to be violated,' says Ms Menchu, a candidate for
this year's Nobel peace prize.
Latin nations, faced with the choice between celebrating with Spain and
Portugal or sympathising with oppressed indigenous groups, have chosen the
latter, or stayed silent. One hundred years ago, the same creole elites
ruling the continent faced no such inhibitions: the Guatemalan government
forced 20,000 Indians to march through the capital to celebrate the 400th
anniversary of Columbus' arrival.
In Mexico, while the government has been virtually silent, hundreds of
Indians have converged on Mexico City, where they will gather today in the
capital's central square. Genero Dominguez, an indigenous activist on hunger
strike there, says the campaign is to 'remind the world of the crimes
committed against us in the name of progress and discovery'.
The mobilisation of indigenous groups across Latin America in part reflects
the repression and deterioration in living standards they suffered in the
1980s in particular.
Anti-Columbus campaigning has provided a focus for their concerns. 'Everyone
is talking about Indians,' says Mr Domingo Hernandez, a Guatemalan Indian in
exile in Mexico City. 'It is the first step in our fight to be recognised.'
In the cities of Mexico, Indians are 'poor, often extremely poor, and have
the lowest, most vulnerable, precarious conditions,' according to a
government report. Inevitably, their cultural identity is threatened: 'The
culture of the Maya is based on land, corn, the family and communal life.'
says Mr Domingo Hernandez, a Guatemalan Indian in exile in Mexico City.
'When you come to the cities this changes.'
Government policy across Latin America has systematically favoured urban
over rural areas where the majority of indigenous peoples live. Some 70 per
cent of Mexico's 8m Indians live in rural areas. Even in the countryside,
the Indians are the poorest: 97 per cent of Mexico's rural Indians live in
'impoverished' counties, against 23 per cent of rural Mexicans in general.
No one knows the exact number of Indians killed in land disputes or by
security forces in the 1980s, but Amnesty International concluded in a
report released last week that mass killings may have reduced in scale in
the past 500 years, but 'they have never stopped.' In Guatemala alone tens
of thousands of Indians were murdered in the 1980s by state security forces
in the campaign to eliminate leftist insurgency groups.
Those celebrating the quincentenary appear slightly embarrassed. In the
Dominican Republic, a visit by the Pope threatened to become a public
relations disaster. He was to have inaugurated the light-house on land
Colombus first spotted, but the Vatican became embarrassed at criticism that
it would take a large slice of the country's electricity and infrastructure
spending. The lighthouse was opened last week before the Pope arrived.
The discrimination, and poverty in which most Indians live means it will
take time before any new concern leads to results. Mr Guillermo Espinosa,
head of Mexico's National Indigenous Institute warns: 'The indigenous
peoples will keep on protesting, but I am very sceptical the general public
will change their opinion. There may now be a sentimental reaction but there
is not an analytical or objective understanding of their plight.'

ON A low hill overlooking the harbour in Santo Domingo, capital of the
Dominican Republic, teams of workmen are scrambling over a massive concrete
structure that was designed 43 years ago. The government hopes it will be
completed this year.
The Columbus Lighthouse, a monument whose completion is costing millions of
dollars, is central to much that is happen- ing in the country this year.
The lighthouse is the most ambitious part of the country's commemoration -
celebration, says the official literature - of the arrival of Christopher
Columbus in the Caribbean 500 years ago.
Columbus fever is running high in the country. One weekend earlier this
month, thousands of Dominicans flocked to the port in Santo Domingo to view
the replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa Maria, Columbus's famed
boats, which were on a short visit.
'This will be a good year for this country,' says the head of a local
business group. 'We are celebrating a milestone.'
Preparations for the event are evident all over Santo Domingo. Roads and
bridges are being improved, the colonial section of the city is being
rebuilt and efforts are under way to improve the electricity supply. The
administrators of the country's tourist industry expect an increase in the
volume of visitors, drawn by the focus on Columbus.
Cynics and the political cognoscenti concur that 500 years after he arrived,
Columbus still has a profound effect on contemporary Dominican politics.
They say Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the president, was determined to stand again
for office in the 1990 elections simply to be in charge of this year's
events.
According to the Dominican Commission for the Celeb- ration of the
Quincentenary, La Isabela, established on Hispaniola by Columbus on his
second voyage, was the 'first seat of western civilisation in America,' and
produced 'the miracle that today we call America.'
It was the Dominican Republic, according to the commission, which was the
centre of the transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America'.
The country, it says, was the site of the first mass celebrated in the
Americas, the first munic- ipality, the first city, the first viceregal
court, the first university and the first cathedral in which, incid-
entally, Columbus is buried until his remains are moved to the lighthouse
which is being built.
Dominicans appear oblivious to the consternation which they have created in
other parts of the region, not by their claim on Columbus, but because of
the language which they use. There is little tolerance of suggestions that
the use of the word 'discovery' is eschewed by most of their neighbours who
prefer to 'commemorate' the event as an 'encounter' of Europe with the
Americas.
'Of course there were people here when Columbus got here,' agrees the
business leader. 'But if he did not discover them no one would have known
they were here. He brought them Christianity and civilisation. I must be
thankful. I would not be here if it had not been for Columbus.'

'BONJOUR BLANC': A JOURNEY THROUGH HAITI by Ian Thomson Hutchinson Pounds
16.99, 352 pages
IAN THOMSON, a 30-year-old Briton, spent months travelling over a
God-forsaken and singular land: 'a country turned upside down', according to
one of the book's characters. This is a lively account of life in Haiti that
alternately stimulates sympathy, humour and despair.
Haiti is at this moment in the grip of military repression. The Tonton
Macoutes, the terrifying security force of the dictatorships of 'Papa Doc'
Duvalier and his son, have been resuming their positions of power around the
island. Soldiers, having ousted the elected president, are beating, killing
and arresting hundreds of people. As Thomson says: 'The horror of Haiti has
always been in the army.'
The trail of blood goes back at least to Columbus, for we know little of it
before. Within 50 years of the navigator's arrival, the half million Arawak
indians on the island had perished and the pre-Columbian culture had all but
vanished. Columbus established in Haiti the first European settlement in the
New World, 500 years ago this year. When he returned 11 months later, the
settlement had been razed and his men killed. Columbus described a land of
spices and cotton, mastic and aloes and 'a thousand other things of value'.
What Thomson finds is 'a vast slum floating a few hundred miles off Florida,
the poorest nation in the western hemisphere.'
When independence was declared from Napoleon's France on New Year's Day
1804, Haiti became the first black republic: in today's parlance, the first
third world country. Napoleon himself had cruelly deceived one of its few
unalloyed heroes: Toussaint L'Ouverture, who led the the slave revolt that
eventually brought about independence. His life ended in a dank French gaol.
His hopes for democracy have never been realised: leader after leader used
their positions to pillage the state. 'Pluck the chicken as long as it does
not squawk,' said Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Thomson
follows fascinating trails all over the land: to the probable site of that
first European settlement; on a search for the descendants of the Poles who
settled part of the island and for Alexandre Dumas the Elder, the half-caste
father of the author of the Count of Monte Cristo; to voodoo ceremonies. He
talks to a zombi; to an ancestor of Simon Bolivar; to a sad Englishman
ending his days among people who, even if they have heard of his native
land, believe it to be one of the United States of America; and to many
others.
This book is the fruit of no little courage and long research. If it has a
fault, it is the author's apparent unwillingness to leave out a fact
painstakingly gathered or an individual met along the way. There is a
surfeit of italics - French, creole, Spanish, Latin - which disturbs the
narrative. As a result, the book is perhaps overlong. It remains none the
less an achievement; a colourful, vital book of important insight.

LAND ROVER North America has outlined to its 80-strong dealer network a
strategy to quadruple sales of its UK-built four-wheel-drive vehicles in the
US.
Plans to lift annual sales to 16,000, from just over 4,000 last year, depend
heavily on the success of the Land Rover Discovery model, which is to be
launched in North America early next year. Currently, dealers are selling
only the luxury Range Rover and high specification versions of the utility
Land Rover Defender.
The company, part of the British Aerospace-owned Rover Group, is calling for
a substantial structural change in the dealer network to cope with the
expansion.
Mr David Schworm, vice-president, has told dealers by letter that Land Rover
wants as many as possible to drop their practice of selling its products
alongside other luxury vehicle franchises - known as 'dualling' - and set up
large outlets selling exclusively Land Rover's vehicles.
These 'Land Rover Centres', of which the company would like about 30, would
have sales territories covering many square miles and would operate
'satellite' showrooms under the same ownership. The concept, aimed at
preventing Land Rover dealers from having to compete against each other, has
been pioneered - with considerable success - in North America by General
Motors' Saturn subsidiary.
However, Saturn is a volume franchise. Dealers in other more up-market makes
have traditionally resisted their manufacturers' pressure for exclusive
outlets, arguing that they do not offer adequate returns. Such resistance is
understood to lie at least partly behind Mazda of Japan's decision last year
not to proceed with setting up a separate luxury car sales channel - Amati -
at a time of economic recession.
The Discovery, which is expected to sell for some Dollars 30,000 (Pounds
20,000) in the US, compared with Dollars 40,000 upwards for the Range Rover,
is expected rapidly to take the lion's share of Land Rover's intended 16,000
total annual sales in North America.
Earlier this month it was announced that Honda, which has a 20 per cent
shareholding in Rover, was to sell the Discovery under its own badge in
Japan, where it will be known as the Honda Crossroad.

OUTTAKES: WIND IN THEIR SALES 




By Pat H. Broeske 




Is there room on the Atlantic Ocean -- and on the big screen -- for two 
Christopher Columbuses? 


There was room last week in the trade papers for splashy multi-page ads touting 
two such projects, both to be released in 1992 to capitalize on the 500th 
anniversary of the Italian explorer's voyage to North America in the service of 
Spain. 


Producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind are working with a script by Mario Puzo, 
"Christopher Columbus: The Movie," with plans to begin shooting in April. They 
claim to have "exclusive" access to Spain's full-size re-creations of the Nina, 
Pinta and Santa Maria, now under construction. The father-and-son team 
responsible for the "Superman" movies will also "use members of the Spanish 
navy as extras," a spokesman tells us. 


To be budgeted at $45-$50 million, the Salkinds' film is planned as a July 4, 
1992, global release, with Universal Pictures handling domestic distribution. A 
source reports that David Lean is being considered as director. 


Undaunted, producer-director Ridley Scott plans "Christopher Columbus," from a 
script by French journalist Roselyne Bosch. It will "go beyond the history 
books" to tell "the truth about the man and what happened," says a Scott 
spokeswoman. The film's star -- and start date -- will be announced shortly. 


What about the Salkinds' claim to ties with the Spanish government? 


"We've had some of the same conversations (with Spanish officials) and they're 
supportive," says the Scott spokeswoman. "1992 is a big year for Spain. They 
won't care if there are 10 films about Christopher Columbus." Pat H. Broeske

IN 1492, as every schoolchild on either side of the Atlantic knows, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue and landed - second stop - on the shores of the island
that he christened Hispaniola. Almost 500 years later, Joaquin Balaguer,
president of the Dominican Republic, is set to milk the quincentenary for
all the political capital it is worth.
The organising committee claims the republic is the starting point for the
transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America.' The old
colonial quarter of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic's capital, is
being renovated. Roads and bridges are being repaired. New tourist
facilities are being prepared for the 1m or more visitors expected for the
October celebrations.
In the biggest and costliest venture of all, the government is finally
completing the 60-year-old plans of former dictator Rafael Trujillo for a
mammoth Columbus lighthouse. This is meant to be the last resting place for
Columbus's bones and from the top it will project a 1m-candlepower crucifix
into the night sky. Pope John Paul II will be on hand to bless the
lighthouse when it is formally opened.
There are plenty of ironies here. The blind octogenarian President Balaguer
is responsible for lighting the light. The lighthouse that the Pope will
bless has been carved out of one of the capital's slums. And hundreds of
people have been displaced and scattered to provide room for the monument,
its vast grass surroundings and pools and fountains.
Yet when the lighthouse light has been switched on, all surrounding
electricity has frequently gone off, for up to four hours a time. Even
without the lighthouse, power cuts are frequent in the Dominican Republic.
The monument cannot be counted as one of the seven or even 77 or probably
even 777 wonders of the modern world. Do not start to think of the
lighthouse as a gracefully tall tower on the edge of land warning of rocks
and treacherous seas. There is nothing graceful about this hulk, a chunk of
gloomy grey concrete faced with marble and engraved with crosses. It is not
on the edge of the sea, and the only noteworthy landmark is the slum now
pushed 700 metres away.
I had expected to see some phallic monster. In fact, the Columbus lighthouse
is broader than it is long, covering two street blocks of the former slum.
It shows all the imagination of some communist functionary's dreams.
Of all the projects the Pope has blessed, this seems the hardest to justify
for a man of God or a man of compassion. At least the massive new basilica
at Yamassukro, in the Ivory Coast countryside, modelled on  - but bigger
than - St Peter's in Rome, could claim to be a monument to God as well as to
President Houphouet-Boigny.
Perhaps a stern Polish Pope will appreciate the austere grey outlines of the
Columbus lighthouse. But didn't his advisers ask awkward questions about a
cross on top of a lighthouse? Normally, a light warns ships to keep their
distance. Is the cross in the night sky meant to be a beacon or a warning to
the world?
Among other plans, the government of the Dominican Republic is going all out
to attract tourists. It has an eye on cruise-ships, which it hopes to
persuade to call at the rundown port where only a few rusting tramp ships
are now in evidence. It makes sense to a hard-pressed economy where tourism
is already the largest money-spinner, worth Dollars 800m last year.
But there is still a long way to go before anyone would rate Santo Domingo a
must destination, even on a sun-soaked cruise.
The old town has its nice points: some delicate old Spanish-style houses,
pretty squares, the house where Columbus's brother lived, the oldest
cathedral in the New World begun in 1596. But you can walk around it all
very quickly.

HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON; 


COLORADO PLAYERS DRAW INSPIRATION FROM MEMORY OF SAL AUNESE 




By SALLY JENKINS, WASHINGTON POST 




BOULDER, Colo. 




Colorado acknowledges Sal Aunese as if he is still present. "Sal says" and "Sal 
is," the Buffaloes say. They nominate him for MVP awards, wear his name on 
their jersey sleeves, and point to the places he should and used to be. 


There is more than just a season going on at Colorado. A team that a year ago 
was blighted by arrests plays with greater cause and emotion than anyone in the 
country after burying its 21-year-old quarterback. That the Buffaloes are 
undefeated at 5-0 and ranked No. 3 is the least of what has happened here. 


On Sept. 23 at 8:47 p.m. Aunese died of stomach and lung cancer. But as a 
clergyman told them during a memorial service, and as running back Eric 
Bieniemy repeats over and over: "Sal's still here. You just have to point a 
little higher." 


The death of Aunese and the fervent play of the Buffaloes have apparently drawn 
together a team once rife with trouble. From January 1986 to Jan uary 1989, 
there were 24 arrests (18 in 1987) involving current or former football 
players, ranging from two rape accusations (both acquittals) to misdemeanor 
assaults such as throwing a magazine at a person. Just as public outcry reached 
a height, Aunese fell ill, and so they were struck by a humiliating alienation 
on campus and overwhelming grief at the same time. 


Over the last six months there have been several player departures and some 
searching discussions with campus officials, police, counselors and each other. 
There has also been the hard spiritualism of Coach Bill McCartney, who during a 
memorial service acknowledged publicly for the first time that Aunese fathered 
the son born last spring to his 19-year-old daughter, Kristin. 


So this overwrought season has become both a public memorial to Aunese and an 
attempt at redemption by the Buffaloes. They aspire to the Orange Bowl and a 
shot at the national championship; their last outright Big Eight championship 
came in 1961, and not since 1977 have they been ranked higher than both of the 
perennial conference champions, Oklahoma and Nebraska. On a board in their 
meeting room is a sketch of a set of steps, each one labeled with the name of 
an opponent. At the top it says, "Sal." 


"We went through a lot," McCartney said. "But you forge a sword in fire. Going 
through a furnace of affliction has a way of bringing you together." 


How they have individually dealt with the turmoil is more complicated. 
McCartney has not com-mented on his grandson again. Aunese's best friend, 
defensive tackle Okland Salavea, returns to his room each night after practice 
and talks as though Aunese is with him. Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan, 
once known for brashness, has quieted. "I've lost all that," he said. "There's 
no place for mouthiness." Bieniemy instinctively glances up at the private box 
where Aunese watched the first three games of the season with oxygen tubes 
across his thinning face. His intention was to live until the Oklahoma game on 
Oct. 28. 


"I really believe Sal is a major part of this team, how it came together," 
Salavea said, eyes welling. "When he was diagnosed, everyone dropped to their 
knees. We all looked at each other and said, 'Why Sal?' And there's just no 
answer. Sal told us there's nothing we can't do, that it all depends on us. 
That's what we're carrying right now." 


Against Iowa State Saturday, the Buffaloes were seeking to become 6-0 for the 
first time since 1961. They have manhandled every opponent regardless of how 
respectable, including Texas (27-6), Illinois (38-7) and Washington (45-28). 
Their 204 points scored is an all-time high for the school after five games. 
The Washington game was particularly indicative of the power of their option 
offense, as they led by 38-6 after three quarters and scored the most points by 
a visiting team in Husky Stadium in 60 years. 


For his part, Aunese was no angel certainly, merely a talented, handsome fellow 
of Samoan descent who had his shortcomings like anyone else. In 1988 he served 
12 days in jail after pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault. He was also an 
intelligent and admired leader, majoring in sociology and on schedule to 
graduate, taking summer classes even as he was treated for his illness. 


Also at the same time, he sought to help remedy a team torn by its past and 
experiencing occasional dissent and murmurs of destructive egos. "Sometimes 
you'd have a guy trying to do too much, and another guy not doing enough," 
defensive tackle Art Walker said. "There was some complaining, bickering." They 
were somewhat isolated from an angered campus and sometimes from each other. 


"There were guys on this team I didn't even know," Salavea said quietly. 
"That's embarrassing. Now it doesn't matter where you see them or what you're 
doing, you stop and talk to them. You ask them how they are." 


Aunese left behind a letter to the team urging the players to pull together and 
to make the Orange Bowl. "We had to start doing things together," Bieniemy 
said. 


Aunese has also become a sort of constant second thought for the Buffaloes, an 
internal caution and reminder of their new code of behavior. As players who 
normally had little to say to each other began collecting in groups, monitoring 
of each other became a habit. The Buffaloes say that has helped prevent more 
incidents like those over the last two years. "Everybody is there to talk you 
out of whatever bad, stupid thing you're about to do," Salavea said. 


Many of the problems were minor, a handful of them major. Aunese's trouble came 
when he pleaded guilty after tearing up a dormitory, enraged by what he said 
was a racial slur. Bieniemy pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct after a 
bar fight as a freshman, also saying he was angered by a racial remark. There 
was a shoplifting offense that resulted in suspension; someone else had an 
argument with a girlfriend. 


The incidents occurred on an otherwise quiet, affluent campus of pink granite 
and tiled roofs at the foot of pine-studded mountains. It is known for 
bandleader Glenn Miller, who as an undergraduate would drive up to the mesas 
and play under the moon and his headlights. Also for Supreme Court Justice 
Byron White, who as the Whizzer led the Buffaloes to an 8-0 start in 1937, and 
for Hale Irwin, a defensive back who graduated in 1966 and became a U.S. Open 
golf champion. 


It is also a campus where minorities make up 10.3 percent of the student body 
of 24,365, with 867 Hispanics, 905 Asians and 343 blacks. That, coupled with 
the usual ambivalence of a campus toward its football team, may have 
exacerbated some of the clashes. "They were saying (urban) people like us were 
the problem," Walker said. To Salavea, an imposing figure with close-clipped 
black hair and a dangling braid, perceptions and labels were partly 
responsible. "People said, 'They're just football players. They'll do what's 
expected of them -- nothing good at all.' " 


Bieniemy said, "We set ourselves up for it. It never would have happened if we 
had thought twice. People were pointing us out, but we also let ourselves in 
for it." 


McCartney steadfastly maintains there was no severe discipline problem on the 
team, more a series of clashes with townspeople or other students in a small, 
protective community with some strict ordinances. Even so, severe action was 
taken: of the two players acquitted of rape, one chose to leave, the other was 
asked to. Several other players on the spring roster are gone, for various 
reasons. "We weren't experiencing anything that society in general doesn't 
undergo," McCartney said. "Boulder is a unique place, and some inner-city kids 
had to adjust to it. ... I felt we ran a disciplined program, and yet we were 
having all these altercations. We had to call them to account in a stricter 
way." 


There have been no reported instances of encounters with police since the 
spring. Exchange and counseling programs between players and police were 
mandated by university officials to alleviate tensions. 


A truer indication of whether Colorado has put behavioral problems behind is 
more likely to come later. But getting over the loss of Aunese is another 
thing. That healing process will also go far beyond one season. 


"I don't think there's been a recovery," Bieniemy said. "We've adjusted. I 
don't think we'll ever recover."

 [Report by David Berlioz for the "This Very Day" newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas has recognized 
that the expropriation of property owned by North Americans may 
deteriorate trade relations between Honduras and the United 
States. 
  According to an article in THE NEW HERALD, an increasingly 
long list of North Americans, perhaps 30, have lost their 
property in Honduras due to expropriation, embezzlement, or 
illegal maneuvers to the point that the incidents are irritating 
Washington and its relations with Honduras. 
  The article includes quotes from statements made by a U.S. 
Embassy official in our country according to whom investing or 
buying real estate in Honduras is extremely risky. He adds that 
North American investors and owners want to do everything 
correctly, in strict abidance by Honduran laws, but piranhas are 
eating them alive. 
  Undoubtedly, the article seriously affects Honduras' chances 
of attracting highly sought foreign investments. 
  [Begin Callejas recording] In my opinion, it is obvious 
that much of this happens because it is presumed that the law 
will always favor them because they are North Americans. That 
is not necessarily the case. [end recording] 
  According to the president, the situation could undermine 
relations between the two countries, particularly trade 
relations. 
  [Begin Callejas recording] Remember that the United States 
makes the introduction of our products under preferential terms 
contingent upon its foreign policy, so complex situations may 
arise. [end recording] 
  The president mentioned the case of the United Nations Park, 
which was erroneously registered in a person's name during 
General Tiburcio Carias Andino's administration even though the 
families that owned the land at the time were compensated. 
  [Begin Callejas recording] A North American purchased the 
land even though he knew about this error, or perhaps he acted 
in good faith. However, an error in the implementation of the 
law does not imply that the state is guilty of an illegitimate 
action. Therefore, the state believes it has the right to 
purchase the land at El Picacho. That is one of the cases 
involved. Consequently, we must be fair here and act within the 
framework of Honduran society. We must accept the fact that the 
North Americans are not necessarily right all the time. [end 
recording]

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 


FRANCESA STIRS FIFTH-DOWN DEBATE AGAIN 




By RICK WARNER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 




Like a nagging cold or a persistent salesman, the fifth-down controversy just 
won't go away. 


The uproar over Colorado's disputed 33-31 victory over Missouri started to fade 
a few weeks after the Oct. 6 game. But CBS commentator Mike Francesa is 
stirring it up again. 


Francesa, one of 60 voters in the Associated Press college football poll, is 
troubled by the fact that Colorado scored the winning touchdown on what proved 
to be an illegal extra down. So troubled that the second-ranked Buffaloes might 
not get his vote as national champion even if they beat No. 1 Notre Dame in the 
Orange Bowl. 


"If it's a close situation, that (fifth-down) game could be a factor," Francesa 
says. 


And what's a close situation? Francesa says that if Colorado barely beats Notre 
Dame and third-ranked Miami or No. 4 Georgia Tech rout their bowl opponents, he 
might vote the Hurricanes or Yellow Jackets No. 1. 


"Think about it," Francesa says. "If that happens, you'd be talking about an 
unbeaten Tech team vs. a Colorado team with one loss, one tie and one shadowy 
game." 


Francesa recently infuriated Colorado fans by making similar remarks on a 
Denver radio station. 


"He's not going to win any popularity contests out here," says Dave Plati, the 
school's sports information director. 


Like other Colorado defenders, Plati points out that the Buffaloes 
intentionally spiked the ball on the next-to-last play because they thought it 
was third down. It actually was the fourth down, but a mixup by the officials 
gave Colorado another play, which turned out to be the winning 1-yard sneak by 
Charles Johnson. 


Plati says the Buffaloes wouldn't have spiked the ball had they known it was 
the fourth down. 


"Doesn't he (Francesa) know the facts?" Plati says. "Why should we be punished 
for playing under the guidelines we were given? People think we're the villain 
because they think we cheated. And that's just not true." 


Francesa considers the victory tainted even though it was upheld by the Big 
Eight. 


Despite his reservations about the fifth-down game, Francesa says he would vote 
the Buffaloes No. 1 if they win impressively on New Year's Day and no other 
team makes a convincing case for the national championship.

ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' DISCOVERY 




Rodriguez asks us not to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Christopher 
Columbus' great adventure, which he prefers to call "genocide." 


Forget for the moment that Spain's attitude towards the indigenous peoples of 
America was no different than it was toward non-Christians at home, and in the 
same year that Columbus sailed into the unknown the Jews were driven out of 
Spain, forced to leave all of their property behind them, and that the horrors 
of the Inquisition were in full control of the lives of the people of Spain. 


No, Mr. Rodriguez, we are not going to celebrate genocide, but rather the 
accomplishment of one rather courageous individual, whose adventure still 
stands as the greatest voyage of mankind, including Neil Armstrong's walk on 
the moon. In truth, a parallel would have Armstrong pleading with the President 
-- over a period of eight years -- for use of a castoff spaceship and the 
company of a few criminals and debtors to go with him on a voyage that he would 
plan and carry out alone. 


Columbus' serendipity -- a new world instead of China and Japan -- brought 
lesser men after him, and when he punished a few Spanish gentlemen for 
murdering Indians he was himself removed from power and returned to Spain in 
chains.

CHURCH COUNCIL CONDEMNS COLUMBUS, CITES INDIANS 




From United Press International 




PITTSBURGH 




The National Council of Churches has approved a resolution condemning 
Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492 because of its impact on 
Indians. 


The resolution was introduced Thursday night to the ecumenical Christian group 
by the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage Indian who called Columbus' arrival an 
"invasion" that brought about the slavery and genocide of native Americans. 


"American people have so digested the myth on American history that they have 
lost sight of the truth -- the pain of so many people who live on the 
continent," Tinker said. 


A competing resolution introduced by the Right Rev. David Reed, an Episcopal 
bishop from Kentucky, sought to soften the language of Tinker's offering. 


His resolution acknowledged the injustice and pain suffered by Indians after 
the arrival of Columbus and other European explorers, but sought to retain the 
"passion and words" of Tinker's resolution while adding positive aspects of the 
last 500 years. 


After a heated debate, Reed's resolution effectively was killed. 


Reed said he did not believe that anyone will take Tinker's resolution 
seriously because of its strong wording.
