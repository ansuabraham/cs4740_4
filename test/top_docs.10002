TELLING DOLPHIN FROM PORPOISE 




By MARK A. STEIN 




Just what is the difference between a porpoise and a dolphin, anyway? 


Not much. At least not much to the casual whale watcher. 


According to the American Cetacean Society, "It would be convenient to 
differentiate dolphins and porpoises, if only there was some rule we could use. 
. . . Unfortunately, there isn't." 


"Some animals are always known as dolphins, and some are always called 
porpoises," the society explains simply in a guide written by Richard Ellis, 
author of "The Book of Whales" and "Dolphins and Porpoises." 


Generally, however, small cetaceans with a "beak" are called dolphins; those 
with a rounded head profile are referred to as porpoises. 


Indeed, most small cetaceans conveniently fit this profile. The spinners, 
spotters and bottlenose are all dolphins, while the harbor and speedy Dall's 
porpoises have more rounded heads. 


But there are notable exceptions, often quite confusing. The pilot whale, for 
example, is not really a whale, but a member of the dolphin family. But its 
head is distinctively rounded, like that of a porpoise. 


The killer whale, too, is not a whale but a dolphin. Yet it also has a head 
more rounded than beaked. 


At the same time, some true whales have beaks, such as the giant bottlenose 
whale or the Cuvier's beaked whale. 


A more specific -- though, for most casual observers, less useful -- way to 
distinguish porpoises from dolphins is to look at their teeth. 


Scientists say that true porpoises have spade-shaped teeth, while those of most 
other small cetaceans are tapered and sharply pointed. MARK A. STEIN

PORPOISE STRANDED ON BEACH DIES 




From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




A young female porpoise that was found on a Santa Cruz beach died Saturday, two 
weeks after she was washed up on shore with injuries and in distress. The 
porpoise, named Truda, died at Marine World Africa USA in Vallejo where it had 
been kept in a holding tank since Oct. 6.

Threatened Fish and Wildlife; Listing of the Gulf of Maine Population of Harbor Porpoise as Threatened under the Endangered
Species Act






AGENCY:



 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.











ACTION:



 Proposed rule; extension of comment period. 












SUMMARY:



 NMFS is extending the comment period on the proposed rule to list Gulf of Maine (GME) harbor porpoise to allow public
comment on the population status of harbor porpoise following the receipt of new data and information on the 1990&hyph;93
bycatch rates.











DATES:



 Comments must be received by September 11, 1994. 











ADDRESSES:



 Comments should be addressed to Director, Office of Protected Resources, 1335 East-West Highway, Room 8268, Silver
Spring, MD 20910.











FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



 Michael Payne or Margot Bohan, 301/713&hyph;2322.











SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 On January 7, 1993 (58 FR 3108), NMFS proposed to designate the GME population of harbor porpoise as threatened under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The final determination on the proposed rule to list harbor porpoise was extended
at 58 FR 59230 on November 8, 1993, to allow for analysis of the 1993 bycatch data prior to final determination. At that
time, NMFS also stated that it would reopen the comment period following completion of these analyses. NMFS reopened
the comment period on the proposed rule on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36158) to allow for public review and comment on the 1993
bycatch estimates, as well as on the 1990&hyph;92 estimates that were adjusted following comments received at a February
1994 workshop on the status of harbor porpoise in the GME.





The final 1990&hyph;93 bycatch estimates considered those harbor porpoise that are taken in the gillnets, but fall
out of the net as the nets are being hauled onto the vessel, and as a result have not been included in bycatch estimates
to date. These bycatch estimates and proceedings from a February 1994 harbor porpoise workshop were made available
upon request.

The New England Harbor Porpoise Working Group (HPWG) met on July 21, 1994, along with staff from the NMFS/Northeast
Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) to discuss this information. The HPWG membership consists of gillnet fishermen
throughout New England coastal states, NMFS and NEFMC representatives, environmental organizations, and several
biologists from non-governmental organizations who have studied the biology and fishery-interaction issues of
harbor porpoise throughout the GME since 1990. During the meeting of the HPWG, they recommended that the revised bycatch
estimates should be more fully explained so that public review and comment could provide more meaningful input to
NMFS prior to the final determination.

In response to the HPWG's recommendation the NEFSC is preparing a document which will address these concerns and which
will become available in early August 1994. The HPWG further stated that if the public process was to be effective,
more time would be needed for fishermen and other interested parties to consider the forthcoming information. Given
that the comment period on the proposed rule is scheduled to close on August 11, 1999 and that this would not allow enough
time to allow for public review of the document being prepared by the NEFSC, NMFS hereby extends the present comment
period until September 11, 1994. NMFS intends that this will be the final comment period on the proposed rule.










Dated: August 8, 1994.

Northeast Multispecies Fishery 






AGENCY:



 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National 

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.









ACTION:



 Final rule.










SUMMARY:



 NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures 

contained in Framework Adjustment 4 to the Northeast Multispecies 

Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The measures contained in this 

rule are a series of time and area closures for sink gillnet gear 

to reduce bycatch of harbor porpoise. These measures replace 

blocks of time during each month during which all sink gillnets 

would be required to be removed from the water. The intent of 

this rule is to reduce significantly the bycatch of harbor 

porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.









EFFECTIVE DATE:



 May 20, 1994.









ADDRESSES:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 

Background 





The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) 

submitted Amendment 5 to NMFS on September 27, 1993. One of its 

principal objectives was to reduce the bycatch of harbor porpoise 

in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery by the end of year 4 of 

implementation of the Amendment to a level not to exceed 2 percent 

of the population, based on the best estimates of abundance and 

bycatch. 

The Council was requested by NMFS in October 1992 to take 

action to reduce the harbor porpoise bycatch within the context of 

Amendment 5. The Council agreed to develop fishery management 

measures that would address the issue on the basis that the sink 

gillnet fishery was subject to regulation under the FMP, there 

were no existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce porpoise takes, 

and the current level of bycatch in the fishery was not 

sustainable. 

Additionally, on January 7, 1993, NMFS published a proposed 

rule (58 FR 3108) to list the Gulf of Maine population of harbor 

porpoise as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due 

primarily to the level of incidental takes in the sink gillnet 

fishery and the lack of an adequate regulatory mechanism to 

accomplish bycatch reductions. As NMFS noted in the rule, the 

Marine Mammal Exemption Program contained in the 1988 amendments 

to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) did not set bycatch 

limits. 

The Council subsequently adopted the goal of achieving 

reductions in harbor porpoise bycatch, so that the actual amount 

of harbor porpoise caught as bycatch in the sink gillnet fishery 

would not exceed 2 percent of the estimates of the harbor porpoise 

population, in part to avoid the pending ESA listing. This 

objective was based on a recruitment rate for harbor porpoise that 

is about 4 percent per year, and a conservative fisheries bycatch 

level that should not exceed 50 percent of the recruitment rate 

for marine mammals. The 1991/1992 pooled harbor porpoise 

population abundance estimate is 47,200. Using the lower bound of 

the 95-percent confidence interval for that estimate, 39,500, the 

1990, 1991, and 1992 ratios of bycatch to average population 

abundance were approximately 6 percent, 4.3 percent and 

2.2 percent, respectively. A 2-percent goal allocated solely to 

the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery did not take into account 

the unknown level of harbor porpoise takes in the Mid-Atlantic 

region and in adjacent Canadian waters. 

Because the 1992 abundance and bycatch information was not 

available until June 1993, however, development of effective 

measures based on the best scientific information lagged behind 

the formulation of the overall Amendment 5 package. The harbor 

porpoise bycatch mitigation measure implemented by the final rule 

for the Amendment required the removal of all sink gillnets from 

the water during 4-day blocks of time each month in year 1 after 

implementation of Amendment 5. Years 2 and 3 of Amendment 5 

called for 8-day blocks each month. Year 4 required 12-day blocks 

and year 5 required 16-day blocks. The Council supported, and 

NMFS approved, the use of blocks of time as an interim measure on 

the assumption that appropriate time and area management measures 

would be developed as soon as possible. 

The rationale for the interim measure was based largely on 

the lack of information concerning the sink gillnet fishery. By 

``masking'' periods of time monthly, during which all sink gillnets 

must be removed from the water, the time during which harbor 

porpoise would be exposed to that gear would be reduced. In a 

simulation analyzing the effect of closing the Gulf of Maine sink 

gillnet fishery for 4 consecutive random days per month, 

approximately 8.5 percent of the fish would not be landed and 9.3 

percent of the harbor porpoise bycatch would be avoided. The 

effect of choosing random days, however, produced very different 

values of harbor porpoise bycatch for the different trials.

of time, and upon receipt of the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science 

Center's (NEFSC) comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis of 

the bycatch in the fall of 1993, the Council voted to support the 

development of a time and area closure management system. The 

intent was to replace the existing gillnet alternative (nets 

removed from the water for specified blocks of time) as the harbor 

porpoise bycatch mitigation measure. The Council decided, and 

NMFS agreed, that the gillnet fleet would not be subject to 

groundfish effort reductions until the effect of the harbor 

porpoise bycatch reduction measures could be evaluated for their 

impacts on groundfish fishing effort (approximately 1 year after 

implementation of Amendment 5). 

NMFS is amending the regulations under the framework 

abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and 

codified at 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure requires 

the Council, when making specifically allowed adjustments to the 

FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span of at least 

two Council meetings. The Council must provide the public with 

advance notice of both the proposals and the analysis, and 

opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council 

meeting. Upon review of the analysis and public comment, the 

Council may recommend to the Regional Director of NMFS that the 

measures be published as a final rule if certain conditions are 

met. The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) 

may publish the measures as a final rule or as a proposed rule if 

additional public comment is needed. 

The Council complied with the procedural requirements and 

submitted the rule to NMFS, and NMFS concurs with the provisions 

of the Council's submission. This final rule implements time and 

area closures based on an analysis by the NEFSC of harbor porpoise 

bycatch using NMFS weighout and observer program data on the 

distribution of sink gillnet activity and the seasonal and spatial 

distribution of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine. Extensive 

discussions among the Council, the fishing industry and scientists 

led to the measures outlined below. 

For purposes of the management measures contained in this 

final rule for Framework Adjustment 



#



4, the Gulf of Maine is 

divided into three areas: The Northeast (from Penobscot Bay to 

Eastport, ME); Mid-coast (from Cape Ann to Penobscot Bay); and 

Massachusetts Bay (from Cape Cod to Cape Ann). The Council 

recommended 30-day closures for each of these areas. The timing 

of the closures corresponds to periods when harbor porpoise 

bycatch is most likely to occur. The duration accounts for the 

variability of harbor porpoise movements. The Council recognizes 

that the Mid-coast and Northeast areas account for more of the 

bycatch than Massachusetts Bay. At this time, however, harbor 

porpoise bycatch mitigation measures are being applied uniformly 

across all regions in the Gulf of Maine. 

The NEFSC estimated that reductions of 20 to 40 percent might 

be realized in the first year of implementation of Framework 

Adjustment 



#



4 if boundaries discussed in its initial analysis of a 

time and area management system for the Gulf of Maine were used in 

conjunction with the proposed 30-day closures. The Council's 

boundary modifications could alter that estimate to some unknown 

degree because of the potential displacement of gillnet fishing 

effort to areas where harbor porpoise are still subject to some 

level of bycatch. It is reasonable, however, to anticipate the 

minimum estimate of approximately 20 percent, given that the 

timing of the closures occurs in seasons of highest bycatch of 

harbor porpoise in their respective areas. It is also reasonable 

to conclude that the continued annual target reductions may be 

accomplished by modifications to the same measures. 

The Council adopted the approach of integrating effort 

reductions for key species of groundfish stocks with harbor 

porpoise bycatch mitigation measures after the first year of 

program implementation. If the measures, or any future approach 

that is adopted, accomplish the harbor porpoise objective without 

reducing gillnet fishing effort sufficiently to reach the 50 

percent effort reduction target, the Council will impose 

additional fishing restrictions. 





A. Northeast Closure Area





This area will be closed to fishing with sink gillnets from 

August 15 through September 13 of each fishing year.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Crumple a sheet of aluminum foil and then heat it 
up. Nothing changes. Now do the same thing with a sheet formed 
from a shape-memory alloy. The crumpled mass unfolds into a 
sheet again. 
  Shape-memory alloys are among the most fascinating of new 
materials for this unique ability to return to their original 
shape when heated, no matter how badly they have been distorted 
at a lower temperature. 
  Until recently, speculation on their potential raced far 
ahead of actual applications. But the alloys are now finding 
widening use in a broad range of fields, from consumer 
electronics to women's clothing to dental prosthetics. 
  Shape-memory alloys are one class of intermetallic 
compounds, 
a special group of two-metal alloys. What makes them unique is 
their molecular structure. When a typical metal is heated or 
cooled, bonding between atoms changes. But in a shape-memory 
alloy, the bonds between adjacent atoms remain very strong. 
  As a result, the material is very elastic and although it 
can 
be deformed below a certain temperature, it returns to its 
original shape when reheated. 
  These two unique properties of shape-memory alloys are being 
utilized in a variety of applications. In England, a 
shape-memory alloy has been used as the hinges for greenhouse 
windows. When the outdoor air reaches a certain temperature, the 
hinges change shape, opening the window in the process. 
  Storage Applications 
  In Japan, shape-memory alloys are being used to help keep 
the 
air dry inside storage units holding chemicals, camera lenses 
and other moisture-sensitive products. A shape-memory alloy is 
used for the spring which controls a door separating the storage 
room from the unit containing the moisture-absorbing desiccant. 
When the desiccant can no longer absorb moisture, a heater 
kicks, triggering the spring to shut the door. With the storage 
area thus protected from exposure to moisture, the desiccant can 
be reconditioned. 
  Consumer-electronics manufacturers are using shape-memory 
alloys to give air conditioners added value. When the air 
conditioner is used to heat the room, a spring made from 
shape-memory alloy contracts, pulling the flaps down so the hot 
air is blown toward the floor. 
  The tremendous elasticity of shape-memory alloys has been 
used to make eyeglass frames and women's brassieres. 
  In the dental field, the alloys are being used for 
artificial-tooth roots. The branches of a tooth root made from a 
shape-memory alloy are straight when the dentist implants the 
root in the jaw bone, but bend when warmed by body temperature. 
As a result, the root becomes firmly secured and more difficult 
to dislodge. Shape-memory alloys are also being used for 
orthodontic braces. 
  The medical field is the site of much applications research. 
One day, shape-memory alloys may be employed to help mend broken 
bones by keeping the fractured parts firmly together. 
  Two types of shape-memory alloys are now in use: a 
nickel-titanium alloy, which accounts for 90&percnt; of all 
present 
applications, and a series of copper-based alloys, such as 
copper-zinc-aluminum. 
  Copper-based alloys are comparatively easy to process and 
therefore cheaper than nickel-titanium alloys, but they loose 
their ``memory'' after around 1,000 heating and cooling cycles. 
In contrast, a nickel-titanium alloy can last for as many as 1 
million cycles. 
  Moreover, this type of alloy does not corrode and is 
biocompatible, so it can be used inside the human body. The job 
now is to simplify the processing steps and to reduce production 
costs.

and 1992. They urged the Council to ask NMFS to conduct ongoing 

surveys in order to better refine the data. 





Response: 



Again, the estimates are based on the best 

scientific information available. NMFS abundance estimates for 

1991 and 1992 are 37,500 (% coefficient of variation (CV)=28.8, 

95% confidence interval (CI)=26,700 to 86,400) and 67,500 (%CV=23.1, 95% CI=32,900 to 104,600), respectively.
The reason for the 

nearly twofold, but statistically insignificant, increase between 

1991 and 1992 is unknown. Although the increase is statistically 

insignificant, it may reflect a real change in abundance due to a 

distribution change or methodological sampling error. Methods to 

investigate this difference were recommended at the February 23&hyph;25 

NEFSC workshop to evaluate the status of harbor porpoise in the 

western North Atlantic. An abundance survey has been recommended 

for 1995. 







Comment: 



A suggestion was made to divide the Northeast 

closure area in half, longitudinally, or simply to make the entire 

area smaller. 







Response: 



The Northeast area proposed for closure from August 

15 through September 13 already represents a compromise forged 

between fishermen and the Council. But concerns still exist that 

animals will move into adjacent areas where vessels may 

concentrate and increase the likelihood of takes, rather than 

reduce that possibility. Also, NMFS survey data indicate that 

harbor porpoise usually frequent the same general areas of the 

Gulf of Maine, but not always at the same time every year. Because 

of this variability, shorter closures in smaller areas could 

result in little or no reduction in bycatch, if animals are not 

present during the closure period. This would result in lost 

fishing time with no benefit. 







Comment: 



Commenters expressed concern about Northeast time 

and area closures that would eliminate fishing in the Schoodic 

Ridge area, a region vital to the ``downeast'' fishermen. 









Response: 



The Council's final decision took into account the 

fact that the time and area plan would be phased in over 4 years. 

During the first year of implementation, the Schoodic Ridge 

fishing grounds will be left open. Further changes to the area 

will be based on the harbor porpoise bycatch estimates derived 

from sea sampling program and other relevant data submitted to the 

Council. 







Comment: 



Commenters from Maine questioned why Jeffreys Ledge, 

an area located off the coasts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire 

that accounts for a relatively high level of bycatch, was being 

left open in the first year of the plan. 







Response: 



The Council's Mid-coast closure area incorporates 

an area known as Jeffreys Basin, but excludes Jeffreys Ledge. In 

past years, the basin area has represented a higher level of 

bycatch than Jeffreys Ledge. Concerns focus on whether the 

displacement of more fishing effort onto Jeffreys Ledge might 

account for a kill rate as high as or potentially higher than, in 

previous years. As with the Northeast area, however, the Council 

considered the boundaries adequate for year one of implementation 

of Framework Adjustment 



#



4. Bycatch of harbor porpoise will be 

monitored and the need to adjust the boundaries can be 

accomplished under the framework system. 







Comment: 



One individual asked for an exemption for small-boat 

operators who fish inshore only, and who are responsible for 

little or no harbor porpoise bycatch. Otherwise, they would 

effectively be excluded from the fishery as of the November 1&hyph;30 

Mid-coast closure because they are too small to fish in offshore 

conditions. Another commenter suggested that these vessels fish 

under the 500-pound (226.8 kg) possession limit for regulated 

species of groundfish. 







Response: 



Harbor porpoise throughout the Gulf of Maine are 

distributed both inshore and offshore and become entangled in 

gillnets, regardless of vessel size. Additionally, all sink 

gillnet vessels fishing under a Federal multispecies permit, 

regardless of where they are fishing, are subject to the porpoise 

bycatch reduction measures. 







Comment: 



Gillnet gear should be given credit, one commenter 

said, for being size-selective and for resulting in discards of 

juvenile finfish. 







Response: 



Once the time and area program has been in place 

(approximately 1 year from the date of implementation), the 

Council will evaluate the impact of the gillnet fishery on the 

mortality of groundfish stocks and develop management measures 

that are appropriate for the gillnet sector. 







Comment: 



Some commenters felt the harbor porpoise bycatch 

reduction program was a mechanism being used by other interests to 

close the sink gillnet fishery. 







Response: 



The Council's measures are designed to minimize 

impacts on the sink gillnet fishery, while at the same time 

achieve the stated harbor porpoise bycatch reduction objectives. 

The Council has held 16 public meetings since its initial 

commitment to incorporate bycatch measures in Amendment 5 and has 

involved the fishing community, conservation groups and interested 

parties in the development of the FMP. 







Comment: 



Several commenters felt it was inappropriate to use 

the harbor porpoise time and area closure plan to protect 

endangered whales. 







Response: 



As part of the Council's obligations under section 

7 of the ESA, a consultation with NMFS is required if a fishery 

affects, either directly or indirectly, endangered or threatened 

species or any designated critical habitat. Because this 

framework adjustment represents a change in management measures 

for a gear type that has interactions with endangered species, the 

Council re-initiated the section 7 consultation developed for 

Amendment 5, identified potential interactions and has addressed 

them in the context of this framework adjustment. 







Comment: 



Many fishermen supported the use of ``pingers,'' sound 

emitting devices that increase an animal's awareness of nets, as a 

bycatch mitigation measure. A suggestion was made to use pingers 

in year 1 of implementation of Amendment 5 in conjunction with 

four-day blocks of time, but with no subsequent expansion of the 

days during which nets would be removed from the water in future 

years.

printed in the West, even the Thai newspapers have spread so 
much divisive news to sow dissension among Cambodians without 
even an iota of truth. For example, they have claimed that 
Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi 
would resign their government portfolios if the Khmer Rouge were 
declared outlaws. 
  Are the Khmer Rouge related in any way to His Highness 
Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi? Are they their 
fathers-in-law or what? 
  Although they have published such a blatant falsehood, no 
buck-toothed people dare accuse them of day-dreaming. Maybe 
these buck-toothed guys are too buck-toothed to do something 
normal persons would do.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], April 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
escort group of Buddha tooth relic to Myanmar [Burma] led by 
Ven. Ming Yang, vice president of The Buddhist association of 
China (BAC) left here for home this afternoon after ending a one 
week visit to Myanmar. 
  The group was seen off by Myanmar Minister for Religious 
Affairs Lieutenant-General Myo Nyunt and officials, Myanmar 
Ambassador to China U Set and Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar 
Liang Feng. 
  The escort group of Buddha's tooth relic to Myanmar arrived 
here on April 20 with the Buddha's tooth relic. 
  To further strengthen the traditional friendship between 
China and Myanmar and between the religious communities of the 
two countries, the sacred tooth of Lord Buddha of China will 
make a temporary residence in Myanmar from April 20 to June 5. 
  During their stay in Myanmar, Ven. Ming Yang and his escort 
group members visited some famous pagodas in Yangon, Mandalay, 
Pagan, Sagaing hill and Pyin-oo-Lwin, and met with chairman 
Sayadaw Abhidhaja Maha Rattha Guru Bhaddanta Sobita and other 
venerable monks 
  With patience and earnestness, many pilgrims waited about 
four hours for their turns to pay homage to the tooth relic at 
the Maha Pasana cave at Kaba Aye Pagoda and nearly 100,000 
pilgrims paid homage to Buddha's tooth relic up to now.

OFFICER GETS REPRIMAND OVER 'TROPHY' TOOTH 




By Associated Press 




CLEARWATER, Fla. 




An officer was reprimanded after a suspect's tooth, knocked out in a scuffle, 
was placed on a wall at the police station as a trophy, authorities said. 


Police Chief Sid Klein reprimanded Sgt. William Goatcher for allowing another 
officer to display the tooth in public for two months. 


The chief said the display exhibited "a clear lack of sensitivity to the 
feelings of others."

There is a band outside the Mid-coast closure area that 

encompasses Jeffreys Ledge and is described relative to the Mid-

coast area as east on 42

&cir;30 N. from the shore to 70

&cir;00 W., north 

along 70

&cir;00 W. to 43

&cir;00 N., on 43

&cir;00 N. to 69

&cir;00 W., then north on 

69

&cir;00 W. to the shore. According to the sea sampling data base, 

harbor porpoise bycatch in this band has been relatively high 

during the last 3 years. Concerns focus on whether a displacement 

of more fishing effort into this region might account for a kill 

rate as high as or potentially higher than in previous years. 

Under provisions of this final rule, the band will remain open, 

but the Council recommended mandatory observer coverage for 

vessels fishing in the area if funds are available. 





D. Open Areas: 





Areas shown on Figure 4 to part 651, but not 

enclosed by the boundary lines described above, would not be 

subject to closure at this time. 

The Council program calls for a 20-percent reduction in the 

Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise bycatch in year 1 of implementation 

of Amendment 5. To ensure continued efforts to reduce the 

bycatch, Amendment 5 states that a Harbor Porpoise Review Team 

(HPRT), appointed by the Council, will evaluate the effectiveness 

of the Council's mitigation measures annually by September 15 of 

each year and, if necessary, recommend changes to ensure that the 

bycatch reduction goals are met. 

Future management measures will be designed to achieve a 

60-percent reduction in the bycatch of harbor porpoise from 

current levels over a 3-year period. Based on a bycatch of 1,300 

animals (a figure that constitutes a rough average of the bycatch 

estimates over the last 2 years), the bycatch in years 1, 2, and 3 

would be reduced to 1,040, 780, and 520 animals, respectively. 

Such a reduction schedule might surpass the goal of reducing 

the harbor porpoise bycatch to a level not to exceed 2 percent of 

the estimates of population abundance and bycatch (39,500 and 

approximately 1,300, respectively). The use of the lower bound of 

the 95-percent confidence interval for the abundance estimate, 

39,500, adds a level of conservatism that in part addresses the 

problem of the confidence intervals surrounding the bycatch 

estimates. As previously discussed, the entire 2 percent bycatch 

cannot be allocated solely to the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet 

fleet. 

A specific target for year 4 will be established by the HPRT 

after consideration of previous targets not met in any given year 

or because of possible increased bycatch reductions required by 

the 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. For 

example, if the 20 percent target is missed in any of the first 

three years, the fourth year allows the flexibility to add that 

portion of the target reductions not achieved in any of the first 

three years to be deferred until the next year or until year four 

of the program. The year-4 target, however, cannot exceed 20 

percent of the total reduction required over the entire 4-year 

period. 





Comments and Responses 





The Council held the first of two meetings required under the 

Amendment 5 framework adjustment process on February 17, 1994. 

Two public hearings were subsequently held on March 9, 1994, in 

Portsmouth, NH, and on March 10, 1994, in Ellsworth, ME. The 

Council approved the closures for the Northeast and Mid-coast 

areas at the second Council meeting held on March 17, 1994. On 

April 6, 1994, the Council adopted boundaries and a 30-day closure 

period for the Massachusetts Bay area. 

In addition to the meetings held within the formal framework 

period, the public was notified of all Marine Mammal Committee 

meetings held between September 1993 and March 1994, for the 

purpose of developing the time and area closure plan. For scoping 

purposes, the issue also was included in the Amendment 5 public 

hearing document and was reviewed at a series of coastwide 

meetings held in the spring of 1993. 



Comments on the Council's proposal were received from Maine 

Congressional Rep. Olympia J. Snowe and the following 

organizations: Cape Ann Gillnetter's Association, Beverly, MA; 

Coonamessett Farm, Falmouth, MA; International Wildlife Coalition, 

East Falmouth, MA; Maine Gillnetters Association, Stonington, ME; 

Massachusetts Netters Association, Marshfield, MA; and the New 

Hampshire Commercial Fishermen's Association, Rye, NH. 





Comment: 



Numbers of fishermen had serious concerns about the 

quality of the data used to determine time and area closures. 

Response: Measures contained in Framework Adjustment 



#



4 are 

based on the best scientific information available. NMFS has 

conducted two population surveys of harbor porpoise abundance in 

the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region. Additionally, bycatch 

estimates have been calculated from observed gillnet trips, based 

on sea sampling data collected since 1989. Since June 1991, 

observers have made trips on roughly 9 percent of the Gulf of 

Maine gillnet trips. All available information on the biology, 

seasonal distribution, abundance and bycatch was reviewed at two 

international workshops convened by the NEFSC in Woods Hole, MA in 

May 1992 and February 1994.

GRIM REPORT ON WHALES 




Two alarming developments emerged from the International Whaling Commission 
meeting in San Diego: 


 -- The stock of whales is lower that the grim earlier assessments had 
predicted, and 


 -- Japan is continuing its defiance of the recommendations of the commission's 
scientific committee with plans for an even larger kill of minke whales in the 
Antarctic under the scientific- research exemption to the whaling moratorium. 


Furthermore, the meeting was marked by new estimates of the appalling kill of 
other sea mammals that suggest an urgent need for the commission to extend its 
work to dolphins and porpoises. Japan killed 39,000 Dall's porpoises in 1988, 
apparently as a substitute for whale meat. An estimated 500,000 dolphins and 
porpoises were killed last year, including those taken by Japanese fishermen, 
thousands more accidentally killed in the nets of American tuna boats and in 
the surface gill nets of Korea, Japan and Taiwan. 


The United States has continued its firm support of the moratorium, and 
continues to have sanctions in place against Japan. The moratorium is intended 
to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of world whale stocks, which some of 
the traditional whaling nations hope will justify a resumption of whaling under 
an international quota system. 


An eight-year study of whale populations presented at the commission meeting 
raised grave questions. The blue whale, earth's largest creature, has declined 
to an estimated 453 compared with an estimated 250,000 before the beginning of 
commercial whaling in the 15th Century. Fin whales have dropped below 4,000, 
compared with a supposed 500,000 before commercial whaling. Only 4,047 humpback 
and 3,059 sperm whales were counted, although the counts may have been 
incomplete. 


The only whale actively hunted now is the minke, whose numbers are in dispute. 
In the last season, Japan took 241, Norway and Iceland fewer than 100 each, all 
under the "scientific research" exemption. Iceland announced it will suspend 
all whaling next year, while Norway announced plans to take 20 and Japan 
proposed 875. Paradoxically, the scientific committee had found the Icelandic 
research useful and valid, while finding the Norwegian and Japanese programs 
without merit. 


At least there was firm commission opposition to Japan's request to resume 
coastal whaling next year. But the Japanese argument at the commission meeting 
that it was the victim of cultural prejudice showed how much hard work lies 
ahead to implement effective whale protection.

F.E. Wimmer named a specimen J.F. Rock collected in 1911 from Kanahaha, Kona, as 



Cyanea arqutidenta,



 which H. St. John later moved to the genus 



Delissea



 (St. John 1959, Wimmer 1943). St. John also named a specimen collected in 1968 from the southern Kona District as 



D. konaensis



 (St. John 1986). The current treatment of the family (Lammers 1988, 1990) considers all of the above species to be synonymous
with 



D. undulata.



 Lammers recognizes three subspecies of 



D. undulata:



 subsp. 



niihauensis,



 subsp. 



kauaiensis,



 and subsp. 



undulata



 (Lammers 1988, 1990). 







Delissea undulata



 of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) is a palm-like tree with unbranched woody stems 2 to 10 meters (m) (6 to 30
feet (ft)) tall. The leaves are long and narrow or elliptic with long petioles and undulate or flat, toothed margins,
about 5 to 21 centimeters (cm) (2 to 8 inches (in)) long and 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) wide. The flowering stalk bears 5 to 20 greenish-white,
slightly down-curved flowers 1.6 to 2.5 cm (0.6 to 1.0 in) long with one or two small knobs on the upper surfaces. The
fruits are ovoid to globose purple berries 0.6 to 1.2 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in) long. The three subspecies of 



D. undulata



 can be distinguished from each other by leaf shape and leaf margin characteristics: subsp. 



kauaiensis



 has ovate leaves with flat, sharply toothed margins; subsp. 



niihauensis



 has leaves with heart-shaped bases and shallow roundly toothed margins; and subsp. 



undulata



 has narrower, lance-shaped leaves with undulating margins and spreading, pointed teeth (Lammers 1988, 1990). The
species 



D. undulata



 is distinguished from closely related species in this genus by its broader leaf bases, larger flowers, and larger
berries (Lammers 1990). 



Historically, 



D. undulata



 is known from Niihau, Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. Subspecies 



kauaiensis



 was collected west of the Hanapepe River on the island of Kauai by A.A. Heller in 1895 and has not been relocated (Hawaii
Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a, Heller 1897, Lammers 1988). Subspecies 



niihauensis



 was collected twice in the 1800's on the island of Niihau and has not been located since (HHP 1991b, Hillebrand 1888,
St. John 1959). Both of these subspecies are considered extinct (HHP 1991a, 1991b; Lammers 1990). 



Delissea undulata



 subsp. 



undulata



 was reported from four valleys of southwestern Maui in the 1800's, and from the Kona region of the island of Hawaii (HHP
1991c1 to 1991c9). This subspecies was observed in 1971 at Puu Lehua and was subsequently thought to be extinct (HHP
1991c6, Lammers 1990). However, one individual plant was discovered on April 24, 1992, at Puu Waawaa, at a previously
unreported location on Hualalai on the island of Hawaii (Jon Giffin, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources
(Hawaii DLNR), 



in litt.



 1993). 







Delissea undulata



 grows primarily in dry and mesic forests at about 1,000 to 1,750 m (3,300 to 5,700 ft) elevation (Lammers 1990; J. Giffin,




in litt.



, 1993). The substrate is a thin organic soil layer over 'a'a or pahoehoe lava (Department of Geography 1983). The only
known individual grows on the brink of a collapsed lava tube at 1070 m (3520 ft) elevation. The vegetation is open 



Sophora chrysophylla



 (mamane)-



Metrosideros polymorpha



 ('ohia) forest with such associated species as 



Santalum ellipticum



 ('iliahi) and 



Acacia koa



 (koa). The endangered species 



Nothocestrum breviflorum



 ('aiea) also is found in the area of the one remaining individual of 



D. undulata.



 Introduced plants in the area include 



Pennisetum clandestinum



 (kikuyu grass), 



Passiflora mollissima



 (banana poka), and 



Senecio mikanioides



 (German ivy) (J. Giffin, 



in litt.



, 1993). 



The greatest immediate threats to the survival of 



D. undulata



 are damage from domestic and feral herbivores and competition with alien plants. Fire, whether started naturally
or by arson, poses a serious threat to the population. The small population size of one individual with its limited
gene pool also comprises a serious threat to this species (J. Giffin, 



in litt.



, 1993).

   SYDNEY


Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the country's largest resources groups,
is proposing to buy a 45 per cent stake in National Consolidated (NCL), the
listed Australian engineering group, for about ADollars 110m (USDollars
84m).
The purchase, which is subject to various approvals, would be the latest in
a series of Australian investments taken by MMC. It already holds stakes in
Ashton Mining, the diamond mining company, and Plutonic Resources, the
goldmining and minerals exploration group.
The seller in this case is Tooth &amp; Co, an investment holding company and
part of the troubled Adsteam group. Tooth currently owns almost 49 of
National Consolidated, and proposes to retain a 3.74 per cent stake if the
MMC sale, at ADollars 1.26 a share, is approved. Adsteam itself owns a
further 17.8 per cent of National Consolidated.
The sale is subject to approval from National Consolidated and Tooth
shareholders, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, and Central Bank
Malaysia. Tooth has also granted MMC an option over 19.9 per cent of
National Consolidated's shares, exercisable if a third party emerges to bid
for NCL and shareholder approval for the Tooth/MMC deal is not forthcoming.
Yesterday, in a statement, MMC said that it was not 'the present intention
of MMC to launch a takeover bid for NCL but, as in the case of its other
large investments in Australian listed companies, to maintain a substantial
long term shareholding'.
The company pulled out of tin mining, previously its core activity, last
year, and has been diversifying activities. NCL returned to profit in
1993-94 after several years of losses, on a reduced sales base of just over
Dollars 200m, having sold its building materials operations in 1993.

 [Commentary by Franz Schoenhuber: "The Media and Political 
Dogs Are Barking -- The Republikaner Caravan Is Moving On"] 
  [Text] We know what our position ise. We know that the 
old parties need a bogeyman to divert attention from their own 
failures. We are convinced that the German people are being 
subjected to foreign dictates. There is a historical reason for 
this. Never before in history has a nation twice suffered 
crushing defeat and humiliation in such a short period of time. 
The Old Testament principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a 
tooth still applies to Germany. 
  German politicians have become toothless over the years. 
Fear of the media, especially directed from the U.S. East 
Coast, has equipped them with an early warning system that 
triggers an appropriate response in the event of danger. 
Exercises in repentance are the order of the day. If there is 
any doubt, Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker leads the 
prayers. Whoever does not want to follow the "American way of 
life" is afraid of being ostracized for considering it corrupt. 
We have a damned duty and responsibility to fall into the arms 
of those who want to turn us into the 51st U.S. state. We are 
also opposed to the kind of double standard that in as short a 
time as possible mobilized half the world against Iraq just 
because oil interests were endangered, but watches passively as 
a people bleed to death on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  We do not want such far-reaching liberalization that we are 
confronted with pornography and violence on television every 
evening. We do not want Germany to become a Harlem. We do not 
want the kind of security that only rich people can afford, with 
watch towers, barbed wire, and private armies. We do not want 
the Mafia, which has been reexported from the United States to 
Italy, to destroy our children with drugs. 
  Mammon is not our god. We believe that the strong should 
help the weak. What we value does not lie in a safe, but in our 
hearts! 
  It was worth struggling for these ideas. We do not want 
Gottfried Benn's merciless statement to become reality: "The 
Occident is not heading for destruction because of totalitarian 
systems or because of spiritual poverty, but because of the 
servility of intelligence vis-a-vis political expediency."
