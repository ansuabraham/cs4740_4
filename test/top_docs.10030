THE FIRST Channel tunnel express train to be seen in Britain emerged from
the tunnel mouth at Folkestone yesterday morning  - crawling behind a French
diesel locomotive that had pulled it through the tunnel, writes Richard
Tomkins.
The electrically powered train, built in France, was unable to make its own
way to British shores because the electrical systems in the tunnel have not
yet been switched on.
A total of 38 Eurostar Channel tunnel express trains are being built by GEC
Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering company, at Pounds 24m apiece. They
will run between London and Paris in three hours when the tunnel opens next
year.
The prototype that arrived yesterday has undergone months of trials in
France and will be tested in England to establish how the trains perform
using the comparatively low-voltage electrical system in use on Network
SouthEast.

The long-delayed launch of train services through the Channel tunnel is to
be postponed again, it was announced yesterday.
Some problems are taking longer than expected to resolve, explained
Euro-tunnel, the company which runs the tunnel. They included hitches in the
hydraulic system and alarm warning lights. 'The systems work, but in some
areas we have not achieved the reliability we want,' the company said. 'In
the hydraulics, for example, we need to make a few adjustments.'
Passenger shuttle services are not therefore expected to start on May 8 as
previously planned. Freight services, previously due to start next month,
may be delayed until April or early May. They are nevertheless scheduled to
start before May 6, when the tunnel will be officially opened by the Queen
and President Francois Mitterrand.
Eurotunnel said the tunnel was structurally sound and no significant
problems had been encountered, but the complexity of the commissioning
programmes had meant some tests had had to be repeated and others had been
rescheduled.
'We want to offer a completely reliable service and we thought it was better
to guarantee this even if it meant a slight delay before opening,' said Mr
Christian Zbylut, director of Eurotunnel's freight operations at Calais.
He said the problems that had been revealed during tests were usual in such
a high-technology project. 'On one locomotive there are about 500 tests
which have to be performed,' he said.
The Pounds 10bn project was originally planned to open in May last year but
has been hit by recurring delays. Control was handed over to Eurotunnel by
Transmanche Link, the contracting consortium, last December.
The Road Haulage Association said it was disappointed by the delay, but did
not believe that large numbers of road hauliers had intended to use the
tunnel from the outset. Those affected would re-route shipments to ferry
services.
CTL, a freight company that had planned to run two trains a day through the
tunnel to Italy starting on March 14, said it was better for Eurotunnel to
delay the launch so that when it did start it could provide a reliable
service.
Eurotunnel yesterday offered refunds to passengers who had planned to travel
through the tunnel in May. Passengers who are able to delay their journeys
can use their tickets when the tunnel opens.

the visible movement of French armed police on UK soil.
The UK view is that unrestricted movement could lead to the danger of
weapons being used, which might at the same time trigger complicated legal
disputes.
The Home Office is also thought to be reluctant to fuel the debate in the UK
about whether British police should be more widely armed.
The French Ministry of the Interior blames the disagreement on cultural
differences. For the French police carrying guns is traditional and there is
some resistance at a political level to cede too much to the British over a
project that cuts across national boundaries.
A Home Office spokesman described Tuesday's talks as 'inconclusive' although
'both sides are moving in the right direction'.
He added: 'This is an issue that needs to be thrashed out before the Channel
tunnel becomes fully operational.'
A further meeting at official level has been fixed for the end of the month.
Some French and British police officers fear privately that the guns problem
is becoming a political football because of an issue of national
sovereignty.
They say that co-operation between the two forces involved in the Channel
tunnel project is good and open to flexible arrangements.

   LONDON, PARIS


Want to buy 200km of second-hand steel pipe or 110km of copper earthing
cable? Maybe you are in the market for a fleet of used excavators or a
crawler-crane capable of lifting 200 tonnes? One careful owner, and it must
all go.
Vast amounts of civil engineering machinery and surplus materials left over
from building the Channel tunnel, which opens officially on May 6, are
attracting possible buyers from Malaysia, Denmark, Abu Dhabi and the US.
Some 85 per cent of the project's second-hand equipment has already been
sold, raising more than Pounds 30m for Eurotunnel, the operator, and
Transmanche, the consortium of five British and five French contractors
which designed and built the tunnel.
Still for sale is one of the 8.72-metre diameter tunnel-boring machines, the
biggest of some eight machines used to cut the 50km-tunnel linking Britain
and France.
The machine, built in Glasgow by Howden Group, cost Pounds 7.5m and could
fetch up to Pounds 2.5m on the second-hand market, according to agents Henry
Butcher, who are handling the British end of the sale.
Possible purchasers include builders of the proposed Channel tunnel rail
link between London and the Kent coast. Other equipment may be bought by
construction companies building London Underground's Jubilee Line extension.
The agents have already sold a smaller tunnelling machine to build a
stormwater drainage system at Brighton.
Other tunnel-boring machines, which met mid-Channel, will remain entombed
under the seabed. It would cost too much to dismantle and remove them. One
of the French machines used to bore a section of tunnel from the French
landward side is to be exhibited at the Eurotunnel terminal near Calais.
Another may be shipped to Britain to be exhibited.
Mr Peter Harriman, a Henry Butcher partner, says the agents have raised more
than Pounds 16m from British sales. Purchasers have included tunnellers
building the Boston metro in the US and the 18-km Storebaelt link in Denmark
who have bought locomotives and muck wagons.
A Hong Kong developer building hospitals in Malaysia paid Pounds 500,000 for
desalination plants previously used in the cooling system during
construction of the Channel tunnel. A 200-tonne crawler-crane was sold to
Abu Dhabi. Others were sold to the US, Singapore and Portugal, raising
Pounds 2.5m, said Mr Harriman.
Mr Philippe Laboise, cost control and administration manager for the French
works, says French sales have recovered about 12 per cent of the value.

A large-scale evacuation involving 1,000 Channel tunnel employees, their
spouses and children is to be carried out just before the tunnel opens for
business next March.
Mr Edward Ryder, UK head of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, said
yesterday the plan was to test whether Channel tunnel trains could be
evacuated rapidly in the case of a fire. The test will simulate the
evacuation of a fully loaded train either through the central service tunnel
or by train on the other main rail track.
Car shuttles on the cross-Channel trains, once evacuated, are designed to
contain a fire for 30 minutes, long enough for the train to reach the end of
the tunnel, Mr Ryder said at the presentation of the authority's annual
report.
The main gas to be used to extinguish fires, halon 1301, is to be phased out
from 1995 under an international agreement on greenhouse gases and a
substitute will have to be found. Mr Ryder said Eurotunnel had enough stocks
to last 10 years.
Mr Ryder did not rule out the possibility that tests of more complex parts
of tunnel equipment might lead to the opening being further delayed. But he
added: 'We are confident that the design and concept of the project ought to
be able to work safely. Once you are inside, you will be safer than you were
on the journey to the tunnel.'
Tests of the tunnel and its equipment will continue until the opening. Tests
on the effectiveness of the ventilation system cannot be completed until
trains are running.
The risk of an earthquake damaging the tunnel has been assessed and it has
been shown capable of withstanding shock waves equal to those of the worst
earthquake to hit southern England, in 1580.

A ribbon of Calais lace stretched between two high-speed trains was cut by
the heads of state of Britain and France yesterday to mark the official
opening of the Channel tunnel.
The Queen and President Francois Mitterrand stepped off the trains which had
brought them to Calais from their respective capitals to mark the end of 200
years of on-off plans and seven years of tough and often dangerous
tunnelling.
The Pounds 10bn project forms the first man-made link between the two
nations. The cost of the project, one of the largest and most ambitious
engineering feats undertaken, has risen to double the original estimates.
In Britain the day had begun with the official opening by the Queen of the
Waterloo international terminal. The Queen then boarded a train for the
32-mile trip through the tunnel. The Eurostar train also carried Mr John
Major, a host of other ministers and rail officials.
The whole journey including the start through Kent took 1 hr 45 mins. The
train increased its speed as it swooped into the tunnel at Folkestone. Apart
from the darkened tunnel walls flashing past at up to 100mph, the 30-minute
journey through the tunnel itself was marked only by a slight increase in
noise from the air conditioning system.
On arrival at the Calais terminal, the Eurostar train nosed up to its
counterpart which had brought President Mitterrand and French dignitaries. A
French military band struck up before the ribbon cutting.
President Mitterrand had set off from Paris for the ceremony after
inaugurating a new rail terminal at Gare du Nord Station. The train carrying
him and prime minister Edouard Balladur was decked with French and British
flags.
The French president, the son of a railway stationmaster, said in a
newspaper interview that the tunnel helped 'anchor the construction of
Europe', bringing it forward 'more than any speeches'.
Speaking at Calais, President Mitterrand said he felt 'very emotional and
proud'. He added: 'After two centuries of dreams, today is the conclusion.'
He said the tunnel was one of the century's most prestigious endeavours. Its
opening would strengthen the European Union and the creation of a single
market.
President Mitterrand praised Lady Thatcher for her part in sanctioning the
building of the tunnel when prime minister. Lady Thatcher, sitting in the
front row among hundreds of dignitaries, smiled as she was singled out.
The Queen, noting that yesterday was the first time that British and French
heads of state had met without travelling by boat or aircraft, said the
tunnel demonstrated the strength of relations between the two countries.
Speaking in French to an audience of more than 1,000 guests, the Queen
referred to the 'violent fluctuations' in Anglo-French relations through the
ages. But the tunnel, she said, was an example of 'a successful combination
of French elan and British pragmatism'.
She congratulated the engineers and entrepreneurs who had built it, saying
that they had 'rejoined what nature had separated for some 40m years'.
After lunch, the Queen travelled back through the tunnel on board Le
Shuttle, one of the trains that will carry cars between Paris and London in
three hours. She was joined in her Rolls Royce Phantom VI by the French
president.
At Folkestone, Eurotunnel co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton told the two heads
of state: 'It is my proud honour and privilege to confirm that the Channel
tunnel is built and ready for service.
'In a year or two the journey you have both just made will be an everyday
experience for millions of people.'
But Sir Alastair said people must not forget the 10 people who had died
working on the project.
Mr Denis Filer, president of the Engineering Council, said: 'Our
congratulations go to the engineers of all disciplines who have accomplished
what must be rated as one of the world's greatest engineering achievements.
It is a proud day for British engineering.'
The tunnel system was today closed to the public - once again returned its
recent ritual of continuous safety testing.
A start-up date for passenger services has yet to be set. Freight trains may
start using the tunnel as early as next week if safety clearance is obtained
 -but passenger services will probably have to wait until July.

Mr Philippe Montagner, TML vice-president, told shareholders that
construction of the tunnel was not nearly finished, in spite of what
Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator said.
He said that more than a year was needed to make software and to carry out
tests.
'The installations as such are on the verge of being finished but that is
not the case for software or tests, and in the best of cases over another
year of work is still needed today,' Mr Montagner said.
He said talks between Eurotunnel and TML were blocked and there was no
agreement on costs, the opening date or financing.
TML was ready to negotiate if Eurotunnel made an offer that could serve as a
basis of negotiation, he said, adding that a 1995 opening would only be
possible if 'perfect co-operation' between all parties in the project was
reached.
TML favoured a phased opening even if this was not planned in the initial
contract, he said.
Eurotunnel said it was sticking by a recent statement that, if it ccould
count on the co-operation of its contractors, the tunnel should be ready to
open in 1994.

SNCF and British Rail, the French and UK railway operators, may demand
compensation from Eurotunnel for the delay in the start of freight services
through the Channel Tunnel, according to Mr Alain Poinssot, head of SNCF's
freight division.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Ian Brown, his British Rail
counterpart, Mr Poinssot said that the delay in the launch of freight
operations, which were due to have started yesterday, entailed significant
costs both in terms of lost revenues and the uncertainty facing clients.
Mr Poinssot said that the loss of earnings was being evaluated by his
company's lawyers. British Rail and SNCF are already involved in a dispute
with Eurotunnel concerning the fees for use of the Channel Tunnel rail link.
Eurotunnel has not set a firm timetable for its services following last
month's announcement of delays due to the complex commissioning and testing
process. The official opening of the Channel Tunnel will go ahead as planned
on May 6.
Despite the desire for compensation, Mr Poinssot said that the delay in
services should be put into context. 'The tree should not obscure the
forest,' he said, describing freight services through the Tunnel as
'revolutionary'. Mr Brown estimated that by 1996-1997, the annual volume of
freight passing through the tunnel would amount to more than 6m tonnes.
About 60 per cent of this would be represented by container traffic.
Automobile shipments are expected to account for 25 per cent of total
freight.
According to Mr Brown, the work needed to prepare for the launch of Channel
Tunnel freight services had been completed last weekend. He said that
services would be expanded progressively, starting with 10 trains per day in
each direction and increasing to 35 trains each way by 1995-1996.
Mr Brown said that the launch of freight traffic services through the Tunnel
was of particular importance to British Rail. 'The tunnel is a 50km journey,
but it joins the UK's 15,000km network to the 240,000km continental rail
network,' he said, adding that it would provide an important stimulus to
demand for rail freight.
British Rail and SNCF have set up a series of joint ventures to manage and
market their Channel Tunnel freight services. British Rail has also adapted
parts of its network, including rebuilding 90 bridges between London and the
Channel Tunnel, to allow the smooth passage of freight trains to the
continental network.

The official opening of the Channel Tunnel later this year promises to help
revitalise the north-west regions of Belgium, even though the country's
biggest ports will suffer a loss of traffic.
The chambers of commerce in Veurne and Courtrai, along with the West
Flanders Regional Development Authority in Bruges, are gearing up to become
part of what they refer to as the 'new European Metropolitan Area.'
This takes in the Nord-Pas de Calais in France, Western Flanders and Hainaut
in Belgium, and Kent in the UK.
The potential for this region is enormous. According to Mr Anthony Vande
Candelare, an urban planner who made a study of the influence of the Channel
Tunnel on the west of Belgium and the North of France: 'Overnight, the
Belgian coast and the North of France will become the centre of Europe.'
Mr Jo Libeer, managing director of the Courtrai chamber of commerce, is
equally optimistic about the likely impact on the area of the tunnel.
'With the TGV and the chunnel this region, which was sort of in the corner
of Europe, will now be in the middle of a new developing area,' he says.
This is no bad thing for Belgium. In its last economic survey of the
country, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the
Belgian economy had deteriorated 'progressively' since the 1980s. 'And over
the last 10 to 12 months it has taken a distinct turn for the worse.'
Furthermore, Flanders, the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of
the tunnel, has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than
in Wallonia and the Brussels region. The unemployment rate, which in 1990
was 9.5 per cent in Flanders has risen to 13 per cent.
The Belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are
two main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western
Flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the
tunnel-opening in Calais; and secondly tourism. To benefit fully, however, a
crucial 7km stretch of the E40 European motorway between Veurne and the
French border has yet to be completed.
Once this is done it will be possible to drive from Russia to England
without leaving a motorway, says Mr Philippe Claerhout, chairman of the
Veurne chamber of commerce and industry. Fortunately, plans to complete the
stretch have been agreed and it should be open some time next year.
On the downside, the Westhoek region is badly placed to benefit from rail
transport.
'Even after the doubling of the tracks and electrification of the railway
line between Ghent and De Panne, we will still be a remote corner,' says Mr
Claerhout.
Furthermore, Belgium's biggest ports are expecting traffic loads to fall, as
freight and passengers are directed towards Calais. Worst affected will be
Ostend and Zeebrugge, two ports hoping to hold their own by concentrating on
links with ports in the north of England.
Nonetheless, the improved, if imperfect, transport communications of the
West Flanders region are apparently paying off. Mr Geert Sanders, who works
for the Regional Development Authority of West Flanders, says there is
already evidence that the region's enhanced communications are attracting
new businesses. For example, Baronie, a Dutch chocolate company, is opening
a new base in the southern part of West Flanders.
There is, however, a danger that Belgium will not make the most of the
commercial opportunities - 'we will try to attract new industry, but our
region is very small and our industrial zones are full,' says Mr Ludo
Verstraete, of the Veurne chamber of commerce. The Belgian authorities have
dragged their feet over decisions to dedicate new areas, he says.
The other main focus for development is tourism. As Mr Claerhout says: 'We
need to convince people from other countries that it is worth their while to
stop in Westhoek at the time of their journey through the North of Europe to
England.'
The potential is there. West Flanders is home to some of the best-known
World War One battlefields, and promoters of the region insist that its
large, open green spaces will, when properly developed, attract foreign
visitors. But once again, there is a danger that Belgium will miss out. It
has been slower to develop the tourist potential of the Channel Tunnel than
France.
Around Calais, a commercial and leisure centre, hotels and activity parks,
known as 'La Cite de L'Europe', are springing up while Lille is home to
Euralille, a similar development. As Mr Verstraete of the Veurne chamber of
commerce says: 'Tourism is very important . . . we really have to develop
our hotels and tourist infrastructure.'
But the biggest advantages for Belgium will come from close co-operation
between the national and federal authorities and their French and UK
counterparts. In a Europe without frontiers, this will be the most effective
way of benefiting from the the Channel Tunnel.

admitted: 'There were several times when I thought we might not make it.
'One of the worst moments was when, with water still pouring through tiny
fissures in the roof of the tunnel, we had to decide whether the
modifications we had made to the machines would be sufficient to let us
proceed. Fortunately, they worked.'
Since then engineers have gone on to break a number of records in the course
of digging about 150km, in three adjoining tunnels, removing more than 20m
tonnes of spoil and building the world's largest undersea tunnel.
The tunnel was just a beginning. The terminals at Folkestone in Kent and
Sangatte near Calais in northern France represented two of Europe's biggest
building projects. The French site is equivalent in size to Heathrow.
The tunnel is one of the world's most sophisticated transport systems
including more than 200km of track in the two running tunnels which are
separated by the central service tunnel.
There is computer-controlled signalling as well as monitoring and override
devices along the track and in trains to assist the managers of the new
railway. These will operate from control towers at each end of the tunnel,
either of which can operate the system on its own. Information is carried
through miles of fibre-optic cable capable of handling 700m pieces of data
per second.
Power for the overhead railway will be drawn from the British and French
national grids from two sub-stations at each end of the tunnel. Either of
these can operate singly.
Stiff safety requirements, in the wake of London Underground's fire at Kings
Cross and the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in Zeebrugge harbour,
have helped increase the project's cost and added to delays.
Mr Edward Ryder, UK head of the inter-governmental Channel tunnel safety
authority, said this week that a full-scale evacuation test, involving 1,000
Channel tunnel employees and their families, will be conducted before
commercial services can start.
He could not rule out further delays, but said: 'We are confident that the
design and concept of the project ought to be able to work safely. Once you
are inside, you should be safer than you were on the journey to the tunnel.'

BRITISH RAIL will have no freight locomotives capable of pulling trains
through the Channel tunnel when it opens late next year, it emerged
yesterday.
Delivery of the 46 electric locomotives being built for Channel tunnel
freight services has been held up because design modifications have become
necessary.
As a stop-gap measure French national railways (SNCF) has agreed to adapt a
number of its electric locomotives so that they can pick up freight trains
at Folkestone, near the British end of the tunnel, and pull them through.
This will be the first time that French locomotives have gone into regular
service on British tracks.
As a result of this arrangement BR will still be able to offer an
international freight train service when the tunnel opens by using existing
diesel locomotives to run freight trains to the tunnel before handing them
over to the French.
The development will anger people living near the freight routes because
diesel locomotives are much noisier than electric ones. Many of the freight
trains will travel at night.
The need for locomotive and crew changes will also jeopardise BR's ability
to fulfil the journey times it has promised its international freight
customers.
The freight locomotives are being built by Brush Traction, part of the
Hawker Siddeley engineering group which was taken over last year by BTR, the
industrial conglomerate.
BR's Railfreight Distribution subsidiary said modifications had become
necessary because of difficulties in accommodating all the equipment needed
to cope with different voltages and signalling systems in Britain, the
tunnel and France.
The delay is the latest in a series of embarrassing setbacks for BR in the
delivery of its Channel tunnel rolling stock. It seems unlikely that any
passenger trains will be ready for at least six months after the tunnel
opens, and the sleeper trains will not be delivered until 1995.
BR said no new delivery schedule had been set for the freight locomotives,
but it had made contingency plans for the first six months of Channel tunnel
operations.

The Channel tunnel, the first land link between Britain and France since the
ending of the Ice Age 11,000 years ago, will have a profound impact on
travel patterns and the British psyche. It is also expected to have a
considerable influence on the location plans of business.
The tunnel should be able to offer a degree of convenience and reliability
which the ferries, subject as they are to the vagaries of the weather,
cannot match. Despite the improvements in the quality and the frequency of
ferry and airline services in recent years, the need to board a ship or take
an aeroplane has meant that the Channel has remained a psychological barrier
to business.
The creation of a land link between Britain and France should change all
that, though the tunnel is just one element in the rapidly evolving European
business environment. The creation of the single European market and changes
in manufacturing and distribution patterns also have an important influence
on a company's location decisions.
The tunnel's opening will have both a regional impact - on location
decisions in south-east England and north-east France - and also a broader
European impact on companies with a scale of operations and a location
strategy which embraces the entire continent.
At a regional level, location decisions will be influenced by the
development activity which is under way along the rail links between the
tunnel and London and Paris respectively. In Kent, Ashford has high hopes of
becoming a growth centre while across the Channel ambitious developments are
under way in Lille.
Ashford's position seems assured following the government's decision to
route Channel tunnel trains through the centre of the town rather than
bypassing it to the north. This should provide a boost for the new
international railway station currently being built in the centre of the
town.
But elsewhere along the route of the Channel tunnel rail link, the delays
and uncertainties which have surrounded the project have held back property
developments, according to Mr Kevin Lee, a property researcher at chartered
surveyors St Quintin.
Waterloo is the site of an impressive new international terminal but
completion of the Channel tunnel rail link in 2002 will shift the main
London terminus to St Pancras. The prospect of this move has left companies
uncertain as to the best location for fast Channel tunnel connections.
Similar uncertainty reigns over the site of another intermediate station on
the route with three contenders in the ring. Stratford in east London,
Rainham in Essex and Ebbsfleet in Kent are all seeking to win approval for
ambitious property developments though it is likely that only one will be
chosen. Too many stops on the high speed link would reduce the value of
building the link in the first place.
In stark contrast to this delay in the UK, the French government has pressed
ahead with the construction of a high speed line linking Calais with Paris
via Lille. Lille, which is now only an hour from Paris by train a grande
vitesse, is developing Euralille, a sizeable office and retail project on
the site of its recently completed TGV station.
On the broader, European scale, the vastly improved rail freight links
between, for example, the north of England and Italy, will clip hours, if
not days, off shipment times across Europe. This can be expected to
influence the location decisions of businesses with manufacturing plant
spread around Europe.
By the same token, rapid passenger journey times between London, Paris and
Brussels may prompt multinational corporations to rethink their decision on
the location of main or branch offices. Even before the high-speed rail link
is completed between the tunnel and London, through journey times should
prove very competitive with the airlines.
When the tunnel is finally open for business it will offer four principal
services to the traveller or the freight operator. Freight will travel
through the tunnel on long-distance services carrying containers, swap
bodies and trailers or on shuttles
The shuttles will carry trucks between Folkestone and Calais but the
long-distance services will run to a wide range of destinations throughout
Europe.
London to Madrid should be possible in 36 hours and Manchester to Mannheim
in 24 hours. In the absence of the delays associated with rail freight
shipments across the Channel by ferry, through journeys by train should take
only half as long as the equivalent road journey, according to calculations
by the organisations selling rail space.
Railfreight Distribution, British Rail's freight arm responsible for
container shipments, expects the opening of the tunnel to increase train
freight volumes from 2m tonnes a year to 6.5m tonnes after two years.
In the meantime, passenger services will also consist of through services,
initially between London, Paris and Brussels, and of car shuttles operating
between Folkestone and Calais.
The opening of the tunnel will make it easier for multinational companies to
include the UK in the rationalisation of their distribution operations. Many
companies have been moving away from national distribution centres - which
involve considerable amounts of inventory - towards continent-wide
distribution operations.
'Because the Channel tunnel provides a more effective link with Europe it
creates the option for distribution centres to serve the whole of north-
west Europe, including the UK,' says Professor James Cooper, director of the
Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Transportation.
This may mean that companies which at present have a UK distribution centre
in the Midlands will consider relocating to northern France or the Benelux
countries. However, such a move would not be without its problems because
supplying the Scottish and Irish markets would be more difficult.
Creating Europe-wide distribution centres may also run into the problem that
different national markets may have their own technical, language and
packaging requirements which reduce the scope for cutting back on inventory.
Delays to the opening of Channel tunnel services have proved a distraction
from the benefits that the tunnel will eventually bring. If it can show it
is able to provide a reliable, high-quality service it will become an
important factor in location decisions.

THE TRACK is laid, the platforms are in place, overhead power lines have
been erected and the first trains have been run between Britain and France.
The Channel tunnel has arrived.
Most of the construction and electrical installation has been completed
apart from the odd bit of concreting, painting, landscaping and, most
important, the fitting-out of the control towers. Commercial services are
due to start next year.
The terminals - at Coquelles in northern France and Folkestone in Kent  -
look much as they will when public services are running, down to the
foundations and overhead gantries for the toll booths.
The main structures, including control towers and amenity and rest areas,
have been completed. Facilities for customs and immigration have been
provided, even though it is not clear what border controls will be required
following the removal of trade barriers between European Community
countries.
The electricity sub-station at the Folkestone terminal which will provide
power - using French electricity - is partially operating.
Hiring and training of train crews and traffic controllers started last
year. They will be expected to speak fluent English and French. Even
toll-booth operators will attend a two-week language course.
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, has hired 1,100 of the 2,650
full-time staff it will need. There will be about the same numbers of
British and French workers, with 5 per cent drawn from other nationalities.
Some big problems remain. The system has to be tested thoroughly before
Eurotunnel can receive an operating licence from a specially established
Franco-British inter-governmental commission.
Full-scale fire and evacuation tests will have to be conducted underground.
Managers will have to be satisfied that control and signalling systems will
work properly when connected up and that procedures for loading and
unloading vehicles on shuttle waggons will not delay services.
Passenger shuttles, each carrying up to 120 cars and 800 passengers, are
expected to run every 15 minutes at peak times. The 50km journey will take
about 35 minutes, at a maximum speed of 130kph.
There will also be mainline passenger and freight trains run by BR and SNCF,
the British and French rail networks, which could mean trains entering and
leaving the tunnels every three minutes.
Delivery of locomotives and wagons has already been delayed. A dispute over
costs between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link, the consortium of five
British and five French construction companies building the Pounds 8bn-plus
project, could delay further commissioning and testing.
The opening date, originally planned for May, has been put back to December
and Eurotunnel says it could open either side of Christmas. Some
construction companies say it may not open until March or even later next
year.
No matter who wins in the row over costs, the system is built. Even in the
unlikely event that Eurotunnel failed, somebody would take over the project.
All that is needed is the passengers and the cars and history will have been
made.

Channel Tunnel presents exporters and freight hauliers with an imposing new
transport medium, but the extent to which cross-Channel freight patterns
will be altered in the short-to-medium term is subject to keen debate.
These patterns will be affected by a number of factors such as transit times
through the Channel Tunnel, relative freight rates, reliability of services
and the extent to which road hauliers switch from ferry services to the
Channel Tunnel's Le Shuttle HGV service.
A survey released in March by truck maker Scania suggests that most British
hauliers do not know how the Channel Tunnel works and have yet to be
convinced of its competitive advantages.
The delayed opening of freight services has helped the tunnel's competitors
such as the ferry operators, who are already restructuring and trying to
improve cost-effectiveness.
According to Brian Rees of Stena Freight Lines, if Eurotunnel, the tunnel
operator, offers 'a good product and comparable rates to haulage firms, I
think they will maybe take about a fifth of the freight market.
'But freight transport is a finely tuned operation and it will take the
tunnel a while to gain experience. It is going to be several years yet
before we can judge the effect of the Channel Tunnel because it will
progressively build up capacity.'
A concern of Colin Beaumont, divisional manager of the freight industry's
professional body, the British International Freight Association (Bifa), is
that Eurotunnel and the ferry operators may become embroiled in a price war
 -with no winners. 'As far as our members are concerned, it will be a
question of trying out the service - its novelty value - the question of
price and quality of service. Whether or not it is successful in freight
movement, only time will tell.'
But Eurotunnel and the ferry companies tend to talk down the prospect of a
freight price war. Eurotunnel's freight director, Christian Zbylut, is
adamant that Eurotunnel is not going to enter into a price war as the tunnel
is a unique transport system which cannot be compared with a ferry service.
'We are not aiming for 100 per cent market share. That would be damaging',
says Mr Zbylut.
He argues that competition needs to remain in the short-sea (specialised
freight crossing) sector, but he says there will be no space for all the
current cross-Channel operators, which include the ferry companies. 'Some
might have to redeploy on other routes or they might face serious financial
consequences.' Eurotunnel is, he says, aiming at 25 per cent of the total
cross-Channel ro-ro (roll-on roll-off) market and at 9m tonnes on its Le
Shuttle service for HGVs at the end of 1995.
The British Road Haulage Association (BRHA), however, remains sceptical
about the latter figure and says that 'it remains to be seen whether that
target is realised. We are not privy to the information on which it is
based.'
The total volume of freight moved in and out of mainland Britain by hauliers
in 1992, including movements between Scotland and Northern Ireland,
according to the Department of Transport (DoT) amounted to around 52m
tonnes. HGV and trailer movements are usually measured in units. In 1992,
according to the DoT, about 2.83m units were moved in cross-Channel haulage
traffic.
Stena says it is not worried about the Channel Tunnel, arguing that extra
freight capacity will increase overall market volume. The Channel Tunnel
could survive just by taking business from the airlines and ferry companies,
says Stena. It must create its own market as well.
As far as short-sea freight operators are concerned, Ipswich based Geest
North Sea Line sees the Channel Tunnel as a complementary transport medium
to its own shipping operations. 'Our intention is that we will use the
tunnel if the price is right,' says UK general manager Perry Glading.
Longer-term, some see the tunnel creating two distinct freight patterns
between the UK and continental Europe. While short-sea operators and ferry
companies are still expected to dominate north European routes into such
areas as Germany and Scandinavia - especially from Hull, where ferries in
particular are gearing up to faster transit times and improved loading and
unloading services - the tunnel is set to become the main conduit for
France, the Benelux countries, Italy and a range of southern European
locations.
Eurotunnel's Mr Zbylut, however, believes the tunnel will attract
pan-European traffic from a broader spectrum of countries and UK regions.
Geest's Mr Glading reiterates that speed of transport through the tunnel is
a vital for distance traffic.
'The Channel Tunnel will come into its own in three or four years time -
that is when manufacturers and buyers realise that the tunnel can cut their
stock levels and enforce quicker re-stocking, which means more money to
them.'
Ferry operators query whether speed will be essential. Stena's Mr Rees
argues that the 45 minutes or so that the tunnel saves in time is
'irrelevant' on the longer routes. But the tunnel has advantages over the
ferries. As Eurotunnel's Mr Zbylut points out, the ferries are sometimes
unable to run because of bad weather.
The tunnel is also seen by Mr Zbylut as a spur for intermodal (combined)
transport between road, rail, sea and canal transport media. Both the UK
government and the EU are committed to increasing the volume of intermodal
trade by encouraging the building of more intermodal terminals. At the
moment 90 per cent of freight traffic in the EU is still carried by road.

   LONDON, PARIS


A SUGGESTION that the UK and French governments appoint an independent
mediator to try to resolve the conflict between Eurotunnel and its
contractors over the opening date of the Channel tunnel has been discussed
by the two countries.
The UK transport department confirmed that the suggestion had been raised by
French officials, but said the UK government had no plans to appoint a
mediator. Any such appointment would be a matter for the Bank of England to
decide rather than government.
Contractors are seeking substantial additional payments to cover the cost of
building the tunnel which, including interest payments, has risen from
Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to approaching Pounds 10bn.
The contractors' claims are already being considered by an independent
disputes panel.
The initiative proposed by the French would seek to get Eurotunnel and its
contractors to agree an opening date rather than try to resolve the payments
issue.
Contractors have said that the project, which had been due to open in May
this year, will not open until next summer unless agreement can be reached.
Eurotunnel in Paris yesterday confirmed that it was in discussions with the
French government over the appointment of a separate mediator to try to
resolve the conflict over the opening date.
The company said the idea of a mediator - or a Monsieur de Bons Offices -
had come from the government. Eurotunnel said it supported the initiative.
