LONDON is once again to have its own panoramic viewing platform. But, unlike
the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building, London's look-out point is miles
away from its most notable monuments.
One Canada Square, the steel-clad, 50-storey centrepiece of London
Docklands' Canary Wharf and the tallest building in the UK, is opening its
top floor to the public.
The decision to allow visitors has been taken to 'generate and maintain
interest in the Docklands', according to the administrators who were
appointed to the project in May.
At 800ft, the tower is 200ft higher than its nearest UK rival, the National
Westminster Tower in the City of London. On a clear day, the view from the
top can stretch for 30 miles.
Visitors will be charged Pounds 3 a person, but after additional security
and ticketing costs, this will do little to help the finances of the
project, which has debts estimated at Pounds 700m.
It will provide the first opportunity in nearly 20 years to visit the top of
the UK's tallest building. The 580ft Post Office tower (now the BT tower),
which held the record until the NatWest tower was built in 1980, has been
closed to the public since 1973, when a bomb exploded in the restaurant.
The Canary Wharf tower will be the tallest office building that can be
visited in Europe, since Frankfurt's 841ft 6in Messeturm is off limits to
visitors. However, an even loftier view is available from the the
iron-framed, 985ft 11in Eiffel Tower in Paris.
The tallest buildings in the US, the Sears Roebuck Building in Chicago and
the World Trade Center and Empire State Building in New York, also court
visitors. The world's tallest tower remains the 1,815ft CN Tower in Toronto,
while the UK's highest structure is the 1,265ft ITN mast in Lincolnshire.
The Canary Wharf tower will be open on Saturdays and Sundays, from 10am to
5pm, from September 12. On that weekend, the Docklands Light Railway will,
unusually, be open as it coincides with the European Oyster and Seafood
Fair, organised by the London Docklands Development Corporation.

TRUMP'S PLAN FOR AMBASSADOR SITE 




It would be spectacular if Donald Trump actually does build the world's tallest 
skyscraper on the Ambassador Hotel property (Part A, Jan. 14). 


At first I agreed with Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that Trump's proposed 
building would be inappropriate and out of scale for that area. 


But after thinking about it, it occurs to me that the Eiffel Tower is certainly 
"out of scale" in its Paris neighborhood; the Empire State Building was "out of 
scale" when it was built more than a half century ago, and isn't that Tower in 
Pisa "out of scale"? And weren't these buildings the object of scorn, ridicule 
and opposition when first proposed? Yet, Paris, New York and Pisa just wouldn't 
be the same without them. 


The world's tallest building wouldn't be just another office building; it would 
be an attraction for the people of Los Angeles and tourists from around the 
world. That means far more tax dollars and jobs than another Arco twin-tower 
office complex which would contain the same number of square feet of office 
space. 


I believe that if Trump is serious, Los Angeles should encourage him to build 
our "Eiffel Tower" on Wilshire Boulevard.

EIFFEL CLIMBERS TOP OFF 100-YEAR FETE 




From Associated Press 




PARIS 




Champagne flowed, confetti fluttered and 21 guns fired to salute a troupe of 
perspiring actors who climbed 1,710 steps to the top of the Eiffel Tower today 
for the centennial of the Parisian landmark. 


Balloons and a brass band added to the festivities, in which the 30 huffing and 
puffing performers followed in the footsteps of Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. On 
March 31, 1889, he marked the completion of what was then the world's tallest 
tower by climbing 1,000 feet to the top and unfurling a blue, white and red 
flag. 


For the centennial celebration, the three levels of the pig-iron tower were 
transformed into outdoor cafes soaring above Paris in bloom: Fuchsia dogwoods 
marked the path to the Palais Chaillot across the Seine, rectangular beds of 
yellow, red and purple lined the Champs de Mars. 




Stick-on Sideburns 


Tables overflowed with hundreds of invited guests who sipped champagne served 
by gracious waiters in black vests, white aprons and stick-on mutton-chop 
sideburns. 


Television monitors scattered around the periphery of the tables tracked the 
progress of the actors up the stairs. 


Not everyone who started at the foot of the tower a century ago with the 
energetic 55-year-old engineer made it to the top. Some were too pooped to go 
beyond the first level. One man, suffering from vertigo, had himself 
blindfolded at the second level and finished the climb. 


"This is where I get off, thank goodness," said 67-year-old actor Pierre 
Pauron, sitting down with a glass of cool champagne in the breeze at the second 
level 410 feet over Paris. "Monsieur Viguier, the man I am portraying, did not 
make it beyond here."

NOTHING SUBTLE ON EIFFEL TOWER 100TH BIRTHDAY 




By RONE TEMPEST, Times Staff Writer 




PARIS 




Early in the show, two men ablaze but in special asbestos suits will ascend the 
Eiffel Tower while 53 others jump off it, tied by elastic cords. 


Later, rock singer Johnny Halliday, known as "the French Elvis," will roar onto 
a huge stage, built at the foot of the tower, in the company of 100 
leather-jacketed motorcyclists and their bikes. From the stage, from barges in 
the Seine, from holes in a giant birthday cake at the Palais de Chaillot, will 
emerge music, dancers, tightrope walkers, fashion models, fireworks and laser 
beams. 


Finally, Ronald Reagan and his friend, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris will 
unveil the 76-foot tall cake. One thousand chefs will pour out of the huge 
pastry, with candles and slices of cake for le peuple. 


Happy 100th birthday, Eiffel Tower! Happy 200th anniversary, French Revolution! 


The cost of Mayor Chirac's 89-minute party tonight for several hundred thousand 
guests: $10 million. 


No matter, it seems. This is no time for prix fixe. This is a time of 
Revolutionary excess and Bicentennial one-upsmanship in the French capital. 


Not to be outdone by arch-rival Chirac, his opponent in a bitter presidential 
election last year, President Francois Mitterrand, has invited President Bush, 
29 other world leaders and an estimated crowd of 2 million to his own party for 
the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14. 


The Mitterrand party, a parade that will include elephants, horses painted to 
look like zebras and the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band doing the moon-walk 
down the Avenue des Champs Elysees, is expected to cost $15 million. 


Aides to Chirac and Mitterrand deny any revelry rivalry. However, Mitterrand 
was not invited to Chirac's party tonight. Nor was Chirac invited to 
Mitterrand's fete next month. 


"There is absolutely no competition between the two," insisted Chirac aide 
Thierry Aumonier. "It is a simple matter of protocol. It is the mayor of Paris 
who invites. President Mitterrand was not invited." 


Although the president was snubbed, Aumonier said Chirac did invite Minister of 
Culture Jack Lang, a Mitterrand ally, "who will be given a position of honor 
right next to Reagan." 


Each show has an eccentric director with his own ideas of how to celebrate 
history. Promoters for Chirac's Eiffel Tower party, directed by Olivier 
Massart, describe it as an event that "combines Jules Verne and Fellini -- an 
enormous naive event that mixes the wildest imagination with the glory of 
industrial performances. Living artists mix with enormous pictures on 
unpalpable screens." 


Mitterrand's fete is more playful, reflecting the elfin personality of 
Jean-Paul Goude, a veteran American and French advertising man. 


"When I was a kid," said Goude, "I always dreamed of putting on a show at the 
Theater of the Champs Elysees," a musical and dramatic theater near the famous 
boulevard. "Now they have offered me the whole Champs Elysees. How could I 
refuse?" 


Goude's show will also benefit from Mitterrand's position as commander-in-chief 
of the French military. In addition to 8,000 extras, 1,500 drummers and a 
90-foot steam-belching train engine with 20 men pounding on oil drums, 3,000 
French soldiers will join the parade. 


Director Massart, who seems to be benefiting mainly from Chirac's friendship 
with Reagan, will have 3,500 extras, 300 fashion models, 100 accordionists and 
20 international stars, ranging from French crooner Charles Aznavour to Stevie 
Wonder. 


Each of the rival shows has problems. The Chirac spectacle will be rudely 
interrupted by a commercial for Citroen, the French car maker. And Massart's 
decision to install a "Noah's Ark" sequence in the middle of a historical 
theme, which begins with the French Revolution, has left American television 
director Walter C. Miller puzzled. 


"Some of this stuff I simply do not understand," said Miller, part of the 
American Radio City Music Hall team hired to hired to tape the show for 
international television. "We go from the French Revolution to Noah's Ark. It's 
just not chronological." 




Too Tall for TV 


Another worry for Miller, a veteran of big spectacles who staged the 
inauguration of President Bush among other events, has to do with the tower 
itself. The 1,000-foot-high tower, constructed by French engineer Gustave 
Eiffel for the World's Fair of 1889, has a bad, as Miller put it in television 
terms "aspect ratio." In short, it is too tall for television. There is no way 
to show a performer and the tower at the same time. As a result, the performers 
will appear on the small screen as though they are set before a jungle-gym, not 
the whole magnificent iron-lace tribute to the dawn of the modern age. 


Goude, meanwhile, is beset by political problems. The Chinese portion of his 
"parade of planetary tribes" -- a giant drum pulled down the street by cyclists 
with dancers from the Beijing Opera and flailing martial artists, was canceled 
because of the recent political turmoil in China. Soviet officials objected to 
Goude's idea of having Kremlin guards goose-stepping down the street to African 
music while a ballerina danced with a bear. 


Citizens from Brittany refused to march in a Goude scene that they claimed made 
them look like comic strip characters. Their main objection appeared to be his 
proposal that they should wear traditional Brittany bigoudenes -- starched 
white head-dresses worn by women in the region -- but lit up with neon tubes. 


Finally, Parisians of all stripes are fed up with both political leaders for 
the inconvenience that their respective parties will cause drivers. For 
Chirac's fete tonight, a 6.2-square-mile area in the heart of Paris has been 
closed to all vehicular traffic. 


Traffic restrictions will be even more severe for the Mitterrand Bicentennial 
events. Mitterrand has complicated his celebration by inviting the leaders of 
the world's other six richest industrial nations to hold their annual economic 
summit here. He also invited dozens of leaders from the world's poorest nations 
to meet with the rich nations' leaders. 


Almost every leader will require a motorcade. Security will be intense. The 
Paris police chief has said he will mobilize 30,000 police, compared to only 
1,500 for the Chirac event. As a result, from July 10 to July 17, a huge 
section in the center of Paris, from the Bois de Boulogne in the west to the 
Louvre Museum in the east, will be closed to most traffic. 


Fumed Le Figaro, a Paris-based newspaper that supported Chirac and not 
Mitterrand in the presidential election last May: 


"Ten million Parisians and inhabitants of the suburbs are preparing to live a 
weeklong nightmare."

GOINGS ON: SANTA BARBARA; 


VIVE LA PARADE; 


THE ANNUAL FRENCH FESTIVAL BOASTS FOOD, A MINIATURE EIFFEL TOWER AND A PARADE 
OF POODLES. 




By MAJA RADEVICH 




When Steve Hoegerman first shared his idea of starting a French Festival in 
Santa Barbara's Oak Park, his friends started making jokes: 


"Hey, for atmosphere, why don't you get the Eiffel Tower and stick it right in 
the middle of the park. Ha, ha, ha," Hoegerman said, remembering the teasing he 
received from his buddies. 


"Why don't you get a bunch of those French poodles together and make a parade. 
Ha, ha, ha. 


"So what's everyone gonna do at a French Festival? Stand around and be rude to 
each other?" 


Hoegerman dismissed the last joke. "The Parisians do have a reputation of being 
curt," he said. "But stereotyping the French would be like one of them visiting 
New York and then saying that all Americans yell at each other." 


He did take a keener interest in the other two jokes. And now the wooden Eiffel 
Tower and the poodle parade are two regular and whimsical features of the 
celebration. 


The tower, about as tall as a two-story building, looms over the park, 
overseeing the two-day festival this weekend like a demure French ambassador. 
The other 363 days of the year, the structure is separated into three parts 
that Hoegerman stows in his mother's carport. 


Along with the tower, other attractions at the third-annual Fete Francaise 
include French food and wine, folk singing and dancing, free French lessons and 
a display of classic and contemporary French cars. The poodle parade will run 
from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday. 


Last year, about 40 poodles attended, some in costume, some in styled 
coiffeurs, to do tricks or just promenade around the park. 


"My favorite was this huge, black great dane that someone covered in crumpled 
up pieces of paper to make it look like it had a poodle cut. They called it 
'Mademoiselle Pseudo Poodle," Hoegerman said in an accent achieved through 
years of study and travel. 


Visitors to the event will have a chance to enjoy fine food and wine as 15 
chefs from some of Santa Barbara's best French restaurants prove their talents. 
Customers can eat their meal at dozens of outdoor tables complete with umbrella 
and checkered tablecloths. 


From that vantage point, they can view the colony of impressionist-style 
painters working at their easels; the mimes and jugglers wandering through the 
crowds; the models showing off the French flair for fashion, and can-can girls 
recalling the years when that style of dance was considered more risque than 
the lambada is today. 


Hoegerman, who has a bloodline that classifies him as "marginally French, not 
enough to really count," started the event when no one else would. "The local 
French never started their own French festival," he said, "because they're so 
typically French." 


While some people are viewing the antics of the poodle parade, others can enjoy 
the cavorting of the Cahoots improvisational comedy troupe, at 7:30 p.m. 
Sunday. Members invite suggestions from the audience and improvise scenes on 
the spot. Tickets are $6 and available in advance or at the door at Alhecama 
Theatre, 914 Santa Barbara St. (805) 962-8606. 


For those wanting to frolic mid-week, mandolinist David Grisman and his new 
quintet will make their Santa Barbara debut tonight at the Victoria Street 
Theater, 33 W. Victoria St. Grisman, who composes and plays an acoustic sound 
known as "Dawg Music," has performed with such artists as James Taylor, Bonnie 
Raitt, and Dolly Parton. Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $15 and available at 
Folk Mote Music (805) 962-0830, and Arlington Ticket Agency, (805) 963-4408. 


* WHERE AND WHEN: The third-annual Santa Barbara French Festival will be 
celebrated Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Oak Park. Admission is 
free. For 24-hour information, call: (805) 568-5933. To register for the poodle 
parade, call (805) 569-1636.

ART REVIEWS; 


CALDER UNLOADS SOME ZINGERS AT RUTBERG GALLERY 




By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




An artist sometimes becomes such a household name, you forget why he's good. 


Alexander Calder, who will forever be known as the guy who invented the mobile, 
also brought a wide-eyed zing to painting and stationary sculpture. An 
exhibition of some of his pieces dating from the 1920s to the '70s (he died in 
1976) reminds us what a disingenuous tinkerer he was -- and how fully he 
absorbed the European Surrealist ethos and Americanized it into a brashly 
lyrical fanfare. A couple of pieces also reestablish Calder's credentials as a 
political commentator. 


An exquisitely finished untitled painting from 1945 shows the artist at full 
Surrealist throttle. What appears to be a sprightly imaginary landscape is 
filled with portents of nuclear disaster. 


White-hot light illuminates the underside of the cap of a tall mushroom plant 
that softly dissipates into the earth. A striped hourglass form hovers in the 
yellow sky, not far from a phalanx of horizontal, airborne shapes that look 
like escapees from a molecular diagram. A snake -- one of Calder's favorite 
images -- wiggles ominously through the brown earth. 


Similarly, a cheerful-looking 1969 gouache, "Pennants to the Bird," seems to be 
about the Vietnam War. The "bird" -- which rears up on its hind legs, alongside 
a row of waving red pennants in Calder's inimitable scribble-style -- is surely 
a belligerent American eagle. A dove, symbol of peace, is painted black. 


Other works are simply dogged investigations of forms in space. "Hollow Fish," 
from 1929, is a doodle in brass wire -- the sort of thing Calder had been doing 
all his life. (When I interviewed his sister years ago, she unwrapped a group 
of tiny wire animals he made when he was a small child.) A series of irregular 
spirals fills out the body of the fish and hints at its flickering movement; 
the tail is a flat design that incorporates the artist's signature. 


There are some mobiles and stables on view, too, though their appeal has become 
somewhat dimmed by the ubiquity of Calder's industrial-sized pieces. Even so, 
some of the small, handmade versions -- like "Duck," a zoomorphic stabile from 
the mid '40s -- still can be appreciated for their delicious economy of means 
and suppleness of wit. 


Jack Rutberg Gallery: 357 N. La Brea Ave., (213-938-5222), to Jan. 31. Closed 
Sundays and Mondays, and Dec. 23 through Jan. 1. 


Buzz Word: Aficionados of Los Angeles artist Buzz Spector expect his work to 
yield a delicate combination of humor, erudition, worldly commentary and subtle 
visual pleasures. A group of eight new works by Spector does not disappoint, 
though it contains a couple of one-liners ("Tear" and "Leer") along with more 
meditative pieces. 


Half of "French Letters" consists of postcard-sized photographs of the Eiffel 
Tower alternating with photographs of a debonair chap; on the other half, the 
Eiffel Tower alternates with a woman posing by candlelight. 


The title of the piece is a reference to the epistolary romance hinted at by 
the photos as well as the English term for condoms: The distance between the 
lovers effectively serves as a prophylactic. The Eiffel Tower, symbol of the 
country synonymous with romance, is an iron framework -- and so is a chastity 
belt. 


In the photographs, both of the lovers play with hoary romantic motifs -- 
candlelight, stagy poses -- to create intrigue. But then again, Spector creates 
his own intrigue by juxtaposing the images of two people who probably never met 
and fitting them into a checkerboard pattern suggestive of the games lovers 
play. The piece is a visual jeu d'esprit, offered in the demurely allusive 
terms of the lovers' vanished era. 


The activity of collecting is the subject of two pieces. "Re: Collections 
(shells)" consists of a collection of individual shells and a "collector shell" 
(which picks up other shells on its travels), all neatly filed in wooden 
pigeonholes. 


The accompanying text describes the collector shell's habits in human terms, as 
if it really feels "the final thrill, the thrill of acquisition." The death 
rattle lurking in those words and the tacit suggestion that seemingly 
sophisticated human habits are no more significant than those of a mollusk 
gives the piece a fine sharp edge. 


"Re: Collections (boxes)" is simply a set of old metal-framed glass boxes of 
various sizes, nested inside one another. A metaphor for thought (the way an 
idea leads to a subset of itself), the boxes also suggest the increasingly 
specialized categories devised by the owner of a burgeoning collection, as a 
means of maintaining power over it. These boxes are empty, though; the urge to 
collect is quite independent of the specific objects collectors lust after. 


Roy Boyd Gallery: 1547 10th St., (213-394-1210), to Jan. 5. Closed Sundays and 
Mondays. 


TV Portraits: Allan McCollum's set of "Perceptual Photos" are blown-up 
photographs of undecipherable shadowy forms. The subjects of these images, 
photographed from a TV screen, are works of art hanging on the walls behind the 
main action in sitcoms and films. McCollum crops out the action and setting 
from the photo, enlarges the work of art to typical painting size and reframes 
it in utilitarian black. 


The action of isolating these images calls attention to the dogsbody's role a 
work of art plays in a TV show or film -- as an anonymous symbol of prestige in 
an office or invisibly appropriate furniture for a middle-class home. The 
subject matter isn't important; any traditional landscape or portrait will do. 
Nobody cares who painted it. The point is simply to stock the set with a 
product that registers generically as "art." 


"With all of my works, I have always meant to withhold the creation of specific 
meaning," McCollum has written, "because I am so much more interested in the 
quality of meaningfulness in and of itself." 


McCollum's point is not to pick nits with the media per se, but to examine in a 
larger sense -- and without overt moralizing -- the role of art as commodity in 
contemporary society. The uniqueness of a work of art is contradicted by the 
interchangeability of all works of art in the popular mind. The specific theme 
of a particular work evaporates under the far more intense identification of 
art with money and power. 


Finding the works of art he photographs in the midst of TV dramas is perhaps 
also McCollum's way of drawing attention to the way art is the locus of all 
sorts of human desires -- to communicate an idea, to enjoy oneself, to make a 
good investment, to gain the respect of one's peers. Somehow, we all want to be 
in the picture. 


Richard Kuhlenschmidt Gallery: 1634 17th St., (213-450-2010), to Jan. 12. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays.

EXTERIORS: LOFTS IN SUBURBIA; 


A SANTA MONICA-BASED ARCHITECTURAL FIRM SAW A NEED -- AND FILLED IT 




By MICHAEL WEBB, Michael Webb writes on architecture and design. 




INNOVATIVE ARCHITECTURE ALWAYS provokes dissent. Leading Parisians hated the 
Eiffel Tower when it was new, and critics panned the first designs for 
Rockefeller Center. So it was no surprise that the neighbors were up in arms 
when two young Australian architects -- Hank Koning and Julie Eizenberg -- 
proposed a pair of stark towers for a picture-perfect street in the Hollywood 
Hills. 


Two years later, the buildings remain controversial, but a close look reveals 
how ingeniously the Santa Monica-based firm of Koning Eizenberg Architecture 
accommodated special needs on a steep, narrow site. Koning and Eizenberg had 
discovered that there was an unsatisfied demand for what they called "suburban 
lofts" -- flexible open spaces that working couples could use as home-studios 
if they didn't want to live in a commercial zone. Each tower is three 
20-square-foot rooms stacked above a double garage. The small base reduced the 
cost of excavation and allowed the towers to be set well apart and aligned with 
the converging boundaries of the pie-shaped lot, creating a dramatic 
composition. 


The kitchen, bathroom and storage areas of each tower extend to the hillside 
behind. These two-story structures with gently bowed roof lines project out at 
angles that are calculated to give all rooms natural light without having views 
of the neighbors. An architect and interior designer work out of one tower, a 
theater producer and a movie director share the other, and both have put their 
spaces to inventive use. 


The street facades are still raw, but within a few years they should be 
submerged in a riot of honeysuckle, passion vines and bougainvillea to the 
height of the steel mesh balconies. In fact, half the houses nearby are white 
stucco cubes, but flowering trees make them as acceptable as the red-tiled 
Spanish cottages. The architects have picked up on other local features. The 
sheer profile of their towers echoes that of a 1920s landmark, a free-standing 
elevator shaft called High Tower, which serves a cluster of hillside homes just 
a block away. The steps that climb steeply from the street to sheltered patios 
at the top of the site recall other pedestrian ways in the neighborhood, such 
as Alta Loma Terrace. Even the deer still come down to feed.

SAILING ON SEINE: PARIS PASSENGER SERVICE LAUNCHED 




By RONE TEMPEST, Times Staff Writer 




PARIS 




With a powerful rumble from its twin diesel engines, the 10 a.m. river bus 
Rhone pulled away from its moorings Monday on the maiden voyage of what city 
officials hope will become the first regular passenger service along the Seine 
since 1935. 


It was a beautiful clear spring day. Girl scouts sold traditional May 1 
bouquets of lilies-of-the-valley on the river banks. Boat pilot Jean-Luc Daled, 
28, delighted with his new occupation as river bus driver, expertly guided the 
60-foot boat between the bridge pillars and maintained a flowing commentary. 


"You have to keep your distance from the bateaux mouches," he said, pointing to 
one of the huge tourist boats with several hundred passengers 50 yards 
upstream. "You can't stop one of these things like a car. Still, the traffic is 
much better down here on the river than it is up on the streets. It's very 
relaxed, don't you think?" 


Most of the passengers on this initial voyage were journalists, who busied 
themselves during the 45-minute round-trip interviewing each other and speaking 
for French, Japanese, German and Italian television cameras about the joys and 
beauties of river travel as opposed to the hassles and vulgarities of subway 
and bus transport. 




Curious Tourists 


But as the 158-passenger craft made the circuit of five stops between the 
Eiffel Tower and Paris City Hall, it began to gather a few legitimate fares, 
mostly curious tourists who had seen the ticket booths and tented passenger 
shelters along the river. 


The passenger boat service will be operated as an experiment until Sept. 30 to 
test the market, said Jean-Pierre Cuny, director of Bateaux Parisian, the 
private company that won the contract from the city of Paris and the government 
ministry in charge of river traffic. 


Initially, two batobus -- a combination name formed by its French government 
sponsors from bateau (boat) and autobus -- will run daily routes between 10 
a.m. and 8 p.m. Tickets are expensive compared to subway and bus fares -- $5 
for a single trip compared to 50 cents for a subway ride. 


The river ride is also considerably slower. For example, the trip between Port 
de la Bourdonnais underneath the Eiffel Tower to Quai de Montebello across from 
Notre Dame Cathedral takes 25 minutes, compared to only three minutes on the 
underground train that follows the same route. 


"The ground transportation system is so good it is hard to beat," admitted 
Cuny. However, officials are hoping for a steady flow of tourists, who can also 
buy cheaper all-day or weekly passes, and Parisians who want relief from the 
pressures of the city. 


Besides, said government spokesman Bertrand Duteil in defense of the batobus, 
"We may not be as fast as the subway. But we are able to show that the average 
speed of a city bus is less than 10 kilometers per hour (6 m.p.h.) while the 
batobus can do 12 kilometers per hour (7 m.p.h.)." 


The river bus system has many critics, especially among those who run the 
bateaux mouches sightseeing boats. 


"This is an old file that keeps popping up," said Michel Bryere, commercial 
director for one of the larger tourist boat companies. "If the idea of the 
system is to make a profit from Parisians by taking them to work, then it is 
not possible." 


The last regular commercial transport system on the Seine, the vaporetto boats 
that plied the river between Suresnes and the Marne River, went bankrupt in 
1935. A recent similar attempt -- entitled River Bus -- to provide passenger 
traffic on the Thames in London has suffered financial difficulties. 


However, many Parisians remember fondly several weeks in 1972 when subway and 
train strikes almost brought the city to a standstill. Several of the bateaux 
mouches operators ran regular routes up and down the river. 


"During the strikes of 1972, I carried 7,000 people a day in my boats," 
recalled boat operator Jean Brunet. "I'm ready to go again if this proves 
successful."

SPECIAL DELIVERY; 


GROUP FLIES MUCH-NEEDED GIFTS FROM VAN NUYS TO MEXICAN TOWN 




By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




SANTA ROSALIA, Mexico 




A dozen single-engine planes from Van Nuys Airport braved thorny cacti and 
federales worried about drug smugglers to land during the Thanksgiving weekend 
at this town's tiny airstrip. 


"What's going on in Santa Rosalia -- a convention?" asked a baffled customs 
official at the border in Mexicali as one plane after another filed plans 
Friday to journey 350 miles south down the Baja peninsula. 


After all, this impoverished little mining town with its rocky beaches is 
hardly a mecca for tourists. Officials said the only group that uses the local 
airstrip is drug smugglers, who occasionally manage to refuel here despite 
attempts by federal police to stop them. 


But it is exactly this lack of cachet that makes the village an ideal recipient 
of the clothing, medical supplies and toys the pilots have delivered every 
Thanksgiving weekend for the past eight years. 


"We're lucky we have a harbor here with plenty of fish, otherwise, the poor 
would starve," said Jose Luis Nuno, as he helped the pilots and their families 
unload plastic bags full of cargo Friday evening at the airstrip. 


Nuno said the local Rotary Club will sell the hundreds of pounds of clothing to 
the poor for a nominal fee and use the proceeds to assemble baskets filled with 
enough groceries to feed 70 local families for two weeks. 


"Without doubt, your efforts will be good for the lower classes here," said Dr. 
Miguel A. Montano, Rotary Club president and a hospital administrator. 


The annual pilgrimage from Van Nuys Airport is something of an occasion in this 
town of 20,000. At the end of journey, a five-hour trip that requires skill to 
avoid overshooting the one paved runway and landing in the cacti, the 30 
Americans were welcomed with cold beer and pots of fresh ceviche, an appetizer 
of raw yellowtail caught earlier in the day and marinated with spices and lime. 


"It's a neat feeling to help out directly instead of just giving money to a 
charity," said Ron de Moraes, 43, a television director who lives in Simi 
Valley. "And the Mexican people are so generous to us." 


Although most of the pilots are volunteer members of a Van Nuys-based squadron 
of the Civil Air Patrol, Moraes and several others joined the entourage after 
seeing signs advertising "Operation Thanksgiving" on bulletin boards at Van 
Nuys Airport. The participants gather donations of clothing, toys and medical 
supplies during the year from friends and fellow workers. 


Ann Hagen, a retired medical technician from Malibu, spent much of her spare 
time this past year washing and repairing hundreds of used teddy bears and 
other stuffed animals in preparation for the trip. "I feel like Santa Claus," 
Hagen said Friday as she handed out toys to children at the airport. 


The relief effort was started in the early 1980s by the Huntington Park Rotary 
Club and adopted by the Van Nuys group a few years later, said Lou Milligan, 
66, a Van Nuys car dealer and the organizer of the trip. The pilots spend about 
$150 per plane for fuel, and most take advantage of the trip south to visit 
nearby resort towns on Sunday, Milligan said. 


The only snag the operation has hit was in 1985 when border guards confiscated 
the group's entire cargo, claiming they were more capable of equitably 
distributing it than the Americans, Milligan said. Since then, the group had 
not been explicit about its purpose when crossing the border, he said. 


On Friday night, the visitors attended a buffet dinner the Santa Rosalia Rotary 
Club gives every year in their honor. After sampling more than 20 local 
specialties, including fresh tuna salad and marinated giant squid, the guests 
were given small gifts, such as abalone shells and black coral necklaces carved 
from a nearby reef. 


The youngest person in the group this year was 11-year-old Heather Loring of 
Burbank, whose parents brought her to "teach that not everyone lives in the 
same way, but we are all people" said her mother, Carol Loring, a financial 
analyst. 


"Every day in Los Angeles, you come across people in need," Carol Loring said. 
"We try to give at home through our church, but we believe in taking every 
opportunity to help out." 


Heather Loring had a chance to observe daily life in Santa Rosalia during a 
brief tour Nuno conducted Saturday for the visitors. Much of the village, which 
is tucked between a group of arid hills, has dirt roads lined with wooden 
buildings built by the French when they discovered copper here in the 1880s. 
The town's pride and joy is a prefabricated galvanized-iron church designed by 
A. G. Eiffel, who also designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 


But even at the church, where children met for a catechism class Saturday, the 
town's poverty was evident in the figure of a old man with a cane who 
approached the Americans for money. Later, as the bus left the center of town, 
the visitors could see on the hillsides tin and plywood shacks that Nuno said 
lacked running water. 


The town's fortunes, which declined in the early 1980s when the copper ran out, 
have improved lately with the discovery of gypsum, which is exported throughout 
the world for drywall, Nuno said. But at least 10% of the town's residents are 
unemployed, Nuno said, and many of those who work earn only about $3.50 a day, 
enough just to survive in an area where a carton of eggs costs $1, he said. 


Heather Loring may be too young to understand the economics of Santa Rosalia, 
but the trip clearly piqued her interest in Mexican culture, her mother said. 
On the way back to the hotel, the girl was practicing the Spanish alphabet with 
one of the pilots.

   By WILLIAM PACKER


The loss from the fire at Windsor castle has nothing to do with Heritage,
that now hateful, vulgar, sentimental word. Nor is it about the cost of
repairs, nor the loss of objects and artefacts, however wonderful. The loss
I feel as one who spent his boyhood in the shadow of that great tower is
harder to explain: an enormous, possibly irreparable, damage to the spirit
of the place and what it represents to Englishmen.
Samuel Pepys called Windsor: 'The most romantic castle that is in the
world'. It is also the largest inhabited castle in the world, and has been
in continuous habitation, since the time of the William the Conqueror. It
is, by any measure, extraordinary and wonderful.
Even as the flames swept through the great hall on Friday night, television
announcers were meanly asking how much it would all cost; and the row about
who will pay continues in Parliament and elsewhere. Good God: could they not
see that some 900 years of our common history has gone up in smoke. Yes, I
admit, I take the disaster personally. For those of us who lived in the
town, that familiar towering silhouette was always present, as constant as
Fuji-san is to a Japanese or the Eiffel Tower to a Parisian. I saw it from
my bedroom window, on my way to school, from the Great Park, from the forest
at Dedworth, or away across the Brocas and along the river from Boveney
Lock. There it would be, through the trees, around every corner.
But it would change, too, with every shift of the clouds and mood of the
weather. I remember it in the long damp week between the death of the King
and his funeral, so quiet and still, shrouded in the mists of early
February. Most of all I remember the funeral itself, we children standing at
the top of the Long Walk inside the Park gates, the crunch of wheels and
feet on the gravel, the shadowy, veiled figures in the closed coach, the
bands, the shouted orders coming towards us through the mist, past us and
away, the minute guns, boom, boom, in the Park: and all the while the white
looming walls of the Castle just barely visible through the fog.
I would often go into the Castle, a marvellously safe place for a schoolboy
to be when he shouldn't be, with nothing better to do than slope off for a
smoke and to admire the view. I would go up the Round Tower, or pay my
sixpence to go into the Curfew Tower with its clock and dungeons, or
perhaps, late in the afternoon, slip into St George's to hear sung Evensong.
One special game, at the height of the tourist season, was to go out along
the North Terrace, just where the fire has destroyed St George's Hall, to
where one long queue was waiting to go into the State Apartments, and
another, even longer, was waiting to see The Queen's Dolls' House. I would
walk alone between the two lines and up to the barrier, which, after a low,
brief exchange, would be unhooked to let me pass. 'Yes sir? You wish to see
the drawings, sir? Of course. This way, sir.' Insufferable.
I felt, as many others did, intensely proprietorial about the place. I too
had - still have - a Windsor Castle of my very own - ancient, familiar,
comfortable, romantic, fixing the present so very firmly in the continuous
historic past. And it is a feeling about the place itself, and the town
which grew up around it, and the countryside of river and park beyond, and
the people who made it what it is.

I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last
week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study
the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of St Lazare at Autun. At the
same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th-century carvings of
the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of Moissac;
and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship
between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of St Madeleine at
Vezelay. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from Chartres
as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all
over France.
I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to
mark the re-opening of the Musee National des Monuments Francais at the
Palais de Chaillot. The story of this museum goes back to the 1880s when the
architect Eugene-Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) had the idea that the
French public should have the chance to see, in Paris, the high points of
French architecture and sculpture of the Middle Ages. He put together this
remarkable assembly of cast copies of important elements of buildings in
what was then the new Palais du Trocadero, which had originally been
designed by the architect Davioud for the Paris Universal Exhibition in
1878.
The display was always intended to be didactic, offering the visitor the
opportunity to make comparative analyses of stylistic developments.
Viollet-le-Duc was a scholar and historian and his architectural activity
consisted principally of repair and restoration, including work on monuments
including Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. He wrote a dictionary
of French architecture and this museum is an effective monument to his
conviction that architects can and should learn from the past. He saw the
parallels between Gothic structures and the development of 19th-century
engineering.
As the original progenitor of the museum, Viollet-le-Duc would have approved
of the way it has suddenly taken on a new lease of life. The original
Trocadero was transformed in 1937 by the architect Carlu into the Palais de
Chaillot, as the centrepiece of the Paris Universal Exposition of that year.
Today these former exhibition buildings gather around the steps and stylish
fountains of the Trocadero, paying homage to the Eiffel Tower. They remain
resolutely of the 1930s and provide an extraordinary contrast to the
architectural collections housed there.
For a long time the casts have been seen as little more than dusty relics,
stranded in the 1930s splendour of the Chaillot. It has taken the dramatic
energy of Mr Jack Lang and his ministry of education and culture to see the
potential of this important museum. It has also taken an enormous amount of
work and inspiration from the young curator  - Mr Guy Cogeval, who came here
from the Louvre; in only six months he has achieved a considerable
transformation.
It begins in the new entrance hall which has been designed by a young
architect, Jean-Christophe Denise. This is a handsome light space in the
spirit of Carlu. It has a most stylish cafe-restaurant with a marvellous
view of the fountains of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower (the furniture
is based on Carlu's original art deco designs); there is also a new
bookshop. The clean lines of this hall provide a cool setting for the four
giant fragments of the reproduction of the sculpture - 'la danse de
Carpeaux' - originally created by Paul Landowski in 1931. These look
dramatic and surreal, mounted at a high level on large plinths.
The hall is accessible to all visitors to the museums in the Palais de
Chaillot, including those of the theatre and cinema. (The Musee du Cinema is
likely to enjoy a close relationship with the renovated Musee national des
Monuments Francais because of Mr Cogeval's great interest in film and his
plans to create events that explore both the plastic and the cinematic
arts.)
To visit the great halls upstairs that house the maquettes, casts and models
is a thrilling experience, although in time the displays will probably be
reordered and captioned to make them both more instructive and more
enjoyable. Mr Cogeval is anxious to make more of the amazing collections of
topographical and architectural photographs stored here. They will form part
of the large programme of temporary exhibitions.
The first exhibition to be held is called 'Marseille a Paris', a version of
the very successful exhibition held in Marseilles. Its subject is the city
in the 19th century, considering both the physical character of the changing
city and the artistic activity within it at the time. A large variety of
artefacts ranging from contemporary models and maps to paintings and plans,
drawings and sculptures is displayed to convey the commerce and creativity
of one entire city at a peak moment of its growth. (The installation here is
sometimes inevitably in conflict with the permanent installation of the
museum, but in 1994 there will be a full-scale temporary exhibition space.)
Marseilles grew and prospered in the 19th century, its artistic flowering as
aesthetically mixed as any other city at the time. It is probably right to
show the whole range so that comparisons of quality can be made. Relatively
unknown history painters are shown as seriously as old masters, and posters
and plans rub shoulders with fine drawings. It is a complex and dense
exhibition, giving a sense of a city touched by the exoticism of its African
trade and yet solidly rooted in the Second Empire in its architecture and
monuments.
The renewal of this museum in Paris is important for the broadening of our
architectural culture. It will take a lot of imagination to build on the
solid foundations of the unique collection. The resurrection has just begun,
but I am sure Mr Cogeval will ensure that it continues with both scholarship
and excitement. It is a museum to watch.

REAGAN HONORED 2ND TIME ON TOUR 




From Times wire services 




PARIS 




Former President Ronald Reagan was inducted today into the prestigious French 
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, his second honor during a weeklong 
European tour. 


Reagan became an associate member of the honorary academy of political, 
religious and civic leaders one day after receiving an honorary knighthood from 
Queen Elizabeth II in London. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived from London 
today for a three-day visit to Paris, where they also planned to help celebrate 
the 100th birthday of the Eiffel Tower. 


Reagan became the sixth U.S. President to join the academy's ranks, taking over 
a vacancy created by the death of Swiss theologian Hans Urs Von Balthasar.

Paris, Tokyo Most Expensive: The typical business traveler staying in a 
first-class hotel and eating in business-class restaurants for a month would 
find that Paris and Tokyo cost the most money, a private survey said. A 
monthlong stay in Paris would cost $7,260, with Tokyo close behind at $7,185, 
according to the meal and lodging survey by travel consultant Runzheimer 
International. Living costs in other major cities are considerably less for the 
businessman or woman on the move -- a month's stay in Hong Kong runs up a bill 
of $5,670, London $5,925, and Geneva, $5,115. Runzheimer said costs can be 
roughly halved by putting employees up in furnished rental apartments complete 
with a maid and a cook to serve half their meals at their home away from home.

WILL WEST AND THE WORLD BUILD ON DECENCY, OR ON EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS? 




By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson was a Democratic candidate for 
President in 1988. 




As the Western European nations prepare for integration in 1992, two 
dramatically different conceptions of the new economic and social order in 
Europe are taking shape, with important consequences for the world. 


All sides perceive that with the Cold War limping to an end and Soviet and 
Eastern European markets opening up, the prospects for continental economic 
expansion will be substantial. The question is: What kind of pan-European 
society will emerge from the coming boom? 


British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's vision is of unrestricted freedom 
for business to invest capital all over the continent. She envisions business 
inducements, high-rise profits and skyscraper corporations. But she makes no 
provisions for the progress of Europe's working people. She imagines a new 
Europe built like the Eiffel Tower but with a very shaky foundation. 


This Europe would look like the Britain of the 1980s, where 10 years of 
conservative government have increased social disparities and allowed the 
business class to consolidate extraordinary power over working people. One 
disturbing trend in Britain is so-called flexibilization, which uses part-time, 
free-lance, on-call and temporary workers as well as unorganized home workers. 
By 1985, according to a study by the British government, one-third of all 
workers and half of all working women fell into this easily exploited 
non-unionized secondary labor market. 


The opposing vision of the new Europe, associated with French President 
Francois Mitterrand, also includes free markets but insists on a base line of 
democratic rights for citizens to a livable wage, workplace democracy, adequate 
health care, excellent schools and decent housing. Having grown up with the 
sight of the Eiffel Tower, President Mitterrand knows that the base must 
correspond proportionally to the height if the structure is to endure. Any plan 
for high-rise profits without a foundational commitment to the working people 
on whose shoulders the system rests will be doomed to collapse in the first bad 
wind. 


President Mitterrand thus wants to promote a European community that is not 
just a free-trade zone but an international society whose citizens are 
committed to a decent life. Competition, yes, but community also. Without a 
social contract that includes all Europeans, Mitterrand believes that European 
governments will be driven to try to "outbid" one another for new capital 
investment by destroying the hard-won gains of working people. Fierce 
competition for capital, without corresponding protections for labor, will 
plunge working Europeans into a vicious downward spiral of wage and benefit 
losses, immigration crises, racial tensions and personal unhappiness. 


This downward spiral for working people feared by President Mitterrand has 
already begun in the United States, where unionized workers struggle to protect 
their modest gains not only against pressures from right-to-work states, but 
pressures from oppressive sweatshop nations like Indonesia and Singapore. 
Meanwhile, 10 years of Republican rule have delivered the pathologies 
accompanying social polarization: Appalling levels of homelessness and 
illiteracy, a health crisis for 37 million uninsured Americans, devastation of 
the nation's inner cities and a loss of moral values manifested in insider 
trading, government corruption and drug abuse. 


Eyeing other opportunities for a fast buck, many private American corporations 
now simply want to call off the bargain between business and labor. For 
example, in 1987 the Pittston Co., which operates mines in the coal fields of 
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, refused for the first time to be bound by 
industrywide collective bargaining. 


It tried instead to shove down the workers' throats a Thatcher-type contract, 
allowing it to sub-contract jobs, eliminate long-established job rights, compel 
miners to work on holidays and Sundays, weaken health and safety provisions, 
reduce take-home pay for some workers, extend working hours and reduce 
health-care benefits, which are crucial to the people who risk their lives 
underground every day pulling coal from the Earth. 


Then Pittston refused to enter into arbitration, later even turning down an 
offer by the governor of West Virginia to mediate. Their families' health and 
livelihood threatened by the rapaciousness of the corporate profiteers, their 
backs against the wall, the miners went out on strike. More than 2,000 of them 
have been arrested for civil disobedience. Despite the Thatcherite assault on 
their rights by the corporate lawyers who Ronald Reagan turned into judges, 
they have hung in there, true working-class heroes. 


But the odds against them are stacked with the Republican-dominated courts and 
most politicians far more interested in the freedom of capital than the freedom 
of human beings. 


That is why I think President Mitterrand has an important point in his debate 
with Mrs. Thatcher. If we don't develop a new social contract that guarantees 
the rights of labor, then the corporations -- in pursuit of profit wherever 
labor power is weak -- are going to roll over working people. Democracies must 
stop the one-sided class warfare and the economic violence that is being waged 
by corporations against working people. 


I would only take President Mitterrand's plan for a new social contract one 
step further. To be effective and to be just, we cannot pretend that what 
happens in Europe and America affects only Europeans and Americans. For the 
21st Century, we need a declaration of basic human rights for workers all over 
the world.

BASTILLE DAY; 


LET THEM EAT CAKE -- ALL 50 FEET OF IT 




By LAURIE OCHOA, Times Staff Writer 




There are certain phrases one doesn't expect to hear from the mouths of pastry 
chefs at work: "Hand me that masking tape to stabilize the cake," for example. 
When building a 50-foot high layer cake in honor of the French Revolution 
bicentennial, however, masking tape can be essential. 


Other required ingredients: 3,600 eggs, 200 egg whites, 1,430 pounds of genoise 
(sponge cake) mix, 638 pounds of raspberry filling, 72 bottles of Cointreau 
liqueur, one ton of sugar, 355 pounds of frosting. You also need a good supply 
of wood, Styrofoam, stainless steel tubing, electrical wire and the services of 
a professional welder. 


Wednesday morning, on the Hollywood Park race-track infield, preparation for 
the 50-foot high cake, the focal point of this Sunday's French Food and Wine 
Festival, were well under way. Scattered early bird handicappers in the 
grandstands occasionally glanced up from their Racing Forms to observe the 
activity, but mostly they ignored the gathering of the 15 or so white-clad 
pastry chefs who climbed about the wood arches of the not-yet-completed cake 
frame, applying bits of frosting and mugging for newspaper photographers. 


Looking at a nearby bench getting drenched by a sprinkler, the cake's designer, 
Citrus chef Michel Richard, shook his head and said, "Oh, I hope they don't 
turn the sprinklers on my cake." 


Hanging 25 feet in the air in the tub of a hydraulic lift was Don Slater, the 
Hollywood Park chef who did much of the grunt work in construction of the cake 
base. Trained at New York's Culinary Institute of America, he makes 
monster-size ice carvings, cheese-and-wine displays and cakes. But, he said, 
"This cake is the biggest thing I've done, though." 


"It's 50 feet and 35 inches," said Michel Grobon, Hollywood Park's executive 
chef. "We measured all the pieces yesterday." Grobon organized the cake-baking 
and prepared the way for the 35 restaurants and wineries expected to set up 
food booths for Sunday's festival. 


When finished, after an all-night decorating session Saturday, the cake will 
look like two down-sized models of Paris' Arc de Triomphe stacked atop one 
antoher -- plus a steel-tube version of the Eiffel Tower lit by white Christmas 
tree lights atop the arcs. Sixty-watt light bulbs will power eight giant 
candles, and 1,500 pounds of dry ice will prevent frosting meltdown. 


"I think it's the largest cake you can build without a foundation system," said 
David Davis, the architect who helped plot the cake's structure. Originally, 
the cake was to be 100 feet tall, but that would have required steel 
reinforcement, an elaborate foundation . . . and a building permit. 


All of which brings to mind the question: Why build such a tall cake? 


Citrus chef Richard, not satisfied with running one of the most respected 
restaurants in town, decided he wanted to create an attention-getting event 
that would spark a sense of community among restaurateurs in Los Angeles: "It's 
so tough here," he says, "so many cliques and groups. In France, everyone in 
the business sticks together." 


"It was really important for the cake to have a lot of the fun and flair of 
L.A.," said Davis, "while at he same time giving it a traditional nature. You 
know, Michel is a real classicist." 


As the photo shoot ended, Richard teased some of the women chefs and joked with 
some of the men, but those who know him well realized that his mood was 
subdued. The Monday night murder of his closest friend, Andre Coffyn (who was 
heavily involved in the plans of the cake), put an absurd twist on the project 
that kept his mind on the frivolous instead of the very serious. Shortly after 
the photographers left, tears came to his eyes. "Oh Andre," he said, "you 
should be here now."

touches on frame for 50-foot-high cake. MIKE MEADOWS / Los Angeles Times

POPULARITY OF BIG A LANDMARK HASN'T BEEN DIMMED BY AGE; 


ANAHEIM STADIUM: ANGEL AND RAM FANS FIND STRUCTURE THE PLACE TO MEET AND EAT 
BEFORE A GAME. 




By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




ANAHEIM 




Ever since the Big A was moved out by the 57 Freeway, the darn thing just 
hasn't worked right. 


Neither have the Angels -- but one has to suppose that is part of their charm. 


The club played its first season in the enclosed Anaheim Stadium in 1980 after 
the Big A scoreboard had spent nearly 15 seasons behind the left-center field 
fence. The stadium was enclosed to accommodate the Los Angeles Rams, who moved 
to Anaheim in 1980. 


The 70-foot wide halo on the Big A used to light up for home runs and would 
shine after Angel victories (though in those days, there was not much chance of 
blowing a fuse). 


Many were upset when plans were announced to enclose the stadium for the 1980 
season and move the Big A. But it now may be more popular than ever. 


Today, fans like the Big A just where it is. Though many still say they liked 
the stadium better when it was open, few complain about the Big A, which has 
become the place to meet. 


If you want to congregate before a Rams game, Angels game or anything at 
Anaheim Stadium, look for the Big A. 


"It's a good symbol for a meeting place," Sean Stiemlee of Huntington Beach 
said during the Angels' recent home stand. "I've been to 12 stadiums and it's 
one of the best things about this stadium. 


"The big, iron A . . . It works as a meeting point. You can see it from 
anywhere. No one can miss it." 


The Big A, which is 234-feet tall and weighs 240 tons, has had problems since 
July 17, 1979, when it was moved. 


At that time, approximately 1,000 people watched as contractors used a 125-ton 
crane, two huge dollies and lots of cable to move the Big A. 


But as a moving experience, it was all too brief. 


The Big A made it about 10 feet when a dolly under its base started to tilt. 
That put the engineers and stadium officials on edge -- as well as the Big A. 
Adjustments were made and the Leaning Tower of Anaheim finally made its 
1,290-foot trip across the parking lot. 


The plan was to use the scoreboard to announce upcoming dates and advertise 
stadium events. At first, it worked fine. But by 1984, the scoreboard was shut 
down because of performance problems. 


But you can't read the scoreboard while you're standing under it. 


Anaheim's little Eiffel Tower provides shelter when it rains, and shade in the 
summer -- the Big A regulars move east with the shadows for their picnics -- 
and it's a great reference point for finding lost cars. Plus, it has the 
advantage of being near the Katella Avenue entrance/exit, which offers the 
easiest freeway access, on the east side of the stadium. 


It's a perfect meeting place for a big group. During the recent home stand, 
Unisys and TRW were among those having employee picnics under the Big A. 


Steve Gillepie of Mission Viejo even likes the concrete base of the structure. 


"It's a great place to barbecue because of the raised cement," Gillepie said. 


And although it's illegal to drink alcohol in the parking lot, many of the 
people under the Big A take the risk. 


"They're usually pretty lax about it for Angel games," Gillepie said. "For Rams 
games they're a little more up-tight and they might take it away, but they 
usually leave you alone if you pick up your trash." 


While the party goes on under the Big A, the argument goes on inside the 
stadium whether the enclosed structure is better for baseball games. 


"I like it better the old way," John Avella of El Toro said. "It gave the 
stadium more . . . personality." 


Others disagree. 


"I like it better this way," Mike Nabrotzky said. "I like a fuller stadium. 
There's less wind and I think the (crowd) noise reverberates." 


Others don't care, just as long as the Big A stands. 


"I helped construct this thing in high school," said a man who would only 
identify himself as Steve because neither his wife nor his boss knew that he 
took a day off to go to an Angel game. 


"We worked on it during summer vacation. It was fun growing up in Anaheim then. 
We saw Disneyland go up and then this."
