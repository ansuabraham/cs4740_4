Cathryn Pope looks by far the youngest Tatyana I have seen. A mere
adolescent, she is shy and uncertain of herself, a bundle of unformed
impulses, blown this way and that by the conflicting emotions of the Letter
Scene. One's sympathy goes out to her, just as Tchaikovsky intended.
Inevitably the older Princess Gremin suits her less well (the top of the
voice is unpleasantly strained) but, in her, the opera has found its heart.
The Onegin and Lensky are well differentiated physically: Peter
Coleman-Wright's Onegin is tall and handsome, an outwardly assertive man
with firm and decisive singing to match; Bonaventura Bottone's Lensky is
short and plump, dressed in slightly shabby poet's clothes, his bright tenor
encompassing the music with accomplishment, but not much romance. Neither
stimulates the emotions, as Pope's Tatyana does.
The focus remains firmly on the central trio, though Ethna Robinson has the
cheerful bounce for Olga and Richard Van Allan gets dignity to do duty for
strong top notes as Prince Gremin. There is no need to look at the programme
to tell that a Russian conductor is in the pit. Alexander Polianichko hails
from the Bolshoy and gives us Tchaikovsky school of Svetlanov, vibrant,
passionate, the volume turned up to maximum for the Polonaise.
He has no doubts where the opera is heading and it is his brazen
decisiveness which keeps the momentum going in an evening which might have
faltered under another conductor. Presumably this budget production is only
intended as a stop-gap. What will ENO do for Eugene Onegin next time?

stand out in relief. (Like Richard Fairman after the first night, I find
myself on the qualified-admiration side.) The first act is played as if
observed from a detached distance: Vick likes his actors to behave as if in
a sober historical film, and nobody is to play directly to the audience for
sympathy.
As Elena Prokina's Tatyana writes her letter in a bare room, she remains
withheld, privately at grips with herself. Her small, natural gestures are
extremely touching, like her broken phrases; at the climax, however, the
voice is a touch strident, and therefore less expressive - not quite the
outpouring of feeling we wanted, just an operatic outburst.
Only Martin Thompson's appealing, desperate Lensky (and John Fryatt's
ineffable Monsieur Triquet) is allowed off the rein to make his full
impression. And that is brusquely extinguished with the duel scene, which we
watch through open barn-doors: he and Onegin march out of sight in opposite
directions before the fatal shot, and Lensky is of course never seen again.
Suddenly he is no more than a old grief of Onegin's, near-forgotten.
In productions more generous with feeling, the big formal dances at the
start of Act 3 often jar. With Vick's cooller vision, they are hardly more
formal than the rest, and he can use them satirically without contradicting
the overall tone; in fact he makes a tour de force of them, the better to
set off good, decent Prince Gremin's avowal (Frode Olsen is admirable here).
As always, Vick insists upon a moral point, and the final scene - Tatyana's
rebuff to Onegin - is played to reinforce that, not to let us wallow in
sympathy for Onegin or Tatyana.
One thing about Angus's conducting: in markedly rhythmic passages, he tried
to allow his singers time to round off phrase-ends gracefully - but they
pressed on unremittingly, leaving him to catch up. Evidently they were too
well-drilled in a tougher reading to bend. I should have liked more bending;
but it might not have suited Vick's stern style.

IN ONEGIN, in events shaped by an exact blending of accident, whim and fatal
misjudgment, the youthful hopes and dreams of all its leading characters are
shown to be crushed. The pessimism of Tchaikovsky's conclusion is pitiless,
the more so for having been reached by a dramatic process of
illusion-stripping leavened by the aura of country ease and familial
affection in which the early scenes are bathed.
This is one of the most deeply affecting of all operas. Or, rather, it can
be - when a just mixture of economy, tact, emotional depth and precise
characterisation is seen and heard to guide the direction of its staging and
score. In the new Welsh National Opera production it proves, alas, largely
un-affecting. The reason is not hard to find: a production hardly more than
a concatenation of arty effects, drenched in icing-sugar prettiness and, in
the finale, in over-the-top melodrama.
Howard Davies, a noted 'straight'-theatre director, was in charge of the
WNO's similarly arty Idomeneo last season; the difference, however, is that
he seems to have made a much bigger, indeed a monumental hash of Onegin. In
the Royal National Theatre's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof not long ago, he showed
himself a masterly judge of time, place, atmosphere and style. One of those
minor mysteries that dog the performing arts is how those same properties
could so comprehensively have been misjudged here.
Davies obviously wanted to make this the Chekhov opera that Tchaikovsky
failed to write (the collaboration between composer and playwright being, of
course, one of operatic history's most tantalising might-have-beens). To
achieve it he moves forward the period of Onegin to that of The Three
Sisters. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that; but from the railway line
surreally angled through the permanent set (by Bob Crowley) for the first
two acts, one senses that this has fuelled an ill-argued attempt at Social
Comment - crudely fulfilled in the third act, with its fin de siecle ball
full of social-malaise doings risible in themselves and constantly
contradicted by the music.
Worse than this is the Hollywood-and-water romanticism imposed on the early
scenes - all fluttering curtains artfully opened and closed (a lot of that,
and deeply significant every time) and peasant girls twirling balletically
across the stage and people sinking to the floor amidst trails of leaves and
snow. The main characters - Onegin and Tatyana above all - are allotted
stage actions which end up by robbing them of plausible motivation.
Often, brand-new motivation of mind-boggling stupidity is supplied. Drink,
if you please, drives Onegin to behave badly at the Larin party; Gremin's
aria is addressed, mirabile dictu, to Tatyana as well as Onegin. To play the
title part as an unshaven lout with a violent temper simply diminishes the
emotional drama. Again and again one feels the dramatic momentum ebbing
away, the heartfelt involvement of principals and chorus undermined, as
fancy stage pictures are created. Ah well - it does look pretty.
Carlo Rizzi is not, at this stage, a conductor able to restore balance
through the musical delivery. This is his first Onegin, and it shows - while
shapely, warm-toned orchestral playing betrays the presence in the pit of a
lively musician, his whippings-up of crypto-Puccinian excitement in moments
of passion denied Thursday's performance that very quality of tender
expansiveness through which Tchaikovsky's musical secrets are most
completely revealed. A fair amount of the David Lloyd-Jones translation got
covered.
The pity is that the cast, made up mostly of newcomers to the opera, could
have been encouraged to deliver a great deal more: above all the greatly
gifted Jason Howard (vocally a strong but unexpectedly dull Onegin), but
hardly less so Peter Rose (a loud, coarse Gremin). The Larin family - mother
(Penelope Walker) and daughters (Janice Watson and Yvonne Burnett) - display
a pleasing similarity in vocal vibrato, and form altogether an unusually
credible family unit.
Miss Watson's Tatyana, her lyric soprano cool but with lovely promise of
lustre and even lushness to come, is already the nearest thing WNO possesses
to a 'real' Onegin performer. One international element has been added: the
American Neil Rosenshein as Lensky, a role he undertook at Covent Garden
seven years ago. Since then, much heavier roles have been taken into his
repertory - at a price. Though Mr Rosenshein remains a touchingly
communicative actor, the dryness and wobble of his louder singing were
painful to hear.

On Tuesday at the Barbican, the ex-Soviet Alexander Lazarev took the BBC
Symphony through an excellent programme of just such oddly-matched
bedfellows. First we heard Wingless, a recent work by Giya Kancheli, a
59-year-old Georgian who like the Estonian Part remembers ancient chant, but
subsumes it into an unhurried meditative flow, barely varied, more like
recent Gorecki or John Tavener. In Wingless, chorale-fragments alternate
steadily with fluttery motifs like shepherd's pipes or birdcalls. It went on
for some 25 minutes; the mind wandered, drowsily and pleasantly.
Then Dmitri Alexeev came on to deliver Nikolai Medtner's Piano Concerto no.
1 (1918) with all the tingling energy needed to keep its 19th-century
virtuoso writing airborne, the intimate feeling for its introspective
passages, and the brains to set its tough, conservative structure in clean
relief. A welcome rediscovery; but all that was anti-Soviet about Medtner -
a refined neo-Brahmsian - was his reverence for Western musical models, and
his early departure from Russia to Paris and thence to Golders Green.
Russian pianists have been cultivating his music for many years now.
The 19-year-old Shostakovich's astonishing First Symphony (1925), which
Lazarev expounded in swift, clean lines that left ample room for the
first-desk BBC players to bring their solos to poignant life, was actually a
'Soviet' triumph long before the clampdown by Stalin and Khrennikov. Though
we hear tragic tensions in it, they cannot have had much to do with the
composer's later, well-founded political anxieties.
As for Prokofiev's Eugene Onegin scene-music (1936, for a dramatisation of
Pushkin's verse-novel which was officially thwarted), Edward Downes's
devoted restoration and revival on Monday with the Docklands Sinfonietta and
a team of actors revealed it as moderately interesting, but broken-backed.
The composer would soon recycle the best parts to more developed effect, in
Cinderella, War and Peace and his Seventh Symphony. Here we had costumed
players reading bits of Onegin, Lensky and Tatyana over the orchestra, very
well - but no Olga, nor any dancers at the two grand balls for which
Prokofiev designed several of his 44 numbers.
Though this 'semi-staged' version was less than a dramatisation, it occupied
a long 2 hours and 40 minutes. The director Timothy West also took pawky
relish in the lengthy narration, in Sir Charles Johnston's rhymed couplets.
Rather soon the strenuous hunt for rhymes grew irritating, like the
suppression of articles for scansion's sake - 'avert his chest from pistol's
click': shades of 'Pyramus and Thisbe'] I think Prokofiev's robustly plain
Onegin score wants full-dress staging with a brighter text, or else to be
left alone.

IT WAS Tchaikovsky's express wish that the first performance of Eugene
Onegin should be given by students. He feared that practised opera singers
would find it difficult to capture the ingenuousness of the young people in
Pushkin's tale, whose inability to control their emotions destroys the lives
of those they love and - ultimately - themselves.
After 20 years of a traditional staging the Royal Opera decided this summer
to try something new. John Cox's new production went as far as the borders
of the non-representational, which proved very sparing on visual beauty and,
presumably, cost. With a fine cast of big-voiced Russians and a noted
Tchaikovsky expert in the pit it won enthusiasm. But in revival, less
carefully rehearsed, less opulently played and sung?
The irony is that visiting singers need to work doubly hard on these
characters if they are to look natural, believable young people. When Onegin
is delivering his insufferably superior rebuff to poor Tatyana, it is
unhelpful to ask her to sink to her knees and finally crumple in a heap on
the ground - the standard reaction of a rejected prima donna. What is Onegin
to do: offer to help her up or leave her there?
Dmitry Hvorostovsky left her, but without sufficient disdain as to make her
grand opera gesture seem appropriate. As Onegin, he cuts a handsome figure,
at once proud and callow (the head is held at just the right angle to
suggest assumed superiority.) All told, Onegin must be Hvorostovsky's best
role. But he is short on specific insight and the voice runs out of power at
the top, however beautiful it can be on sustained notes lower down.
The Tatyana from whom he walks away is Catherine Malfitano. Not so long ago
she was a Royal Opera Tosca, but the voice is better suited to Tchaikovsky's
youthful heroine, easily able to take the climaxes in its stride. During the
Letter Scene, the shadings of vocal colour, the conscious mirroring of the
music in her movements, all spoke of an intelligent artist who had thought
long and hard in her preparation. Too hard, perhaps: the very awareness of
what she was doing robbed her Tatyana of naive sincerity.
Giuseppe Sabbatini's Lensky is easier to deal with - straightforward, not
much inner life suggested. His tenor is reedy, sometimes constricted, but he
is able to scale it down nicely to express affection and intimacy; the end
of his aria, at least, was the work of a poet.
Eirian James, a sparkling presence in primrose yellow, was a delightful
Olga. Gwynne Howell was a picture of wise old dignity as Prince Gremin,
leaving this Onegin with his wings visibly clipped.
A sharper cut, however, to the orchestral ensemble would be desirable. The
scrambled string playing that led into the second scene was only one example
of the general laziness that robbed Mark Ermler's conducting of its stock
Russian strength.
Faced with such a succession of unimaginative and ugly designs, perhaps even
a stock Russian production would be preferable. These sets are due to go to
Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Lucky them] - but may the boat please sink on the
way back.
Further performances at the Royal Opera House until November 11; there will
be a Radio 3 live broadcast on November 6

Nature, or rather town planning, has done Belfast's Grand Opera House no
favours. Next to the headquarters of the Ulster Unionists and across the
street from the Europa Hotel, the charming theatre has been the innocent
bystander in more than one bomb incident aimed at its neighbours.
Last Friday opera returned to the theatre after postponement through bomb
damage. Two Johns visited Belfast that day: Major, full of good intentions,
and Mozart's lascivious Sevillian who took the less well-paved but more
entertaining road to hell. Don Giovanni was played out in the unusually
intimate splendour of a fin-de-siecle interior, at first glance a
conventional Frank Matcham froth of gilt, cream and red, but with intriguing
eastern decorative motifs: Moslem sages jostle trumpet-playing cherubs on
the ceiling, cartouches frame Hindu gods, and elephant-heads form the
capitals of pillars.
This production is the result of co-operation between Opera Northern Ireland
and Bath and Wessex Opera. There were reportedly some technical hitches at
the first night in the west of England, and in Belfast the odd off-stage
crash and on-stage flash bespoke the occasional gremlin. But Roman
Terleckyj's production is as lithe and swift as its young cast. David
Myerscough-Jones' set is dominated by a huge grille that parts, ringing
changes on the basic theme of a closed-in society, with visual allusions
ranging from Piranesi-like nightmare prisons to the Marat-Sade spectacle of
panicky peasants clambering up the bars in an effort to escape the avengers
in the ball scene.
To judge by both Giovanni and the following night's Eugene Onegin, there is
no shortage of good baritones today. The Danish Johannes Mannov was a
plausible philanderer and a stylish Mozartian: his honeyed opening of 'La ci
darem la mano' with the sweet-voiced Zerlina of Yvonne Barclay turned it
into a real seduction. Eric Ashcraft's Ottavio was much less wimpish than
usual, Christopher Purves' light-voiced baritonal Leporello had the stage
communicativeness expected from an ex-Wallbanger (as in Harvey and the
ditto), John Hall's Commendatore was young and vigorous.
Musically Roy Goodman directed a fleet performance from the Ulster
Orchestra. Most stylish of all was the Elvira of Elizabeth Gale, once a
memorable Zerlina. There have been fuller voices in the role, but she knows
what the character and Mozart are about.
If Don Giovanni was conventionally enjoyable, Onegin had much in it that
reminded the English visitor of Pountneyesque ideas from ENO's glory days. A
little girl, Alice-like, wanders through the action: the child Tatyana was?
The innocence that never quite died? Invisible, all-seeing, she firmly shuts
a book over the grieving Onegin, as if the characters' destiny had been
already decided in the past. Between scenes a wind whistles across the
stage, dominated by the autumnal crimson of virginia creeper. There may be a
tendency to think of Pushkin's 'lyric scenes' as anticipating Chekhov.
However, only 48 hours after seeing a stage adaptation of Emma I was struck
how much Tatyana and her circle had in common with Jane Austen's small,
intensely-felt world of emotional ripening and developing moral awareness.
The later romanticism is all Tchaikovsky's own, and the Romanian production
team (director Ion Caramitru, designer Maria Miu) play up the element of
regretted opportunities, vanished hopes, unrecapturable youth. The St
Petersburg ballroom is full of ghosts - the tired nurse, Olga, Madame
Larina, the dead Lensky, his pistol raised as in that fatal duel - pass like
wraiths through the elegant dancers. As a way of dramatising an opera that
can unfold slowly on stage, whose conflicts are internal and psychological,
the production strikes a happy and tactful balance between theatricality and
the introspective beauties of the score.
The American Kimm Julian is a mature Onegin, a stiff avuncular figure,
perhaps a foretaste of one of Henry James's more icy creations, finely sung,
intelligently acted. Melanie Armitstead's dignified bearing and veiled vocal
quality were better with the grande dame than the impulsive girl. Mark
Beudert, another American, provided Lensky with Italianate tone, after
initially uncertain intonation, and made a handsome young poet. Kate
McCarney, a glamorous Olga, Colette McGahon's loving Larina and Enid
Hartle's experienced Nurse filled the lesser roles from strength.
Robust playing for Kenneth Montgomery was seconded by the splendid ONI
chorus, amazingly an amateur body. This recalls Welsh National Opera,
originally built around an amateur chorus, but WNO was able to grow through
the backup of English besides Welsh touring. Dreams of one central
organisation providing opera for Belfast, Dublin and Cork are still 'a
political hot potato'. Meanwhile ONI prepares a touring version of Don
Pasquale, looks forward to Elisir and aspires to next year's double of
Boheme and Cunning Little Vixen. As the company admits, Janacek is a
box-office risk, but 'it's the sort of opera that people can come to and
fall in love with'.

intimate Britten Theatre - I remember his Paul Bunyan and Onegin with
particular affection. He and the designer Bernard Culshaw have here found a
method of updating that comes across as a quickened imaginative response to
the musical and verbal text, not a lazy-minded gimmick.
The stage design is abstract, the dress modern, the narrative unfolding
elliptical; quick switches of lighting (by John Bishop) underscore the
emotional patterns. This is a production devised to make young performers
(including a splendidly controlled mixture of Christmas Eve revellers, adult
and children) feel at home, which sets up vital lines of connection between
past and present, Puccini's day and our own.
Of the first-night cast (there are three alternating sets of principals for
the six performances) the stand-out figure was the Rodolfo of an
astonishingly gifted young Chinese tenor, Ya-Lin Zhang. He needs to improve
further his Italian diction (which stood out the more because of the
impressively natural delivery around him), and to master much greater
flexibility of stage presence; his steady, supple tones, beautifully
unforced and romantic-sounding, hint at a remarkably bright future.
The Marcello, Richard Croft, shows himself a born singer-actor, alert in his
instincts, a natural point of focus on stage; the Musetta, Elizabeth
Davidson, shares the same quality. Other cast-members prove less noteworthy,
though no-one lets down the prevailing high standard. It's sometimes
difficult to know how to 'rate' enjoyable student opera-productions; at
least by the side of last autumn's dismal Glyndebourne Touring Boheme, this
one seems to me a plain triumph.

reminiscing in the foreground, is risked by the slow tempo; likewise M.
Triquet's birthday song, and the moment of relief it provides amid the
gathering tensions of the Larin ball. Accentuation of dance-rhythms is not
at all metrically mechanical; indeed, the conductor's rubato elasticities
may surprise the unwary. But even while I wondered at or where I questioned
the interpretative ideas, I felt the opera's dramatic vitality surging out
into the theatre. This is opera-conducting of rare quality.
Sergey Leiferkus (Onegin), Galina Gorchakova (Tatyana) and the Armenian
Gegam Grigorian (Lensky) are members or associates of Gergiev's Kirov
ensemble. The sense of singers supported from the pit, not merely
accompanied, is another of the performance's special virtues. The baritone,
a house favourite, is at his peak of eloquent, fine-grained artistry. Every
inflection tells. A non-Russian speaker gains the illusion of understanding
every word as it leaves his lips. He never loses the air of breeding that is
Onegin's distinguishing mark; even in disintegration he avoids melodramatic
overstatement.
The soprano, who burst upon London audiences with tidal-wave force in The
Fiery Angel, at the Proms and at Covent Garden, is possibly the most
opulent, lustrously full-toned Tatyana in living memory: again, truly Covent
Garden-sized without being oversized. She does not always shape the lines or
make them perfectly smooth; though physically plausible, she is a
sympathetic rather than an original, inventive actress. What she offers is a
restrained, ravishing account of the role, and in context wonderfully
appropriate.
Grigorian, a small, rotund Lensky with a vibrant, technically free tenor and
a heart-breaking openness of emotional expression, is all feeling - the
over-abundance of happiness in the Act 1 aria, beautifully caught in the
timbre and phrasing (and sustained in the conducting), sends out subtle,
alarming warning signals. It is satisfying to see and hear Louise Winter (a
delightfully spirited Olga), Sarah Walker (Filipyevna) and Gillian Knight
(Mme Larin) keeping pace with such idiomatic artistry; and as Gremin it is
peculiarly moving to see and hear again Nicolai Ghiaurov, no longer a basso
cantante in full flood but a 63-year-old veteran wise, colourful and full of
tender vocal touches.
A triumphant Royal Opera Onegin all round? No: the production - by John Cox
in Timothy O'Brien's designs - is plain to the eye, cautiously tactful,
blandly second-rate. No big mistakes are made (which, when one considers how
easy it is to go wrong in this opera - cf. Howard Davies's recent,
mistake-riddled Onegin staging for Welsh National - is a merciful relief).
Nothing gets in the way of the music. For many ROH patrons this may be
sufficient. With this conductor and cast, it deserves to be. But the
replacement of the old Julia Trevelyan Oman sets and costumes seems
unjustified.

OPERA REVIEW; 


SOUND BETTER THAN SIGHT IN MET'S DUSTY 'ONEGIN' 




By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 




NEW YORK 




"Yevgeny Onegin" as staged these days at the Metropolitan Opera isn't exactly a 
triumph of modern musical theater. 


The semi-whimsical sets of Rolf Gerard looked quaintly tacky when they were 
new, and that was in 1957. The costumes of Ray Diffen resemble afterthoughts, 
which they are. Under the dubious circumstances, one can hardly blame the 
latest stage director on duty, Bodo Igesz, for concentrating on safe and 
familiar traffic maneuvers. 


Luckily, Tchaikovsky's intimate setting of the Pushkin verse novel can triumph 
over a dusty production if it happens to be acted with conviction, sung with 
fervor and, perhaps most important, conducted with a sense of brooding passion. 
In these crucial respects, the forces at Lincoln Center performed nobly on 
Saturday. 


Ironically, the primary hero of the afternoon hadn't even been scheduled to be 
there. If all had gone as planned, the man in the pit would have been Andrew 
Litton. The operatic neophyte was felled by appendicitis, however, at the first 
performance. Subsequently, his baton has been taken up by none less than the 
illustrious artistic director of the company, James Levine. 


Even though he had presided over an exhausting and exhaustive "Walkure" just a 
few hours earlier, Levine brought freshness, urgency and lyrical expansion to 
his inherited duties. It had been rumored that he agreed to serve as substitute 
maestro as a special favor for -- or tribute to -- his celebrated Tatiana, 
Mirella Freni. 


The tender orchestral bouquets he laid at her feet lent credence to the rumors. 
Levine breathed in unison with the soprano. He adjusted tempos liberally yet 
sensibly to accommodate every nuance in her particularly poignant Letter Scene. 
He gave her the sensitive support she deserved as she floated shimmering arcs 
of pianissimo tone in the final scene. This, indeed, was artistic 
communication, and collaboration, of a high order. 


As she already proved in San Francisco, Freni is an extraordinarily 
sympathetic, pensive yet impetuous, ultimately noble Tatiana. Not incidentally, 
she manages to create a staggering illusion of girlish innocence at the decent 
age of 54. 


On this occasion one could notice that a few climactic outbursts escaped ideal 
focus. Also, if measured by the most authentic Bolshoi standards, Freni's 
Tatiana remains rather Italianate. In this musico-dramatic context, it really 
didn't matter. 


Jorma Hynninen, who happens to serve as general manager of the Finnish National 
Opera, complemented her as an Onegin of fierce elegance, muted ardor and, where 
appropriate, bel-canto finesse. 


Jerry Hadley brought comparable delicacy and pathos to the painful reveries of 
Lensky. Michel Senechal offered a small tenoral revelation of his own by 
imbuing the serenade of old Monsieur Triquet with poetry rather than the usual 
buffo distortions. 


The lower voices proved less impressive. Hans Sotin made a rather bumpy ride of 
Prince Gremin's marvelous aria, the final descending phrase evaporating short 
of its intended destination. Sandra Walker seemed properly giddy in manner but 
somewhat lightweight in sound as Olga. Conversely, Gweneth Bean overpowered the 
grandmotherly mutterings of the nurse with an orotund contralto worthy of our 
friend Erda. Ariel Bybee reduced Mme. Larina to a pallid sketch. 


The functional but stilted and awkwardly integrated dance episodes were 
overseen by Norbert Vesak. Perhaps he ought to put in some time studying the 
anthological models of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" at the Imperial Theatre.

AT Christmas 1892, Tchaikovsky's present to the world was a unique
double-bill: one half opera, the other half ballet. The idea met with public
success at the time, but since then the two parts have followed separate and
very different paths: The Nutcracker has risen to become one of the
favourite ballets of the world, while the opera Iolanta (or Yolande) has
sunk into obscurity, at least outside Russia.
What better idea than to re-unite these long-lost siblings? The Edinburgh
festival has taken Tchaikovsky as its central theme this year and the
programming of both opera and ballet on the same evening promised certainly
novelty, probably education, and hopefully enjoyment. Opera North, with its
fine track-record of reviving neglected operas, was entrusted with Iolanta.
That started the evening, as Tchaikovsky intended.
The story was one with which the composer had long been enchanted. In
Iolanta, the blind princess kept from the truth about her lack of sight, he
had found an ideal person on whom to lavish his artistic affection. Like
Tatyana in Eugene Onegin, his most vital operatic creation, she is again a
blameless young woman, who has yet to discover the realities of the adult
world.
Whenever Iolanta is on stage, the music pulses with inspiration, welling up
to those insistently-repetitive Tchaikovsky climaxes that set the heart
racing. Though not in her best voice right through the evening, Joan Rodgers
easily made her portrayal the shining virtue of the performance. Clad in
virginal white, she played Iolanta not as a fey creature of myth, but as a
human being in embryo, facing the beginnings of real emotion.
Unfortunately, her appearances are interspersed with substantial sections in
which the pace falters. Each of the subsidiary characters is allowed his or
her aria. The opera moves disjointedly from one to the next and, despite the
advocacy of David Lloyd-Jones in the pit, there was no disguising
Tchaikovsky's inability to breathe life into the other shadowy fairy-tale
figures.
The most strongly-felt is the king and father, played by Norman Bailey,
whose voice no longer takes kindly to the stretching, angst-ridden vocal
lines that the role is allotted. The hero Vaudemont was fearlessly sung by
Kim Begley, but he was so stiff physically that he greeted ecstasy and
tragedy alike with the same lack of interest.
Robert Hayward turned his travelling companion into the archetypal Victorian
cad, full of his own bravado singing. The smaller roles were not generally
well taken.
The production by Martin Duncan dipped its toe into stylisation, but wisely
withdrew it to present the main characters with a semblance of realism. The
visual setting, comprising an all-white tree dropping multi-coloured leaves
over the stage, courtesy of the designer Anthony Ward, was already
self-consciously arty enough.
Altogether, a lesser achievement on the part of all concerned than one might
have hoped. It was after the interval that the eyes really were to be
opened.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN; 


A LITTLE TRAVELING MUSIC, PLEASE, FOR THIS MAESTRO 




By KENNETH HERMAN 




Thanks to conductor David Amos, some of San Diego's most notable music-making 
this month will take place in London. Working with three local musical 
colleagues -- violist Karen Elaine, baritone Sheldon Merel and San Diego State 
University resident composer David Ward-Steinman -- the globe-trotting Amos 
will make three recordings of American music with three London orchestras. 


Known locally as the music director of the Jewish Community Center Orchestra, 
Amos began recording in Israel several years ago. When he completes the London 
project, Amos will have made seven recordings this year, a respectable tally 
for a conductor not connected with a major orchestra. 


By offering record companies musical programs off the beaten track -- Amos does 
not see his own complete Beethoven symphony series in the offing -- the San 
Diego conductor has found his niche. Labor costs in England, Israel and Poland, 
where Amos made two recordings in June, are significantly lower than comparable 
costs in the United States, so recording companies can afford to speculate on 
this type of music. 


Amos has specialized in music written by composers he knows and with whom he 
has worked. 


"If you are looking for music to record, the best method is to ask a composer 
which of his compositions he thinks has been undeservedly neglected," Amos 
said. Ward-Steinman, for example, was eager to have his Chamber Concerto No. 2 
preserved on disc. Amos and the City Sinfonia of London are recording it this 
afternoon for Harmonia Mundi records, with the composer on hand to offer his 
interpretive counsel. 


Another composition on the Ward-Steinman disc will be Norman Dello Joio's 
"Lyric Fantasies," with Elaine performing the viola solo. Dello Joio, a 
Pulitzer prize-winner and one of the elder statesmen of U.S. composers, wrote 
"Lyric Fantasies," which is really a viola concerto, in 1973. Amos spoke with 
the retired composer while he was preparing his conductor's score for the 
upcoming recording session. 


Merel, longtime cantor at San Diego's Congregation Beth Israel, will perform 
the vocal solos in Alan Hovhaness' "Shepherd of Israel," to be recorded with 
London's Philharmonia Orchestra. Amos has recorded several of the 
Armenian-American composer's works recently, including a critically 
well-received account of Hovhaness' "And God Created Great Whales." 


A busy recording schedule is the bread and butter of the various London 
orchestras, but according to Amos, the British musicians keep a good sense of 
humor about the nonstop projects. But they are sufficiently jaded to size up a 
guest conductor very quickly. 


"I once asked a London concertmaster (the British call them 'leaders') how long 
it typically took the musicians to evaluate a conductor once he started a 
rehearsal. 'We know if he'll be any good before he steps on the podium,' was 
the unhesitating reply." 


Vocal relief. While most U.S. opera houses are well into their fall 
productions, local opera buffs must mark time until San Diego Opera's season 
opens in January. Temporary relief is in sight, however, with a pair of vocal 
recitals sponsored by the local company at La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium. 
Sunday at 7 p.m., German tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz will make his American 
recital debut, and the following Sunday, Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky 
will sing his only West Coast recital this fall. 


Blochwitz, who made his stage debut in 1984 as Lensky in Tchaikovsky's "Eugene 
Onegin," made his Metropolitan Opera debut last month in Mozart's "Don 
Giovanni." As Don Ottavio, a role he will sing for San Diego Opera in 1993, New 
York Times music critic Donal Henahan praised Blochwitz for "his silvery tone 
and a pliantly phrased 'Dalla sua pace' ." For the San Francisco Opera, 
Blochwitz sang Idamante in Mozart's "Idomeneo." 


Sunday's program will be devoted to two complete song cycles, Schubert's "Die 
schone Mullerin" and Robert Schumann's "Dichterliebe." Blochwitz will be 
accompanied by Australian pianist Peter Grunberg. Although the Hvorostovsky 
recital is sold out, some tickets are available from the opera office for 
Blochwitz. 


Requiem for Rozsnyai. The San Diego Symphony's Oct. 19 performance of Gabriel 
Faure's Requiem will be dedicated to Zoltan Rozsnyai, who died last month. The 
symphony's music director from 1976-71, Rozsnyai conducted the orchestra's 
first commercial recording. Current music director Yoav Talmi will conduct this 
performance of the Requiem, assisted by the La Jolla Civic-University Chorus, 
soprano Sivan Rotem and baritone Hector Vasquez. 


Another new music director. Kerry Duse will fill the post left vacant by the 
recent death of Zoltan Rozsnyai. Duse has been rehearsing the International 
Orchestra at United States International University for the last few weeks and 
will make his debut in his new role with the ensemble Dec. 14, 8 p.m., in La 
Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium. 


At USIU, Duse has directed more than 30 musical-theater productions and has 
also conducted ballet and pops concerts with the International Orchestra. 
Before his association with USIU, the California native spent five years as 
music director of Canada's Royal Winnipeg Ballet. He had a similar post with 
the Banff Festival Ballet and was principal pianist with Switzerland's Geneva 
Opera.

opera-goers through the recent ENO staging of Rimsky-Korsakov's later
setting of the story, was clarified at the QEH in Arthur Jacobs's lively
translation.
Three singers stood out. With a husky mezzo, Ann Atkinson was delightful as
the witch Solokha, and Jonathan Veira sang robustly and with relish as the
Devil. Peter Sidhom was a splendid, solemn Potemkin. Though taxed by the
demanding role of Oxana, Alice Hyde made a credible heroine - and the slight
edge to her voice suggested authentic Russian tone.
Both the Vakula and Chub, roles requiring larger-than-life singers, were
undercharacterised. The conductor, Martyn Brabbins, welded his forces -
including a ragged chorus - with flair and Tchaikovskian feeling.

GIANT tone, powerful voices, larger-than-life performances: that sums up the
Bolshoy Opera, whose visit to Lucerne this month was the undisputed high
point of the festival. It was an extraordinary meeting of opposites - the
extravagant Bolshoy style and the undemonstrative orderliness of this neat
Swiss city. Even without the visual enhancement of staged productions, the
Bolshoy concerts were full of drama and roof-raising sound, more attuned to
the company's big Moscow home than Lucerne's modest Kunsthaus. Here was a
different tradition - not just well-preserved, but bristling with vitality
and excitement.
Since the Gorbachev reforms, the Bolshoy has been overshadowed in western
eyes by the Kirov, thanks to the St Petersburg company's growing links with
Britain's Royal Opera, its recent recordings and the independent reputation
established by its artists. The Bolshoy has always seemed the more
monolithic institution, known less for personalities than politics and
spectacle. It made its British debut in Glasgow and Edinburgh three years
ago, but the visit was dogged by technical problems. Lacking a big theatre,
Lucerne dispensed with the old-fashioned splendour of the Bolshoy's
stagings, and made do with concert performances of Rakhmaninov's Aleko,
Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Yevgeny Onegin.
What impressed was not so much the quality of individual singers or
instrumental sections, but the overall excellence. These were company
performances through-and-through, conducted with no-nonsense authority and
balletic energy by the Bolshoy's music director, Alexander Lazarev. The
sheer unanimity of ensemble and size of tone were breathtaking.
Equally striking was the arrival of a new, younger generation of solo
singers: no ageing, spreading sopranos or wobbly basses here. The singers
looked their parts, Pavel Chernykh's handsome Onegin as much as Vladimir
Matorin's formidably bearded gypsy father in Aleko. They also coloured and
projected the words as only Russians can in their native tongue, blending
their voices and reactions in the manner of a seasoned ensemble. And these
were without exception big voices, part of an historic national tradition,
selected for their ability to penetrate the furthest corners of the Bolshoy
Theatre. Nowhere else will you find voices of such amplitude today.
Pride of place went to Maria Gavrilova, the unflamboyant Semfira in Aleko
and dignified Tatyana in Onegin, a classic Russian lirico-spinto soprano
with bright, forward tone. Her virile tenor partner in Aleko was Oleg Kulko;
in Onegin the sweet-voiced Lensky was Arkady Mishenkin. All the leading
baritones, including Nicolai Reshelniak's Aleko, sang with more thrust than
warmth; Yuri Vedenyev had the best opportunity of all in the Duke of
Burgundy's aria in Iolanta, bringing out its dramatic fervour without a
trace of self-indulgence. Irina Bikulova may have lacked the ideal vocal
purity for the blind princess Iolanta, but her duet with Vladimir Bogachev's
impassioned Vaudemont was suitably open-hearted: these Russian singers are
not afraid to express strong emotions. And among the excellent comprimarios,
there was a golden-haired, golden-voiced young bass, Maxim Mikhailov, who is
clearly destined for greater things.
Aleko, a one-act graduation piece drawn from a narrative poem by Pushkin and
premiered at the Bolshoy in 1893, benefited least from the concert setting:
its episodic musical character really needs the stage colour of the gypsy
setting, and it proved a pale companion-piece for Rakhmaninov's Second
Symphony. Iolanta, Tchaikovsky's last, shortest and most benign opera,
offered less scope for the imagination than Onegin, in which the musical
drama easily compensated for the concert setting. The spontaneous standing
ovation which the normally sedate Lucerne audience accorded the Onegin cast
was fully deserved.
Change has come slowly and steadily to the Bolshoy since the fall of
communism. The ease with which talented younger singers can rise to the top
is one of the more obvious developments. Another is the drop in political
interference. According to Vitaly Fomin, the company's commercial director,
the Bolshoy is now self-governing and receives its state subsidy direct from
the Ministry of Finance, amounting to 70 per cent of the budget. Another
five per cent comes from private sponsors - wealthy Russian individuals who
have revived the pre-1917 tradition of supporting the arts without expecting
something in return.
The Bolshoy is also learning to sell itself in the market place. It has
signed a deal with Britain's National Video Corporation for films of The
Maid of Orleans, A Life for the Tsar and Mlada. It has entered a
co-production arrangement with Genoa for Prince Igor, one of two new opera
stagings to be shown in Moscow in the coming season (the other is May
Night). The touring schedule has increased: the Bolshoy Ballet is currently
in Japan; and the orchestra - which has already toured Germany and
Switzerland this year, visits Britain this month and the US in October and
November.
But old habits die hard. The payroll is as big as ever: the Bolshoy still
has well over 2500 employees, including a social welfare programme that
embraces a kindergarten, hospital and Black Sea health resort. The number of
performing artists alone runs to 1000, including more than 70 principal
singers. All are salaried staff. Although soloists are given leave for guest
contracts in the West, no-one has left the company since the fall of
communism - in striking comparison to the Kirov. Such is the proud sense of
company identity.
The downside is that singers feel no obligation to give a minimum number of
performances. 'We hope to settle this problem in the coming season, so that
artists know their repertoire-plan in advance, and can organise their
foreign work around it' says Fomin. 'But we have no intention of reducing
the number of staff. We don't have unnecessary fat, and we appreciate the
work of each person in the theatre. This is their home.'
The Bolshoy Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Lazarev, plays in 14 British
cities over the coming month, including Glasgow tonight, Birmingham (Sept
21/22), London's Barbican Centre (27) and Cardiff (Sept 30 and Oct 4). It
also tours the US from Oct 23 to Nov 17.

joined a gala chorus, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and conductor
David Pryce-Jones for 'A Gala Tribute to Sir Geraint,' a concert whose
proceeds will benefit this fund.
Every good gala should have its surprise; this once had an unknown Verdi
aria. Dennis O'Neill, who has sung Foresto in Verdi's Attila at Covent
Garden, introduced an alternative aria that in 1846 Verdi wrote, at
Rossini's request, for the tenor Ivanoff to sing. The aria, 'Sventurato]
Della mia vita', was never published; O'Neill is the first since Ivanoff to
sing it. He sings it well, and it deserves to become better known.
Everything about it says, splendidly, 'Verdi' - the mixture of legato and
staccati in the arching vocal lines; the staccati triplets that quietly,
feelingly, accompany the initial phrases; the woodwind that join in and link
it to the particular sound-world of Attila's more lyrical scenes; the
orchestral tutti that join its swelling climax; the muted orchestral close
straight after the tenor's final high note.
In case we needed reminding, the gala demonstrated the strength of Welsh
singing. O'Neill, who planned and organised the gala, also sang Lensky's
aria from Eugene Onegin with elegiac beauty, and joined Margaret Price in
the love-duet from Verdi's Otello. Price, whose pure entry into notes
remains phenomenal, later sang Desdemona's Willow Song and Ave Maria, making
every phrase, every word, count. I love the way she makes the first calls of
'Salce]' sound like a distant voice, and how she matches her phrasing here
to the oboe.
Della Jones, fresh from her Proms appearance the previous night, sang the
rondo finale from Rossini's Cenerentola with sparkling aplomb. True, her
divisions and top notes are not as breathtakingly clean as they were 10 or
15 years ago, but this is still a wonderfully exciting account of this
irresistible scene (here given with a little joke cadenza referring to the
gala's previous aria, 'Non piu andrai'). I have space only to mention and
praise the contributions of Gwynne Howell (in music from Onegin and Don
Carlo), Arthur Davies (fresh from the Covent Garden opening-night Butterfly,
singing the Carmen Flower Song), Jason Howard (in Posa's death scene from
Don Carlo) and Rebecca Evans (in Susanna's aria from Figaro).
Most glorious of them all, Bryn Terfel. When Caruso heard Lotte Lehmann, he
complimented her by saying 'Brava - una vera voce voce italiana': which
leaps to my mind as I hear Terfel today. His baritone, so secure, is placed
that you hear his whole body and face in every phrase; he has spontaneity,
virility, force, individuality. He sang 'Non piu andrai' from Figaro, and
the Honour monologue from Verdi's Falstaff - both Geraint Evans roles, both
here given immense panache. Yes, in the latter opera he has been singing
Ford (and only the night before in Cardiff); he has already all the
eloquence for Falstaff.
It was a smart touch to end each half of the gala with a big ensemble. The
sextet from Donizetti's Lucia preceded the interval; but it was effaced by
the great fugue from Falstaff, which brought together all the evening's
soloists: Margaret Price as Alice, Della Jones as Meg, and so on. The
intricacy of Verdi's writing, and the bubbling glee with which his music is
shot through, have seldom been more apparent.

touch sullied (by a cold, I guess), but excellent technique left her mastery
of Mozart style unscathed. Mary Hegarty as the shepherdess Elisa, though a
less careful vocalist, beams out a ray of sunlight with her bright, sweet,
unforced tones.
The two tenors, Martyn Hill and Philip Salmon, cover skilfully their passing
moments of dryness; Patricia Bardon's rich mezzo is too weighty for Mozart's
seconda donna soprano role. Daniel's conducting tends to bustle the early
stages of the work along - with this production unfolding before his eyes,
who can blame him? There-after the balance between Mozartian energy and
Mozartian grace is more securely held.

MUSIC; 


KAVAKOS BRINGS FIREWORKS TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 




By JOHN HENKEN 




The annual Tchaikovsky Spectacular at Hollywood Bowl is thoroughly familiar, 
and everyone knows what familiarity breeds. But over the years the beloved old 
pyromaniac's delight has also created the cheering expectation of musical 
fireworks in the pre-intermission concerto spot. 


Such anticipation was rewarded again in the latest enactment of the ritual, 
courtesy of young Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos. In his Bowl debut, he 
applied rousing sound, potent technique and an interpretation of occasionally 
disconcerting eccentricity to the Violin Concerto. 


Kavakos began slowly, with the odd mixture of deliberation and dreamy eloquence 
that characterized his approach to the lyrical material. In the bravura 
conflagrations he proved technically precise, but his phrasing and bowing were 
sufficiently idiosyncratic to lose conductor Gerard Schwarz and the supporting 
Seattle Symphony at times in the first movement. 


In all, Kavakos produced a big-sounding, emotionally engaging performance. 
Schwarz backed him with generally lithe, balanced and pertinently detailed 
accompaniment. 


Schwarz and his visiting orchestra had to themselves the familiar charms of the 
Polonaise from "Eugene Onegin" and the "Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy. The 
Polonaise danced blithely enough, and the ensemble's lean, dark sound -- 
illuminated by gleaming brass -- and articulate rhythmicality projected much of 
the drama of the tone poem. But Schwarz somehow left "Romeo and Juliet" overall 
a prosaic, unconnected experience of surprisingly low energy. 


In the increasingly anticlimactic "1812" Overture, Schwarz's company was 
enlarged by the USC Trojan Band. The orchestra dispatched the introductory 
solemnities with minimal rhetoric, and the assembled throng accompanied the 
fireworks diligently. JOHN HENKEN

1988 THE YEAR IN REVIEW; 


DANCE 




By CHRIS PASLES 




Was 1988 the year of the dead in the Orange County arts scene? Well, it was the 
year Pacific Symphony conductor Keith Clark was termed "a dead fish," the year 
William Shakespeare was nearly a dead duck in Garden Grove and the year the 
rock zanies in Oingo Boingo held yet another "Dead Man's Party" at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre. 


 Jokes notwithstanding, there were encouraging signs of life locally. South 
Coast Repertory Theatre won major national recognition with the 1988 Tony Award 
as best regional theater in the country. The Grove Theatre Co. triumphed over 
considerable civic adversity that threatened for a time to shut down the 
county's only annual Shakespeare festival. The Pacific Symphony demonstrated 
new enthusiasm, with concerts led by guest conductors vying for the 
soon-to-be-vacated music director post. 


Local rock bands seemed to flourish, live and on record, despite a paucity of 
clubs in the county that would book them or radio stations that would air their 
music. The Improv in Irvine paved the way for a significant increase in the 
quantity and quality of stand-up comedy in the county. 


 With that in mind, in the following four pages critics for The Times Orange 
County Edition offer compendiums of the best -- and in some cases, the worst 
and the silliest -- that the county had to offer during the year in art, music, 
dance, theater, pop and comedy. 


 *International star Fernando Bujones danced Lensky in John Cranko's "Onegin" 
as a guest with the National Ballet of Canada, June 7 to 12, at the Center. But 
the company was not lacking in its own roster of dancers. Among a trio of 
casts, Sabina Allemann was a most lyric, expressive Tatiana, and Frank Augustyn 
a cold, world-weary Onegin. 


The Canadians also brought Glen Tetley's "Alice," with Kimberly Glasco as a 
melting Young Alice and Rex Harrington as a Byronic Lewis Carroll. 


As a curtain-raiser, the company danced no less than Balanchine's profound "The 
Four Temperaments" -- and danced it superbly. 


*Merche Esmeralda brought demonic power, shattering intensity to "Medea" during 
the Royal Spanish National Ballet run at the Center, Aug. 2 to 7. 


*American Ballet Theatre unveiled a costly new staging of "Swan Lake" by 
company artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov during its Nov. 29 to Dec. 11 run 
at the Center. Five pairs of Swan Queens and Siegfrieds danced in Orange 
County. 


ABT excelled in Balanchine's masterpiece, "Stravinsky Violin Concerto." 


Also during ABT's run, three former members of Twyla Tharp Dance company (Kevin 
O'Day, Jamie Bishton and Daniel Sanchez) -- folded into the New York company 
now that Tharp is artistic associate of ABT -- appeared in her inventive, 
virtuoso "The Fugue," danced to silence. 


*The dance department at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa sponsored two dance 
and music events in October and netted about $3,000 to benefit ACTION (AIDS 
Coalition to Identify Orange County Needs), a 4-year-old grass-roots 
organization that provides educational services and coordinates informational 
meetings for the public, among other aims. 


Participating groups included Rhapsody in Taps (formerly LTD/Dance Unlimited), 
the Gloria Newman Dance Theatre, Ecos de Espana, Middle Eastern dancer Angelika 
Nemeth and composer Lisbeth Woodies. CHRIS PASLES
