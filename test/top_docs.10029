HUNGARY TO BE PROCLAIMED REPUBLIC ON REVOLT ANNIVERSARY 




From United Press International 




BUDAPEST, Hungary 




Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation Friday providing for Hungary's 
first free elections in 42 years and agreed to proclaim Hungary a republic on 
Monday -- the anniversary of the 1956 revolution crushed by Soviet tanks. 


In a dramatic climax to a week in which numerous measures were adopted to 
transform Hungary from a one-party Communist state to a Western-style 
democracy, the Parliament voted to declare Oct. 23 a national day of 
commemoration. 


It also accepted the recommendation of Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth that 
Speaker Matyas Szuros declare Hungary a republic from the balcony of Parliament 
at noon Monday -- precisely 33 years after the first mass demonstrations for 
political reforms that were put down by the Soviet army. 


The vote on the electoral law was 286-to-20 with 24 abstentions after extensive 
debate on how many candidates should be elected on individual merit and how 
many as members of political parties. 


In propelling Hungary toward Western-style democracy, the lawmakers also 
declared a rehabilitation for all who were declared guilty of political crimes 
and interned "in an unlawful manner" between 1945 and 1963. 


The legislators asked the government to provide a proposal on paying damages to 
those who suffered for their political views. It is estimated that between 1949 
and 1953 alone, 1 million people -- more than 10% of the population -- suffered 
in some manner because of their political beliefs. 


Lawmakers also voted overwhelmingly Friday to disband the dreaded Workers 
Militia. The 60,000-strong volunteer armed police force was created after the 
1956 uprising by the now-defunct Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, or 
Communist Party. Communist reformists dissolved the Socialist Workers Party 
earlier this month and created the new Hungarian Socialist Party. 


The upcoming elections will be the first free elections since 1947, when the 
various political parties were allowed to run candidates.

  [Text] Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which, according to the 
results so far, is in the lead, evaluated the first round of the 
elections at party headquarters in Republic Square. 
  [Begin Szekeres recording] Something important has happened 
today in Hungary. At the second free elections, finally, and 
once and for all, Hungary has became a democratic country. Very 
many citizens, much more than expected, have participated in the 
elections and no significant irregularity occurred today. 
Whatever the result of the elections, the point is that this 
decision has been made: Hungary, once and for all, became a 
democratic country. 
  The MSZP hopes that when the ballot boxes are opened and the 
votes counted, it will be the MSZP with the largest number of 
votes. We hope that in the next three weeks the style and 
content of the election campaign will change. We decided to 
maintain the style, political content, and ideology that have 
been represented by the MSZP candidates in the past weeks. This 
is a calm and moderate political style dealing with the problems 
of society and seeking professional solutions. We would like 
for Hungary, after the second round of elections on 29 May, to 
have a politically moderate and viable government. [end

 [TA SR report: "Coalition Alternatives"] 
  [Text] Cadca -- All Slovak National Party [SNS] District 
Councils in Slovakia have quickly recovered from the departure 
of some members for the National Democratic Party--New 
Alternative. Since the Extraordinary SNS Assembly, which was 
held in Zilina in February, party membership has increased from 
6,000 to approximately 6,700. This was stated by the SNS 
Central Council during a meeting in Cadca on Saturday [9 April]. 
Information on the meeting was provided by SNS Chairman Jan 
Slota and SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes. 
  The SNS Central Council also considered the possibilities of 
forming a coalition for the upcoming parliamentary elections. 
The proposal was put forward to form a coalition partnership 
with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], but only in 
the event of the formation of pre-election blocs --a left-wing 
bloc, a right-wing bloc, and a national bloc. 
  The SNS Central Council protests against the decision by 
Slovak President Michal Kovac to annul the results of citizens' 
petition for a referendum. The president preferred intrigues to 
a democratic solution to the problem, delegates stated in their 
contributions. 
  The SNS Central Council issued a statement on the political 
situation, which it addressed to the citizens of Slovakia. It 
states, among other things: "A dangerous development has 
occurred on the Slovak political scene. Under the formal cloak 
of democracy, political culture and ethics have been trampled 
underfoot, the regular results of the free elections of 1992 
have been reversed, and power has been seized by political 
entities that were either defeated in the free elections or did 
not even exist at that time. This situation is reminiscent of 
the elections of 1948 when Klement Gottwald usurped power in the 
former Czechoslovak Republic.... 
  "Political purges have been set in motion and an endeavor 
has 
been launched to liquidate the sole opposition daily, REPUBLIKA. 
There is speculation that the September election date might be 
postponed," the statement says. A dirty role is played in this 
process by a greater part of the mass media. 
  The present government's distrust of the Slovak Republic's 
independence is borne out by its downright Milovy-style 
capitulationism [reference to February 1992 draft treaty 
concluded between Czech and Slovak leaders in Milovy on the 
future shape of Czech-Slovak coexistence, which was subsequently 
rejected by Slovak Parliament as capitulationist] in its 
negotiations with the Czech Republic in the Customs Union 
Council, as a result of which the Slovak Republic will incur 
losses of hundreds of millions of korunas. It is borne out by 
the secret agreements between the current government coalition 
and Hungarian political parties that do not conceal their 
irredentism. The SNS emphatically demands the publication of 
these agreements. Citizens of the Slovak Republic have the 
right to get to know their contents. In conclusion, the SNS 
appeals to citizens not to yield to hopelessness and apathy and 
to express their attitude toward the Slovak Republic in the next 
elections.

possibly, the Christian Social Union. Slota also reiterates the 
party's demand for the publication of the agreement concluded 
between the government coalition and the Hungarian political 
parties, saying that "the Slovak nation wants to know for how 
many Judas's silverlings it was concluded." In his concluding 
reply, Slota denies that the SNS leadership would meet with 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia, during his expected visit to Slovakia. "We did not 
invite him to Slovakia and do not consider establishing any 
contacts with him," Slota says.]

E. GERMANY READY TO TALK ABOUT FREE ELECTIONS 




By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




EAST BERLIN 




East Germany's ruling Politburo on Wednesday proposed talks with opposition 
elements about free elections, saying such negotiations could deal with the 
organization of elections in which the party could be voted out of power. 


The Politburo also said it is willing to discuss changes to the 1949 
constitution, which enshrines the Communist Party's position as the major 
political force in the nation. Members did not propose a specific date for the 
talks, nor did they indicate which groups they were willing to bring into 
discussions. 


In addition to the Communist Party, with more than 2 million members, there are 
four smaller political parties in East Germany. In the past, they had been 
considered mere satellites of the Communists, but since the recent political 
upheaval began they have been showing startling independence. 


But other non-party opposition groups have sprung up recently, notably New 
Forum, which now claims 200,000 followers. 


According to the official news agency ADN, "The Politburo has proposed that the 
political parties united in the coalition government should convene a round 
table with other political forces." 


The proposal in many ways resembles similar ones in Poland and Hungary, which 
resulted in the ouster of the Communist Party as the sole political force. 


Manfred Gerlach, leader of the small Liberal Democratic Party, told a news 
conference Wednesday that his party is drafting an electoral law ensuring free 
elections at all levels, including the national Parliament. He said the new law 
should be put to a referendum, with the actual elections held late next year or 
early in 1991. 


East German leader Egon Krenz, who also heads the Communist Party, earlier had 
spoken of a dialogue with opposition groups, but he had not gone as far as 
offering formal negotiations, which was implicit in the Politburo announcement 
Wednesday. 


In an interview with Moscow News on Wednesday, Krenz was quoted as suggesting 
that some of the ousted Communist Party leaders should be held to account for 
their abuses of power. 


"As far as the complicated processes taking place in this country are 
concerned," Krenz said, "neither workers nor peasants nor civil servants are 
guilty. The responsibility for everything has been taken by the party -- 
specifically, by those who retired from the Politburo and the government. I 
advocate bringing to account those who are really guilty of the situation that 
has arisen." 


At the same time, a Defense Ministry announcement said East Germany will do 
away with military parades that were characterized by goose-stepping soldiers. 


"Parades for self-glorification are not necessary," Defense Minister Theodor 
Hoffmann said. 


Hoffmann said he planned to restructure the 172,000-member armed forces, 
reducing the number of border guards.

BRIEFING PAPER; 


YUGOSLAVIA: A CENTER THAT ISN'T HOLDING 




By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




The News: 


Yugoslavian President Borislav Jovic has called for a new federal constitution 
and negotiations among the six member republics to prevent a breakup of the 
multinational state. Its future is threatened by an epidemic of nationalism, a 
power struggle between Communists and pro-democracy forces, secession movements 
in Slovenia and Croatia and looming economic threats including a rise in 
unemployment already at 17%. For many, the question is no longer whether the 
fragile federation will collapse, but when. 




The Background: 


National rivalries among the Balkan nations have never been resolved. Eight 
fractious kingdoms and provinces were merged in 1918 after the collapse of the 
Austro-Hungarian and Turkish Ottoman empires after World War I. Political and 
ethnic conflicts escalated into civil war by the 1940s. 


Communist partisan Josip Broz Tito emerged to lead the federation after World 
War II and managed through personal influence and political repression to keep 
nationalist outbreaks in check. The constitution drafted six years before his 
death in 1980 bequeathed a rotating system of leadership designed to prevent 
any of the six republics or two autonomous provinces from dominating. But 
Serbian-orchestrated changes to the constitution in March, 1989, stripped the 
province of Kosovo of its autonomy, triggering riots by majority Albanians and 
a crackdown by Serbs who are less than 10% of Kosovo's 2 million population. 


Adding to the nationalist tensions is the uneven development of democracy in 
Yugoslavia. Slovenia and Croatia, the two most prosperous and westernized 
republics, held multi-party elections this spring that brought in 
anti-Communist governments. Three of the other four republics -- 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia -- have scheduled free elections 
later this year. Serbia, however, remains a hard-line Communist state and has 
resisted calls for pluralism. A democratic vote would unquestionably restore 
Kosovo to ethnic Albanian control. 




At Issue: 


While most of the republics have shifted toward Western-style democracy, the 
federal government retains a Communist monopoly on political power even though 
it has undertaken market-oriented economic reforms. Prime Minister Ante 
Markovic has called for nationwide free elections by the end of the year and 
has said he may form a new party to challenge his fellow Communists. But 
federal elections cannot be held before all republics have legalized opposition 
parties and begun the transition to multi-party democracies. The Markovic 
appeal has put new pressure on Serbia to relax its one-party rule. 




Personalities: 


Serbian Communist Party chief Slobodan Milosevic rose to power by engineering 
the constitutional changes last year that imposed Serbian authority on Kosovo, 
the historic heartland of the medieval kingdom of Serbia. The move bolstered 
national pride among Serbs, who account for 9 million of Yugoslavia's 23 
million citizens, but touched off recurring ethnic clashes with Albanians who 
want their own republic in Kosovo. 


Federal President Jovic is a hard-line Communist Serb allied with Milosevic and 
likewise opposed to multi-party democracy. He has warned that rising 
nationalism threatens to escalate into civil war. 


Prime Minister Markovic, a Croat, is the first strong federal figure to emerge 
in Yugoslavia since Tito. He is popular for taming hyper-inflation and 
introducing market-oriented reforms that have eased Yugoslavia's economic 
crisis. 


While Markovic struggles to keep the federation together, strong nationalist 
figures have emerged in the largest republics. Franjo Tudjman, a Croatian 
nationalist and former dissident, was elected republic president last month. 
Vuk Draskovic of the unsanctioned and strongly nationalist Serbian Renewal 
Party is providing a magnet for Serbs disillusioned with communism. 




Scenarios: 


Serbia clears the federal reform roadblock by scheduling multi-party elections, 
but only after rewriting the republic's constitution to prevent Kosovo's ever 
gaining republic status; the most likely move, but one expected to trigger a 
bloody uprising by ethnic Albanians. 


* Serbia legalizes opposition parties but outlaws the Democratic League 
supported by Kosovo Albanians; also likely to set off rioting. 


* Serbia is forced in negotiations with the other republics to agree to free 
elections without restricting Kosovo's status; considered unlikely due to the 
Serbs' strong national identification with Kosovo. 


* No elections are set in Serbia, delaying federal pluralism and further 
fueling the secessionist movements in Croatia and Slovenia and leading to the 
breakup of Yugoslavia. 


* One of the newly democratized republics declares independence from the 
federation, and the army under the control of the Serbian-dominated presidency 
is brought in to prevent secession, unleashing civil war.

HUNGARY HOLDS 1ST FREE VOTE SINCE 1945 




By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




BUDAPEST, Hungary 




Incomplete results in the first free national vote here since 1945 narrowly 
favored supporters of Communist Party reformer Imre Pozsgay, who hopes to be 
elected Hungarian president in elections in January. 


But freezing temperatures and snow delayed conclusive results in the 
referendum, called by pro-Western political parties in an attempt to block 
Pozsgay by delaying the January elections until multi-party parliamentary 
elections are held next spring. 


With only 23% of the vote counted by early this morning, government officials 
said that 52% voted against delaying the election, compared to 48% in favor. 
The officials said the vote results included Budapest, where support for the 
referendum was felt to be strong. 


However, referendum sponsors disputed the results, claiming that their count 
showed an opposite trend. "Frankly, we are surprised," referendum campaign 
director Tibor Vidos said. "The data we have is very different, going in the 
opposite direction." 


Official final results are not expected until Tuesday. But the early dispute 
over the results will likely add to the controversy surrounding the vote, which 
has turned into an electoral nightmare after originally being billed as the 
first free national ballot in the Soviet Bloc since 1945. 


Ironically, that 1945 vote also took place in Hungary, as one of the conditions 
of the Yalta agreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. In that 
vote, the Liberal-Democratic Small Holders Party won 57% of the vote, compared 
to only 17% for the Communist Party. As a result of the lopsided return against 
the Communist Party, no other free elections have been held in the Soviet Bloc 
until this year. 


Although incomplete, the count released by government election officials showed 
that at least enough Hungarian voters went to the polls Sunday to make the 
referendum binding. A major opposition party, the Democratic Forum, had asked 
voters to boycott the referendum. And many here feared that widespread 
confusion over the ballot issues would keep people away. 


The National Referendum, sponsored by the pro-Western Alliance of Free 
Democrats, asked voters to decide four issues, including the abolition of a 
notorious voluntary police unit, the Workers' Militia; a proposal to require 
the Communist Party, recently renamed the Hungarian Socialist Party, to reveal 
its financial assets, and another proposal banning Communist organizers from 
the workplace. According to the preliminary results, all of these issues were 
approved handily. 


However, vote tallies on the fourth and most controversial issue -- a proposal 
to delay the presidential elections until next spring, after the country's 
first multi-party parliamentary elections in four decades -- appeared much 
closer. 


Hungarian Socialist Party leaders opposed the measure. Instead, they want a 
presidential election to take place as scheduled in January, in hopes that 
longtime Communist Party member Pozsgay, leader of the party's reform wing, 
would be elected before the parliamentary elections. To help their cause, they 
managed to add a confusing "explanation" to the ballot -- opposed by the 
referendum sponsors -- that claimed a "no" vote ensured the "direct" election 
of the President. 


Until the vote Sunday, organizers were not even sure that 50% of the 7.8 
million registered voters, the minimum number required to make the election 
valid, would go to the polls. But Hungarian voters overcame a reputation for 
electoral apathy and flocked to the polling places. 


"We had reports from the countryside that many people went to the polls 
directly from church," said Vidos, leader of the alliance of four parties that 
sponsored the referendum.

HUNGARY'S PARLIAMENT: YES TO DEMOCRACY; 


EAST BLOC: A NEW REPUBLIC IS PROCLAIMED, THUS ENDING A 40-YEAR COMMUNIST 
DICTATORSHIP. 




From Times Wire Services 




BUDAPEST, Hungary 




In the glare of TV lights, Parliament on Wednesday adopted a series of 
constitutional amendments declaring Hungary a republic and marking the nation's 
dramatic return to a multi-party democracy. 


Deputies in a nationally televised session voted 333 to 5, with eight 
abstentions, to accept nearly 100 modifications to the 1949 constitution drawn 
up after the Communist takeover. 


The vote formally ends one-party domination in the East Bloc nation, which was 
officially renamed the Republic of Hungary. Like other East Bloc nations, it 
had defined itself as a people's republic in which all power belonged to the 
workers and the Communist Party was the leading force. 


Under the modified constitution, Hungary will become an independent, democratic 
and constitutional republic asserting "the values of both bourgeois democracy 
and democratic socialism," according to Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar. 


He said that the changes, affecting 90% of the old constitution, could be seen 
as creating a "transitional constitution" to change Hungary's political system. 


The new constitution not only sets the constitutional basis for the multi-party 
system but also codifies human and civil rights and separates the judiciary, 
executive and legislature. 


Hungary's first multi-party parliamentary elections since 1947 are due to take 
place by the middle of next year. 


Among the 94 modifications were amendments eliminating all references to the 
leading role of the recently dissolved Hungarian Socialist Workers' (Communist) 
Party. 


"Political parties may be freely established and may freely function," the 
amendment declared. 


An entirely new constitution is to be drawn up and adopted by the new 
Parliament after the national elections, but Justice Minister Kulcsar has said 
the amendments are necessary to make next year's elections legal. 


In addition, they abolish the 21-member collective presidential council headed 
by Bruno Straub, nominally head of state, which had broad powers, including 
acting for Parliament when it was not sitting, as well as overruling 
parliamentary decisions. In its place, a new post of president of the republic 
has been created. This role will be filled by Speaker of Parliament Matyas 
Szuros until a presidential election takes place, tentatively scheduled for 
Nov. 26. 


Szuros proclaimed Wednesday a historic day for Hungary. 


"A parliamentary democracy and a legal state is being built in Hungary on the 
ruins of a dictatorship of sorts," he told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug. 


Under the new amendments, the new president will be the commander in chief of 
the armed forces, is authorized to call national and regional elections, may 
initiate a referendum but may not be a leader of any political party. 


The president may dissolve Parliament if it fails to approve a new government 
or votes for no-confidence in the government four times in one year. 


A completely new constitution will be drafted by Parliament after the 
multi-party elections, which the must be held by next summer according to the 
amendments adopted Wednesday. 


However, the chamber stalled on one key move toward democracy, postponing a 
decision on opposition calls for a referendum on when to elect the head of 
state. Government leaders want the election next month, but opposition leaders 
say it's too soon. 


The voting came on the heels of another landmark decision -- the dissolution of 
the Communist Party and its replacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party, which 
has vowed commitment to a democratic system. 


Before the key votes, Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth called an emergency Cabinet 
meeting to discuss an opposition petition to postpone the election to the new 
state presidency until after next year's parliamentary elections. 


Some opposition parties say they have no time or resources to organize against 
Socialist Party candidate Imre Pozsgay. Banking on an overall opposition 
majority after next year's elections, they want the president to be appointed 
by the new Parliament.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 Feb (MTI) -- Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz on Friday set the date of the 1994 parliamentary elections 
in Hungary for Sunday, May 8. 
  Speaking to journalists in Parliament at a press conference 
broadcast by Hungarian Radio, the president said the second free 
elections would, perhaps, be even more important than the first, 
as they will prove the continuity of democracy. 
  Inasmuch as the second election in the switch to a civil 
democratic order will be clean and moderate, it will also 
provide a good report card on Hungarian democracy, Goncz said. 
  The president called on the country's population to ensure a 
significant turnout at the elections.

TURMOIL IN THE EAST BLOC; 


CROATIA COMMUNISTS CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS AS YUGOSLAV SPLITS WIDEN 




From Times Wire Services 




BELGRADE, Yugoslavia 




Political divisions in Yugoslavia widened Monday when the Communist Party in 
Croatia called for free multi-party elections next month and the leadership in 
Slovenia accused Serbia of aiming to break up the nation. 


Communists have been slow in realizing the "historic exhaustion of the 
single-party system," said Stanko Stojicevic, head of the Croatian Communist 
Party's ruling presidium. 


"There can be no democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the 
right of association and competition of political (movements) and programs," 
Stojicevic said. 


He was speaking in Zagreb at the start of a Croatian party congress where the 
policy-making Central Committee adopted a proposal that elections should be 
held in January instead of March for the republic's Parliament and should be 
wholly free. 


The proposal, which must be endorsed by the congress, put Croatia, Yugoslavia's 
second largest republic, squarely on the side of Slovenia, whose Communist 
Party has pledged to hold free elections next May for the Slovenian Parliament. 


It widened the breach between those two regions and Serbia, the largest of 
Yugoslavia's six republics, whose Communist leadership has explicitly ruled out 
a multi-party system and this month broke all economic relations with Slovenia. 


Responding to that move, Slovenian President Janez Stanovnik told his 
republic's Parliament: "The ultimate goal of these attacks is not just Slovenia 
and its leadership. They were just the first phase of a long-term strategy 
whose final phase is the liquidation of Yugoslavia." 


Slovenia, which borders Austria and Italy, fears that Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic wants to abolish the power-sharing arrangements between 
Yugoslavia's different nationalities and impose Serbian dominance over the 
nation. 


Croatia's move, which was accompanied by a call to abolish the constitutionally 
guaranteed leading political role of the Communist Party, mirrored the plunge 
into democracy that every Eastern European country except Romania has taken 
this year. 


Unlike the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia has been 
nonaligned since 1948. But like the others, the Yugoslav Communists had until 
this year claimed the exclusive right to rule and refused to allow free 
elections. 


"The present situation in the Communist Party can be changed only in conditions 
of political competition," Stojicevic said. "This is indispensable for the 
party's transformation into a modern political organization."

  [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) believes that the results of the first round 
of parliamentary elections held in Hungary on May 8 were greatly 
influenced by the operation of Hungarian Radio and Hungarian 
Television. ``The majority of the citizens receive their 
information from the electronic media, and it was here that the 
differences in the parties' manifestos could not be greatly 
elaborated. 
  "The new government must settle the situation of the media 
after the elections, and it must dismiss the vice-presidents of 
Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television, Laszlo Csucs and Gabor 
Nahlik, because they both worked in a manner contradictory to 
public service norms. New presidents and vice-presidents must 
be appointed to head Radio and Television, in order for them to 
consolidate the institutions." 
  The above was how SZDSZ executive Peter Hack evaluated the 
media situation in a meeting with the press in Budapest on 
Wednesday [11 May], prior to holding a discussion with Dutch 
students studying the media. 
  According to Hack, there are good reasons for Dutch students 
to gather information in Hungary, as the media situation in the 
country can be instructive, similar to the often mentioned 
"veterinarian horse". 
  The SZDSZ politician said the new Parliament must enact the 
media law by October at the latest. The law should create the 
conditions for commercial radio and television so that open 
bidding can take place early next year. 
  The Free Democrats believe the state should keep an 
earth-based television channel and a satellite channel, while 
two earth-based channels could be privatized for 10 to 15 years, 
based on a concession tender. The SZDSZ believes it justified 
to have two public service radio channels: Kossuth station and 
the cultural station Bartok, with private radios broadcasting on 
the other frequencies.

 [Editorial by Peter Csermely: "Both Fewer and Broken"] 
  [Text] At the time of writing, we still have no final data 
on the exact election results. Therefore, what I am writing now 
is only valid if the quick summaries presented to us on Sunday 
evening at least slightly reflect the future official results. 
Thus, let us stay in the realm of supposition -- namely that the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has achieved a landslide 
victory. 
  Starting from this premise, and also avoiding any special 
pathetic formulation, let me say quite dryly that we cannot find 
an independently chosen step backward of similar proportions in 
Hungarian history. By electing the MSZP, the Hungarian 
population has proven that they do not deserve freedom. They do 
not know what to do with it; or if they do, this is the result. 
The coalition has not brought a Canaan to Hungary in four years 
and, therefore, it fell due to something that it often mentioned 
as inevitable -- namely that the first steps of restructuring 
will be a burden to everyone. Our society did not understand 
that dealing with the debt inherited from those who are now 
delighted in mischief was not an empty slogan, that it is 
impossible to extricate the country in one or two years from 40 
years of mud, and that the long debates in Parliament, which 
everyone was fed up with in the end, are natural things in a 
democracy and not something that proves the inadequacy of the 
legislators. No: Hungary's citizens turned away from genuine 
politics and gave up the luxury of thinking, and they voted in a 
way in which it appeared to them in some of their sober moments, 
namely that things were better then. The MSZP deserves to 
celebrate. Their deputies not only return but are brought back 
on the shoulders of the dissatisfied masses. We do not need 
Europe, and we spit on 1956; if one is a former policeman, so be 
it. Hungary voluntarily returned to the feet of its former 
masters. 
  This gesture shows an immeasurable moral distortion: From 
its own will, our society absolved the socialists from their 
moral burden of destroying this country. There are responsible 
people and victims of this act. And there are people who are 
both responsible and victims: the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF]. The MDF is a victim because it was unable to get closer 
to the society in four years; it is also a victim because the 
dream of Western European integration and NATO membership proved 
to be at an unattainable distance; the MDF is a victim because 
the coalition engaged in politics on a moral basis and failed; 
it is a victim because it counted on the people's common sense 
and, disregarding the mass media, it tried to influence the 
people in a weak election campaign. I do not want to write all 
this in detail again, although I should do so because the MDF is 
also responsible for all of this. 
  The overwhelming majority of deputies in Hungary's second 
freely elected Parliament will be communists. One does not yet 
know much about the strategy of the old-new masters, but one can 
presume that they will maintain the playful formalities of 
democracy. For example, there will be other parties there: an 
MDF that will succumb to the defeat and rapidly disintegrate 
from within; the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], a party 
forced to continue on a wild goose chase for another four years, 
at least; the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a 
party unable to break out of mediocrity; the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP], a party that so often used the 
anti-communist rhetoric, with which it discredited both this 
rhetoric and itself; and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], 
a party that, well, always falls on its feet. There will also 
be a free press: It will not be able to cause half as much 
damage as it has already caused. In view of the statements made 
in the last four years, there will be no unemployment, price 
increases, strikes, inflation, privatization, national 
minorities living beyond our borders; and the Hungarian soccer 
will flourish again. This is only natural; this is why we 
reelected them. 
  Three out of the four Visegrad countries have collapsed. The 
Czech Republic no longer has an opponent in the race to catch up 
with Europe. It is true that capital -- or, using the old-new 
terminology, the robbing imperialist capital -- will continue to 
trickle for a while, then it will stop. We will then take up 
loans -- some 22 billion, for example. And before the House 
collapses on our heads, we will again hand over the government 
helm and the bills to others; there will always be honest and 
romantic people. Then we will again be able to relax for four 
years while they play democracy. What problems could we have? 
  In its often-mentioned former electoral slogan, the MDF 
promised a thorough cleanup. This has failed to materialize 
ever since. We will get it now for sure.

  [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] condemns the 
bombing carried out at the parliament building at dawn today. 
The MDF believes that there is no significant political force 
in Hungary today that would have an interest in creating 
confusion or disturbing the country's peace and order, the party 
communique stresses. The attempt could only have been carried 
out by an extremist individual or group, who or which cannot 
accept that the Hungarian nation, in free elections that were 
held for a second time, has decided in favor of multiparty 
parliamentary democracy.

 ["G.H."-initialed report: "Domestic Stability, Incalculable 
Factors in Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 2 March -- In reply to a question about 
whether he will still be head of the government after the May 
parliamentary elections, Hungarian Prime Minister Boross said 
that he looked ahead to June with "moderate or cheerful 
optimism." "These will be the second free elections, it will be 
possible to make more accurate predictions when the fourth 
elections take place. However, the latest data indicates that 
an important part of the population understands our efforts and 
recognizes what we have done within the country and in bringing 
Hungary closer to Europe," said Boross, the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum's leading candidate, confidently. He ruled out coalitions 
with the Socialist Party, the Alliance of Free Democrats under 
its present leadership, the "Hungarian Life and Justice Party," 
and the "Independent Smallholders Party. Boross has thus made 
it clear that he does not want to have anything to do 
politically with the right-wing extremists Csurka and Torgyan, 
who lead the last two of the above parties and were formerly 
politicians in the current coalition government: "Their 
rhetoric and mentality is not compatible with the center-right 
direction that we consider acceptable, also acceptable from the 
viewpoint of the interests of our European efforts." 
  Speaking to this newspaper, the Hungarian prime minister 
also 
noted that Hungary was "potentially in a very dangerous 
geopolitical position." Five new states had been created on its 
borders, war is being waged in Hungary's vicinity, and there is 
a possibility that there might be another wave of refugees. 
That makes the domestic stability that the government has 
achieved all the more noteworthy. So, what is the significance 
of the skinheads, who have also created much commotion in 
Hungary? "In the past, skinheads were a relatively infrequent 
phenomenon in our country, and now there are only isolated 
incidents. However, we must implement one or two measures to 
dissolve these childish gangs. In Hungary, the phenomenon plays 
a smaller role than in most Europe states." 
  Regarding the emergence of extreme right-wing groupings that 
draw on the legacy of Arrow Cross leader Szalasi, who formed a 
Quisling regime in 1944 during the German occupation, the prime 
minister said: "If the supporters are very old people, then I 
feel sorry for them, if they are young people, then I cannot 
understand them. Szalasi was a traitor to the fatherland and has 
no place in Hungarian history." Recently, a man returned to 
Hungary from abroad and formed a group with a good 30 members. 
"Currently, the prosecution service is dealing with them; they 
are more of an irritation than a danger. There is nothing to 
indicate that they are spreading to the provinces." This kind 
of extremism has no support in Hungary and there is also no real 
left-wing danger. 
  Is Hungary, disappointed about the distance that the West is 
maintaining -- the "Partnership for Peace" instead of membership 
of MATO, associate membership of the European Union rather than 
full membership? "Hungary has really been regularly 
disappointed by the West since 1526. This stems from its 
difficult position and in part from its realistic and in part 
unrealistic expectations," conceded Boross. In 1989, in view of 
the opening up of borders and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact 
(which Hungary initiated), Hungary had great expectations, but 
two years later, one had to recognize reality "especially, that 
moving closer to the economic and security alliances, to that 
which offers real security, requires time." 
  The Hungarian head of government attracted international 
attention when, shortly after the announcement of the NATO 
ultimatum to end the siege of Sarajevo, he said that should the 
sanction be applied, then Hungarian airspace would not be 
available for AWACs flights. The background to that statement, 
which could be viewed as a political mistake and as indicating a 
new direction in Hungarian security in view of NATO's 
disappointing overall conduct and Russia's involvement in the 
former Yugoslavia, was explained by Boross as follows: "Hungary 
is a neighbor of Yugoslavia (he constantly used that term for 
the Belgrade republic) and one can expect to remain so for 
hundreds of years. There are 500,000 Hungarians living on the 
territory of Yugoslavia and they live in a region where there is 
no international control. In addition, Hungary is interested in 
the Danube shipping route, the 'Adria' oil pipeline, and, not 
least, in putting at ease the Hungarians in Vojvodina, of whom 
100,000 have already left their homes." He added that Hungary 
was not a member of NATO "and thus had no clear guarantees for 
its security, even if it were to receive such guarantees under 
certain circumstances in a conflict situation." The government 
is seeking to ensure its security and the interests of the 
Hungarian minority by maintaining good-neighborly relations, 
including contacts between military leaderships. This has led 
to the Hungarian stance of strictly adhering to the UN and UN 
Security Council resolutions and participating in the 
implementation of the embargo and the ban on flights. "However, 
the direct bombardment of ground targets does worry us." In 
connection with Boross' 1-day visit to Bonn, Hungarian diplomats 
said that the Hungarian Government was bound by a parliamentary 
resolution that only permits the use of Hungarian airspace for 
overseeing airspace and nothing else. 
  Russia's involvement in a region that it was forced out of 
by 
Tito in 1948 has also affected Hungary. There is power vacuum 
in the region and that whets appetites. The head of the 
Hungarian Government stated that Hungary, which is smaller than 
Bavaria, wants to convince Russia that dynamic relations and 
extensive commerce are advantageous (Hungary exports goods worth 
over $3 billion to Russia) and that Moscow can have no interests 
that are directed against Hungary. It is not the first time in 
Hungary's history that the country has clearly oriented itself 
to the West, while, at the same time, negotiating with all 
influential powers. In a speech delivered at the headquarters 
of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Boross said: "We want 
security as quickly as possible, at the present time we, miss 
it."

    Solcanu Salutes `Free Elections' in Moldova

  [Text] A rapid development of political events can 
presently be seen both at home and abroad, in our close 
vicinity, said Ioan Solcanu, deputy chairman of Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR], during a news conference held today. 
  We salute the first free multiparty elections held [on 27 
February] in the Republic of Moldova, which, according to 
observers, were organized under optimal circumstances, despite 
certain minor incidents. We hope that the new framework will 
allow for the assertion, without any obstructions, of the 
democratic principles, and that also includes telling the truth 
about the history of the [Moldova] territory and native 
population. 
  During the news conference Solcanu also referred to the 
talks 
held by PDSR with PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party] and 
PD-FSN [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]. During the 
talks held with PUNR the two parties found that in the current 
political context the protocol signed [on 1 February] remains 
valid, although it cannot be implemented literally, but merely 
in its spirit. Talking about the consultations with PD-FSN, 
Solcanu assessed that a step forward has been made, as they 
reviewed the goals pursued by the two political parties in the 
current dialogue. That is important because PDSR is involved in 
talks with other parties as well, including parties belonging to 
the Democratic Convention of Romania and those of the current 
parliamentary coalition. Solcanu stressed that they discussed 
aspects of a possible moratorium between PDSR and PD-FSN, which 
could contribute to the continuation of the dialogue between the 
two parties, ease the current strain in the political life, and 
offer elements needed for a possible future cooperation in 
parliament. 
  All political parties have to act with responsibility and 
make efforts to find the convergent points to surmount the 
current situation, concluded Solcanu.

REBELS REJECT PLAN FOR FREE ELECTIONS 




From Times staff and Wire reports 




The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group rejected a 12-point Vietnamese proposal for 
free elections in Cambodia, saying it was simply meant to preserve the 
Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh. Hanoi's proposal, put forward in 
talks with the United States earlier this month, is supposed to guarantee free 
and fair elections as the key to ending more than 11 years of conflict in 
Cambodia. But the essence of the proposal calls for elections to be held under 
the existing government, thereby allowing Vietnam to control the process.

Hungarian liberals yesterday began an uphill battle to stop the former
communists translating their victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections
into a landslide in the second and decisive round of voting on May 29.
With 32.5 per cent of the vote, the Hungarian Socialist party, the successor
to the communist regime, won 55 seats, took the lead in a further 158 and
came within reach of an outright majority in Hungary's 386-seat parliament.
The Hungarian elections establish as a firm trend the resurgence of former
communists in the region on a tide of public disillusionment with the pain
of economic transition. Socialists are back in power in Poland and Lithuania
and only in the Czech Republic have the ruling conservatives maintained
their popularity.
The Socialist surge came at the expense of the governing conservatives.
Voters, bitter at the decline in their living standards, gave the Hungarian
Democratic Forum only 12 per cent of the vote. But the liberal Alliance of
Free Democrats, whose 19.4 per cent of the vote put it in second place,
called on voters yesterday to switch to it in the run-off election later
this month to avert a Socialist political monopoly.
A Free Democrat comeback would deny the Socialists an outright majority and
make the most likely outcome of the election a coalition between the two
parties. As in Poland, the Hungarian ex-communists may offer the premiership
to the leader of their smaller coalition partner, the Free Democrats', Mr
Gabor Kuncze.
Hungary's stock market had discounted a strong Socialist showing in the
elections but the prospect of an outright majority for the former communists
caused consternation. Only one transaction took place in the first 45
minutes of trading yesterday. But when activity did begin there were few
price movements and the BSE index closed down just 1.56 on 1619.22.
Compensation coupons, the vouchers issued by the conservative government to
owners of property confiscated by the former communist regime, fell to an
all-time low of 49.5 per cent before recovering slightly.
These special securities can be used to buy state property, and while the
Socialists have said they will continue with this privatisation programme,
the market doubts they will be as generous as the current government in
offering state companies for coupons.
A public offering for compensation coupons of shares in Danubius Hotels, one
of Hungary's three large hotel chains, was massively oversubscribed as
investors sought to reduce their holdings of the securities.
Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the former and likely future Socialist finance minister,
also said in an interview that he would immediately halt the small
shareholder programme, a Hungarian variant of mass privatisation which
allows small investors to pay for public issues on an instalment basis.
But Mr Bekesi, who represents the strong technocratic wing of the party,
reaffirmed the Socialists' overall commitment to privatisation. He indeed
suggested he would open the economy further to foreign investors, who have
already injected more than Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) into Hungary in the
last five years.

HUNGARY TO HOLD FIRST FREE ELECTION IN 40 YEARS TODAY 




By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




BALASSAGYARMAT, Hungary 




For Marta Osztroluczki and the Independent Smallholders Party she hopes to 
represent in Parliament, the surest road to recovery from the ravages of 
socialism is to turn back the clock on more than 40 years. 


"Not much of the past 40 years is worth saving," insists Osztroluczki, a 
26-year-old geography teacher, wife and mother of two from this northern 
farming town on the border with Czechoslovakia. "Everything we learned was 
designed to keep the Communist Party in power. That is no longer what anyone 
wants." 


Hungarians must be brave enough to admit the failure of their recent history, 
the ardent advocate of agrarian reform contended at a district rally winding up 
her campaign for today's national election, Hungary's first free ballot in more 
than four decades. To move forward, she argued, the nation must first move 
back. 


The Smallholders propose to redistribute land and assets according to 1947 
ownership records, a move viewed by liberals and city dwellers as naive, 
illogical and as potentially disruptive as the forced collectivizations it aims 
to reverse. 


But in rural farming regions like Balassagyarmat, a longing to return to 
Hungary's simple agrarian heritage has combined with a nationwide fever of 
anti-socialism to make the Smallholders plan an appealing alternative to the 
economic doomsaying of the two other leading political parties. 


The center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum and the liberal Alliance of Free 
Democrats have warned voters of hard times ahead as the nation wrestles with a 
$20-billion foreign debt and a painful conversion to capitalism that may cause 
inflation and unemployment to soar. 


"Some of the population doesn't want to go back to farming, but we must do it 
for the good of the nation," contends Gyorgy Balogh, vice president of the 
Smallholders in Budapest. "It is impossible to solve the problem in any other 
way. We must begin at the last turning point, in 1947." 


About half of Hungary's territory was parceled out to farmers under the 1947 
agrarian reform, which the Smallholders contend is the only equitable basis for 
redistributing assets. 


They propose returning the land to its former owners or their legitimate heirs 
within two years and following up with a second stage of the private property 
reform that would restore ownership of shops, homes and other assets to the 
titleholders of 1947. 


The two leading parties, each of which has been drawing about 20% of voter 
support in public opinion polls, dismiss the Shareholders' redistribution plan 
as unworkable. 


Miklos Haraszti, a Budapest candidate for the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
protests that 40% of those eligible to lay claim to their families' former 
farmland now live in cities and work at industrial jobs. To hand over those 
property rights would send food prices skyrocketing, Haraszti argues, as 
collective farmers would have to rent land at market prices from the new owners 
or face eviction and unemployment. 


Yet the prospect for a swift transition to private ownership or cashing in on 
sale of the acreage are making the Smallholders' policy attractive to enough 
Hungarians to be worrisome for the more mainstream parties. 


The Smallholders trail the Forum and the Alliance by only a few percentage 
points in polls that some fear have failed to canvass voters in the provinces, 
where Smallholders support is based. 


Pollsters attempting to chart the mood of the electorate have been thwarted by 
the inadequate communications network in Hungary, where only one in 10 
households has a telephone and the media have yet to shed the prejudice of more 
than 40 years of one-party control. 


The Smallholders' potential to emerge as the dark horse has kept the door open 
for partnership in the likely event that no party wins a majority in the 
complicated balloting. 


Hungarians will have the opportunity to vote for both a specific candidate to 
represent their home district and for the party that most appeals to them. 


The winner in each of the 176 individual constituencies will be the first 
candidate to get an absolute majority, with runoffs tentatively set for April 8 
for those districts where no candidate clears 50% in the first vote. Another 
152 seats will be determined by each party's standing in the popularity vote, 
and the remaining 58 seats in the 386-member Parliament will be distributed 
proportionally among the parties winning at least 4% of the aggregate vote. 


All 28 parties running national campaigns wound up their stumping Friday to 
give voters pause for contemplation before the polls open today at 6 a.m. 


Geza Jeszenszky, a foreign policy expert with the Hungarian Democratic Forum, 
predicted at least a 70% turnout, despite what Westerners see as a relatively 
apathetic attitude among the nation's 7.5 million eligible voters. 


The three leading parties are united in their prediction that whichever force 
comes out ahead will have to form a coalition with at least one of the other 
two to push its reform policies through Parliament.

Former communists continued their comeback in eastern Europe yesterday,
taking a commanding lead in the first round of Hungary's parliamentary
elections.
With nearly all the votes counted, the Hungarian Socialist party (MSZP) had
33 per cent. This was three times its tally in 1990 when the electorate
delivered its verdict on four decades of communist dictatorship.
The left relegated the ruling right-wing Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) to
a humiliating third place with just 12 per cent of the vote, as Hungarians
punished the government for the one-fifth decline in GDP since the collapse
of communism.
But the third force in Hungarian politics, the liberal Alliance of Free
Democrats (SZDSZ), benefited from a surprising last-minute surge and took 20
per cent of the vote.
The Hungarian elections establish as a firm trend the resurgence of former
communists on a tide of public disillusionment with the pain of economic
transition. Socialists are back in power in Poland and Lithuania, and only
in the Czech Republic have the ruling conservatives maintained their
popularity.
Foreign investors and the stock market reacted calmly, expecting Socialist
technocrats to continue or even accelerate economic reform. The party's
domestic opponents warn, however, that the Socialists will also come under
pressure to meet their supporters' expectations of an immediate improvement
in living standards and employment.
'Maybe we have reason to be happy, but we should not be too confident
because it will be difficult to govern,' said Mr Laszlo Bekesi, a former
Socialist finance minister likely to hold the same portfolio in the new
government.
The liberal revival may be sufficient to force the Socialists to look for
partners to form a government. The Free Democrats, their preferred allies,
say they would insist that a coalition follow the liberals' tough economic
programme.
Surprisingly, Socialist technocrats admit they would welcome the opportunity
to share responsibility for painful economic measures. As in Poland, the
Hungarian ex-communists may offer the premiership to the leader of their
coalition partner, the Free Democrats' Mr Gabor Kuncze.
The composition of parliament, in which six parties are expected to win
seats, will only be decided after the second round of voting on May 29.
Extrapolating from yesterday's trends, the Socialists would emerge with more
than 200 of the 386 seats in parliament. About 60 seats would go to the Free
Democrats and the MDF would get 30. But the liberals believe it has narrowed
to a two-party race and suggest that fear of an ex-communist landslide will
draw voters to them, denying the Socialists an outright majority.
