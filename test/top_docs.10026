Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley has won his fight for locating a third
international airport inside the boundaries of the city. The airport site,
on Chicago's south-east side, will cost Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 6.1bn) to
develop, Barbara Durr reports from Chicago. The project, the biggest public
works bonanza in Chicago for decades, is expected to generate over 200,000
jobs.
The site gained the crucial support of Illinois governor Mr Jim Edgar after
the mayor agreed to set up a regional authority to control all three Chicago
airports.

portfolio in the early 1980s. A loss-maker at the time, the credit card
division is now one of the bank's biggest profit centres.
Before joining First Chicago, Mullin spent nine years at McKinsey, where he
helped forge Conrail out of a handful of failed eastern freight carriers.
Mullin claims he fully understands the bank's balance of business. 'My job
is to develop a strategy for the entire corporation,' he says. 'We have as
much upside in corporate banking as anywhere else.'
Still, he is keen to keep First Chicago a leader in its home market. Barely
a week after his promotion, First Chicago announced it would acquire Lake
Shore Bancorp, a local institution with Dollars 1.2bn in assets and
headquarters on Chicago's posh Michigan Avenue for Dollars 323m in stock.
First Chicago's share price fell after the deal, which analysts viewed as
pricy. However, Mullin says the purchase makes strategic sense and that
First Chicago should grow aggressively in all its divisions.

THE SIDELINES; 


HAWKS-BULLS PROD ILLINOIS ON ARENA 




From Times wire services 




CHICAGO 




The owners of the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls plan to blitz the 
Illinois General Assembly this week for help in building a hockey-basketball 
palace on Chicago's West Side. 


William Wirtz and Jerry Reinsdorf wanted to make their case three weeks ago, 
but were held up by Mayor Richard M. Daley, who wanted assurances that 70 
families to be displaced by the new arena would be adequately compensated, The 
Chicago Tribune reported today. 


The $110-million arena would seat 22,000 people and accommodate 7,000 cars on a 
lot directly south of the current Chicago Stadium. Wirtz and Reinsdorf are 
seeking a state subsidy to build the arena, the Tribune said. Unlike the new 
White Sox stadium on Chicago's South Side, the Hawks-Bulls arena would be 
privately financed.

ILLINOIS Governor Jim Edgar has outlined a plan to locate a third
international airport in the Chicago area near rural Peotone, disregarding
criticism that it would be too far away and would not draw airlines or
passengers, AP reports from Chicago.
The Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) plan includes proposals to build an
additional runway to relieve congestion at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport and create a Dollars 423m high-speed rail system linking down-town
Chicago to the proposed new airport about 35 miles away.
The airport would create 102,000 construction jobs and 167,000 permanent
jobs by 2020, Mr Edgar said.
The Illinois Senate turned down an earlier proposal for a Dollars 10.8bn
airport, for which Chicago Mayor Richard Daley fought for three years.

In an ambitious attempt to export American management education to Europe
which will be watched keenly by its rivals, the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business will launch an executive MBA programme in
Barcelona in July.
The course will consist of ten sessions held over 18 months, adding up to 14
weeks of intensive work. Taught in English by members of the regular faculty
of the Chicago business school, it will be aimed at high fliers with about
10 years of business experience.
The Chicago school claims this is the first time an executive level
programme, leading to an MBA degree, has been offered in Europe by a leading
American institution.
However, the precedent of Harvard - which once considered offering a
shortened version of its Advance Management Programme in Switzerland - is
seen by some as salutary. Chicago appears to have spent a lot of time and
effort wooing European companies, but it is bound to be a hard sell in the
current economic climate and at a time when European schools are becoming
more international.
Robin Hogarth, Chicago's deputy dean, said recruitment is 'going well',
though he was reluctant to talk numbers. 'I doubt if we'll be up to 80 (the
maximum) this time'. He rejects the Harvard parallel, stressing that Chicago
'is in this for the long term' and 'invented the executive MBA concept in
the US 50 years ago'.
Chicago courses in Barcelona will be taught in a newly renovated building
with state-of-the-art facilities provided with the aid of Argentaria, a
large Spanish financial services company.
European participants will travel to Chicago in the second year to take
courses with their American counterparts. Similarly, Americans following the
executive MBA in Chicago will travel to Spain.

THE closure of the catalogue and the 50,000 new layoffs at Sears nationwide
is expected to cause barely a ripple in the economy of the Big Store's home
town, Chicago. 'It's kind of an irony,' said Ms Diane Swonk, regional
economist at First Chicago. 'If this had to happen it's better to have
happened in Chicago than in New York or Los Angeles.' Metropolitan Chicago
has weathered the recession better than those cities, she said. Other
retailers are entering the Chicago market and should absorb the estimated
4,500 area employees the restructuring will make jobless. The
Dayton-Hudson-owned discount chain, Target, plans to open stores, while
electronics retailer Best Buy and Texas-based Nordstroms are also expanding.

THE Midwest stock exchange, the second-largest stock exchange in the US
after New York, will return to its original name, the Chicago Stock
Exchange, from July 8. Members voted for the change in the hope that the
Chicago name would carry a higher profile than 'Midwest'.
The 111-year-old stock exchange took the Midwest name in 1949 when it
acquired stock exchanges in Cleveland, St Louis, Minneapolis and, later, New
Orleans.
'We operate in a very competitive environment and want to build the identity
of our exchange locally, nationally and internationally,' said Mr Homer
Livingston, exchange president. 'We believe the name 'Chicago' is key to
strengthening that identity, given the Chicago exchange's reputation for
creative products, innovative technology and focus on service.'

A FLOOD in Chicago's underground tunnel system yesterday plunged the city
into chaos.
Trading was halted at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the world's two largest futures markets, and thousands of office
workers and hotel guests were evacuated.
Flooding began at about 6:30am after the rupture of a passageway in the
city's 93-year-old underground tunnel system. Although not officially
confirmed, it is believed a construction crew working near the Kinzie Street
bridge over the Chicago River accidentally punctured the wall while sinking
pilings.
Water poured into the underground tunnel system, originally built for coal
delivery and rubbish removal but now mainly used for freight and
telecommunications cables. A third of the downtown area, known as the Loop,
lost electricity in the early morning and further cuts were expected. No
injuries were reported.
The mass transit system was paralysed downtown and the city hall was
flooded.
By mid-day, despite pumping, the water level was still rising. Emergency
crews struggled to slow the water flow into the tunnels and plug the hole.
The Army Corps of Engineers was working to lower the level of the Chicago
River, which flows through the centre of the city, by closing a series of
locks connecting the river and Lake Michigan.
Although the futures exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the
largest US options market, and other businesses hoped to reopen this
morning, by late yesterday afternoon it remained unclear how soon the
tunnels could be cleared.

CHICAGO GALLERY TO SELL 11 WORKS TO BUY BRANCUSI 




By United Press International 




CHICAGO 




The Art Institute of Chicago is putting 11 works on the auction block, 
including paintings by Monet, Picasso, Modigliani, Utrillo and Degas, to raise 
the $12-million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, "Golden Bird," by 
Constantin Brancusi. 


The Art Institute, which in the past has resisted selling works to purchase 
others, is making an exception in this case, the Chicago Sun-Times reported 
today. 


"To let the Brancusi leave is unthinkable," Director James N. Wood said. "The 
work is seminal to Chicago's reputation as a center for modern art." 


The Brancusi is owned by the Art Club of Chicago, which is selling it to buy a 
new gallery for its other works. Wood said the Art Institute already has 
possession of the sculpture and is committed to paying $8 million by the end of 
June and $4 million more over the next 10 years.

A weather front meteorologists were calling the 'Siberian Express' gripped
the upper Midwest for the sixth consecutive day yesterday, with extreme cold
closing businesses and schools and snarling airline traffic, reports Laurie
Morse from Chicago. At Chicago's O'Hare airport, the busiest in the US, many
flights have been cancelled since Monday. Snow was still hampering attempts
to normalise services.
The spell is breaking records. Temperatures in Chicago have not reached
above zero for a week, with the mercury dipping to 21 degrees below zero
yesterday. In northern regions of the midwest, temperatures fell as low as
60 degrees below zero.

THE Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's
two largest futures markets, begin tests today on a hand-held electronic
trading card, reports Barbara Durr in Chicago.
The two exchanges have spent some Dollars 6m developing Audit, which
promises to help resolve many of the regulatory issues of trading fraud. It
will replace the time-honoured practice of scribbling on paper cards and
create a tamper-proof trail for each trade.
Traders are known to have mixed feelings about the electronic trading device
partly because they fear they will not be able to work as quickly in fast
moving markets.
Although testing was due to begin last year, development delays forced a
postponement. The first prototype, a touchscreen model from Spectrix, will
be tried in the wheat pit of the CBOT and the D-Mark pit of the CME.

From Times Staff and Wire Reports 




SEC Probing First Chicago Statements: The Securities and Exchange Commission 
has begun an inquiry into allegations that First Chicago Corp. leaked certain 
sensitive information to securities analysts in advance of a public 
announcement projecting lower first-quarter earnings. 


Some analysts said the probe has the potential to change the landscape of their 
profession. The SEC declined to comment on the inquiry. The analysts worry that 
allegations that First Chicago improperly disclosed an impending increase in 
non-performing loans could freeze the information flow that is their lifeblood. 
They said what they learned from First Chicago was the routine information that 
their profession relies on.

BRIND'AMOUR HELPS BLUES GET THE JUMP ON BLACKHAWKS, 4-3 




By Associated Press 




CHICAGO 




Rookie Rod Brind'Amour scored two goals and Rick Meagher and Brett Hull one 
each Wednesday night, leading the St. Louis Blues to a 4-3 victory over the 
Chicago Blackhawks in the opening game of their second-round playoff series. 


The victory took away the home-ice advantage for Chicago, which finished first 
in the Norris Division. 


The Blues grabbed a 4-1 lead midway in the second period before the Blackhawks 
staged a comeback that fell short after goalie Greg Millen was replaced by Ed 
Belfour. 


Chicago put on the pressure in the final period but couldn't offset the tight 
checking of the Blues. With 42 seconds remaining, the Blackhawks pulled Belfour 
for a sixth attacker, but were stopped cold by goalie Vincent Riendeau. 


Riendeau was playing in place of Curtis Joseph, who suffered a shoulder injury 
in the final game of the Toronto series and is expected to miss two games. 


The Blues held a 5-2-1 edge over the Blackhawks and were 3-1 at Chicago during 
the regular season.

THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to extend the time its products are
traded on Globex, the electronic futures and options trading system operated
by Reuters and Chicago's two futures exchanges, writes Laurie Morse in
Chicago.
The longer hours, which take effect on November 1, will eliminate a
late-afternoon pause and bring the system closer to its intended 24-hour
global operation. CME currency and interest rate products will trade
continuously on Globex from early afternoon through to 6am next morning. The
Chicago Board of Trade is not taking part in the move towards 'seamless'
trading.

Chicago's O'Hare Airport served 66m passengers in 1993, making it one of the
world's largest, and often among the most frustrating, transit points for
business travellers. Local politics have constrained badly-needed runway
expansion at O'Hare, resulting in air traffic congestion and flight delays.
The congestion extends to the highways that surround the airport. Interstate
94, the main artery between O'Hare and downtown Chicago, is under
construction throughout this summer, with the project planned to extend into
1995. Ground transportation delays are expected to peak during the weekends
preceding the May 30 and July 4 US holidays, and between June 14 and July 2,
when more than 60,000 foreign visitors will come to Chicago for the World
Cup soccer tournament.
Airport officials encourage travellers to use Chicago's train system to get
into the city, since traffic gridlock can turn a 40-minute taxi or rental
car ride into a two-hour ordeal at peak times. Chicago Transit Authority
trains can be caught right at the airport, and deliver passengers to the
central business district, the Chicago 'loop', in about 40 minutes for a
fare of Dollars 1.50. Taxi fares to the city run to about Dollars 30.
The CTA trains offer the noisy, untidy jolting of a carnival ride, and have
no provision for luggage. However, they provide unexpected views of
Chicago's mean streets, multi-ethnic neighborhoods, and some of the best
graffiti art in the US. Train travel is only recommended during daylight
hours, with cab or limousine service available after dark.
Last May a new Dollars 618m International Terminal (terminal 5) opened at
O'Hare. This bright facility offers a buffet of Chicago fast-food
specialties, including Chicago-style frankfurters and pizza. There is a
6,000 sq ft duty-free shop; one of the largest in the US; and information
booths with friendly multi-lingual attendants on both terminal levels.
But travellers should note that the international terminal is located away
from the main airport, and that connections can be made only by taking a
five-minute trip on the new Dollars 127m airport transit train.
While major international carriers are now using the new terminal, US
airlines that make international flights are still operating out of their
own terminals. International travellers departing from O'Hare should check
with their airlines for departure location.
O'Hare's largest concentration of business services is in Terminal 3 near
the American Airlines gates. It is equipped with 17 conference rooms with
video conferencing capabilities, all available for short or long-term
rental.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; 


BLACKHAWKS WIN, WILL MEET FLAMES IN CAMPBELL FINALS 




By AP 




ST. LOUIS 




Bob Murray and Wayne Presley scored eight seconds apart to key a three-goal 
burst in the second period Wednesday night as the Chicago Blackhawks won the 
Norris Division playoff championship with a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis 
Blues. 


Chicago, outscored, 27-17, by St. Louis in eight regular-season games, won the 
best-of-seven series in five games, winning the last three games. 


Dave Manson had two assists for the Blackhawks, who had the lowest point total 
of the 16 playoff teams. Chicago will open the Campbell Conference finals 
against the Calgary Flames next week. 


Chicago, trailing 1-0, received the break it needed when Blue defenseman Glen 
Featherstone received a major penalty and game misconduct for an altercation 
with Chicago's Jeremy Roenick. 


The teams were both a player short when Murray took Manson's pass from inside 
the Chicago zone and skated in alone on St. Louis goalie Greg Millen. Eight 
seconds later, Presley scored with 10:35 to play in the second period after 
Blackhawk captain Dirk Graham stole the puck in the St. Louis zone. 


Roenick capped Chicago's three-goal spree with St. Louis a man short because of 
Featherstone's penalty, shooting off the right boards between Millen's skates 
with Blue defenseman Tom Tilley serving as a screen. 


Roenick's goal, his first of the playoffs, increased the Blackhawks' lead to 
3-1 with 7:47 to play. Tilley scored with 17:28 left on a 50-foot shot, but 
Steve Thomas scored on a breakaway for Chicago with 11:37 left.

BARENBOIM CONFIRMED FOR CHICAGO PODIUM 




Daniel Barenboim, the 46-year-old conductor/pianist fired from Opera de la 
Bastille in Paris two weeks ago, has been named the next music director of the 
Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Barenboim, who will immediately assume the title of 
music director designate, takes up the directorship for the 1991-92 season. 


Sir Georg Solti, the highly acclaimed music director of the Chicago Symphony 
for the past 20 seasons, will become music director laureate. Solti, 76, told 
orchestra officials in 1986 that he wished to step down after the orchestra's 
1990-91 centennial season, according to the orchestra's announcement. Barenboim 
almost immediately became the rumored front-runner for the position, but 
official announcement of it was delayed because of Solti's desire not to spend 
too many years as a lame-duck director with a publicly named successor. 


"This is the most difficult decision of my life . . . I was in tears," Solti 
said Monday at a press conference in Chicago. "Still, it is the only right 
thing to do. You must not stay too long." 


Barenboim is no stranger to the Chicago Symphony. He first conducted it in 
1970, and has made more than 30 recordings with the orchestra, including the 
Bruckner and Schumann symphony cycles. He comes to the CSO from 13 years as 
music director of L'Orchestre de Paris, another position where he succeeded 
Solti. 


"I have known him (Barenboim) and have been closely involved in his development 
as a conductor for many years, and he is my first choice," Solti said in the 
Chicago announcement. 


Solti has also supported Barenboim in his dispute with Pierre Berge, who fired 
the conductor from the new Opera Bastille, scheduled to open on the 200th 
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14. Solti was one of the 
world-class musicians signing a petition to Culture Minister Jack Lang, 
suggesting they might cancel their performances with the company. 


Among the issues in the affair are Berge's charges that Barenboim was paid too 
much, and was turning opera-for-Everyman into a high-priced, elitist endeavor. 


The conductor may become open to similar controversy in Chicago. According to 
published reports of his response to the appointment, Barenboim said: "If it 
doesn't sound too arrogant, I really would like to take culture out of the 
entertainment world in Chicago. It has all the conditions for being a great 
cultural center." 


Barenboim's Paris wages were $1.1 million. Chicago officials have declined to 
specify what he will earn on his three-year contract.
