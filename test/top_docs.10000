E. GERMANY OPENS BORDERS; 


CITIZENS CAN EMIGRATE TO WEST FREELY 




From Times Wire Services 




EAST BERLIN 




East Germany's embattled Communist leaders, facing the worst political crisis 
since the nation's founding 40 years ago, said today that they will throw open 
their borders and let citizens emigrate directly to West Germany, including 
through the Berlin Wall to West Berlin. 


Communist Party media chief Guenter Schabowski, who made the stunning 
announcement, said the new ruling is effective immediately. He said people will 
still need exit visas but police stations have been told to issue them without 
delay. 


The new ruling, decided after a more restrictive draft travel law met with 
widespread rejection earlier this week, was a major concession in a country 
that once tried to pen its citizens in with the Berlin Wall, barbed wire and 
automatic rifles set to fire on fleeing refugees. 


The move could leave the wall -- a symbol of the differences between East and 
West -- as a mere monument to the Cold War. 


East Germany opened a legal route to the West through Czechoslovakia last 
Friday, leading to a weeklong renewed exodus from the country that reached over 
50,000 by today. 


"Today, the decision was taken that makes it possible for all citizens to leave 
the country through East German border crossing points," Schabowski said. 


Schabowski said the new ruling applies to all border crossings through the 
Berlin Wall to West Berlin and through the "Iron Curtain" frontier to West 
Germany. 


West German officials estimate that between 1.2 million and 1.4 million 
frustrated East Germans have applied to leave their Communist homeland. 


Over 200,000 have left so far this year, about half of them legally. 


According to Schabowski's statement, later carried by the official ADN news 
agency, private tourists intending to return also would be free to take any 
border crossing out of the country. 


Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the announcement a "very positive 
development." 


"We've been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a basic human 
right. We've been talking a long time about open borders. We've been talking a 
long time about the importance of seeing the wall come down," he said. 


East Germany's mass migration westward started this summer as its frustrated 
citizens began sneaking through the gap in the "Iron Curtain" provided by 
reformist Hungary. 


It escalated in September when Budapest threw open the frontier, letting out a 
flood of emigrants on "freedom trains" and their own sputtering little Trabant 
cars. 


Thousands of East Germans packed Bonn's embassy in Prague to overflowing three 
times in the last two months, forcing East Berlin to allow three more waves of 
"freedom trains" to leave before it finally gave up. 


Since last Friday, East Germans have been able to take a legal exit route 
through Czechoslovakia. 


Earlier today, East Germany's Communist elite called an emergency party 
conference and a parliamentary session to tackle the country's deepest crisis. 


The decision-making Central Committee, still in special session after voting in 
a new ruling Politburo Wednesday, scheduled the conference for Dec. 15-17, and 
Shabowski said it might purge a large part of the present Central Committee.

GREEN STRIP URGED TO REPLACE BERLIN WALL 




By Reuters 




EAST BERLIN 




East Germany's fledgling Greens movement wants the demolished Berlin Wall 
replaced by a "green strip" of trees, vines and ivy, a Communist Party 
newspaper reported Friday. 


"Let's not replace the Cold War with concrete. Turn the Wall green," the Green 
Party and the Green League Assn. said in a statement published by the Berliner 
Zeitung. 


East Germany opened the Wall, a symbol of Cold War confrontation, on Nov. 9, 
allowing its citizens to travel freely to the West for the first time since 
1961.

EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 




My wife and I have followed the events in Berlin. When the "crossing" was 
announced, tears formed in my eyes. I was dramatically reminded of our 
country's freedom. 


A generation of Germans was permitted to experience what we, as Americans, can 
take for granted. We visited East and West Berlin a few years ago. To see the 
city, the wall, and the Brandenburg Gate from both sides was sobering. 


The wall is now breached! Surely it must give genuine happiness for Americans 
to know that native Berliners are now granted the privilege of visiting a part 
of their own city.

EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 




Your Nov. 10 headline "East Germany Opens Borders" was electrifying despite the 
other stunning news in the Eastern Bloc countries. 


Who would have expected all these changes to take place in our lifetime? Some 
of us even thought that it would take a world war to bring about these 
upheavals. 


Now instead of stockpiling our nuclear arsenals we should devote our energy and 
resources to combatting crimes, eradicating drugs, perfecting our means of 
production and developing the system that can enhance the quality of life in 
this planet.

BERLIN WALL WILL BE PULLED DOWN, EAST GERMAN TELLS HAVEL 




From Times Wire Services 




The Berlin Wall, which symbolized the schism between Eastern and Western Europe 
for 28 years, will be pulled down, an East German official said today in a 
dramatic demonstration of the liberalization of the East Bloc. 


East German head of state Manfred Gerlach told visiting Czechoslovak President 
Vaclav Havel that the wall will be torn down. 


"We are pulling down the wall. It has become superfluous. It will be replaced 
by normal border markings," Gerlach said in the interview with the West German 
daily, Bild. 


Gerlach said that no date has been set for the wall's removal but that the East 
German government would discuss it soon. 


Bild said it interviewed him after he had taken Havel to see the wall and the 
historic Brandenburg Gate today. 


Havel told reporters that he was amazed that the wall, built in 1961 and a 
symbol of Germany's and Europe's division until East Germany opened its borders 
in November, is still standing. 


"Gerlach told me work would soon start to tear it down. I told him if he had 
any problems we could send some independent Czechoslovak workers to help free 
of charge," he said to loud applause. 


Havel also told journalists he would like to say "Ich bin ein Berliner" -- "I 
am a Berliner" -- as did President John F. Kennedy during his visit to Berlin 
in June, 1963, two years after the wall was built. 


"I would like to take the liberty to repeat this sentence at a new time and in 
a new context," Havel said. 


He said all walls and barriers in Europe must fall. 


Built by Soviet-backed East German troops Aug. 13, 1961, the wall was first 
breached last Nov. 9 as East German authorities were moving away from the 
Stalinist policies that had been their trademark for 40 years. 


Havel visited the East German capital briefly before seeing West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Munich, his first official visits since he was 
elected president Friday as part of an agreement among the Czechoslovak 
government, opposition groups and the Communist Party. 


His trips to the Germanys ahead of one to the Soviet Union reflected a shift in 
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy. 


Havel said his visits originally were to be symbolic but turned out to be 
"working visits." 


"We managed to discuss many concrete issues," he said. 


In response to a question, Havel said he is opposed to the death penalty but he 
said last week's execution of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife 
may have saved many lives. 


After talks with Gerlach and Prime Minister Hans Modrow, Havel praised recent 
developments in East Germany, which has moved away from the Stalinist policies 
it had adhered to since its founding 40 years ago. 


"All of us Europeans must thank the GDR (East Germany) for having started 
pulling down one of the worst walls," said Havel, a playwright and essayist, 
who gained prominence during the spring 1968 uprising in Prague that was 
crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks. 


"This decade must become the decade of Europeans," said Kohl after meeting with 
Havel in Munich. 


The Czechoslovakian leader also met with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President Richard von Weizsaecker and opposition leader 
Hans-Jochen Vogel. 


Havel, who was jailed for five years for his opposition to the Communist 
authorities, was awarded the annual Peace Prize of the Frankfurt Book Fair last 
year. The Czechoslovakian government had prevented his traveling to West 
Germany to collect the award. 


Earlier, Havel declared a New Year's amnesty for common criminals and said his 
biggest task is to lead Czechoslovakia toward free elections without violence. 


Czechoslovak Justice Minister Dagmar Buresova said in a radio address that the 
amnesty will be extensive because many prisoners are serving excessively harsh 
sentences. But she said corrupt public officials will be excluded from the 
amnesty. 


It was not immediately clear how many prisoners will be affected by the 
amnesty.

EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 




Like him or not, Mikhail Gorbachev is the winner and new champion. 


He has just taken the title of the Great Emancipator from our own Abe Lincoln. 


With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gorbachev, wittingly or unwittingly, now has 
freed more people than any man in history. 


And he's done it peacefully, avoiding international and civil war.

REAGAN LIBRARY TO RECEIVE BIG CHUNK OF BERLIN WALL; 


DONATION: THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL ATTEND AN APRIL 12 CEREMONY WHERE THE 
6,000-POUND PIECE WILL BE PRESENTED. 




By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




A 6,000-pound section of the Berlin Wall will become part of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. 


The enormous piece of the infamous wall is the first gift to be installed at 
the library, said Charles Jelloian, director of operations for the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Foundation in Los Angeles. 


The section of wall will be presented to Reagan on April 12 by an East German 
organization during a special ceremony at the library site west of Simi Valley. 


In an apparent show of support for a unified Germany, officials from East and 
West Germany will be at the ceremony, said Reagan spokeswoman Cathy Goldberg. 


Measuring 9 1/2 feet tall and 3 1/2 feet wide, the section was donated by the 
Berlin Wall Commemorative Group. 


The 26 1/2-mile-long Berlin Wall that divided the city of Berlin was erected by 
East Germany with help from the Soviet Union in 1961. The wall was built to 
prevent refugees from fleeing to the West. 


Parts of the wall between Brandenburg and the Allied crossing point were torn 
down in February. 


Although it is not the first gift of a political nature given to Reagan, the 
wall may be the heaviest and bulkiest piece included in the museum collection, 
Jelloian said. 


Unlike more than 30,000 presidential artifacts in storage, the wall section 
will immediately go into the completed portion of the library. 


However, the public will not be able to see the wall until the library opens in 
early 1991. The library is little more than half-completed. 


The wall section does pose some problems in planning the exhibit that 
eventually will be stored in the 25,000-square-foot-museum, Jelloian said. 


"We're thinking about how we're going to get it up the hill," he said.

GERMANY, SOVIET UNION OK NONAGGRESSION PACT 




From Times Wire Services 




BONN 




As Germans celebrated the first anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a historic nonaggression treaty 
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl today and got a hero's welcome for letting the wall 
and the Iron Curtain collapse. 


Both Kohl and Gorbachev stressed the importance of the historical changes that 
have allowed closer ties as they signed the broad agreement that is to serve as 
the foundation of future relations. 


"Having signed this document one could hardly . . . think about until recently, 
we have officially ended a whole historical process and opened a deep 
perspective for ourselves," Gorbachev said. 


In the treaty, both nations pledge not to attack the other and to honor the 
borders of all European nations. 


The upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, met in Berlin for the first time 
since 1959 to commemorate the opening of the wall that signaled the collapse of 
East Germany's Communist Party system and the triumph of democracy movements 
across Eastern Europe. 


But there was a commemoration of a somber sort, too, as the date is the same as 
the anniversary of a 1938 Nazi pogrom in which Germans set fire to synagogues 
and wrecked Jewish-owned shops, a foretaste of the Holocaust. 


"In our history, Nov. 9 is an ambivalent date -- a day of joy, a day of horror 
and of shame," Bundesrat President Henning Voscherau said. But, "A year ago, on 
Nov. 9, 1989, the people overthrew a dictatorship in Germany for the first time 
in our history," he continued. "Since then, Nov. 9 has become a shining light 
in our history as well." 


At a ceremony commemorating "Kristallnacht" (The Night of Broken Glass), German 
Jewish leader Heinz Galinski indirectly criticized the government's recent 
decision to halt Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union after a wave of 
applications for asylum. 


"To allow Jewish life in this country to wither away would mean bowing once 
again to the will of the Nazi state," he said. 


Berlin artist Ben Wagin laid the foundation stone outside the Reichstag 
building for a memorial to more than 190 Germans killed trying to cross the 
East-West German border, 80 of them at the Berlin Wall. 


The wood and stone memorial will stand in the former "death strip" beside the 
wall, once a deadly obstacle course of dog runs, tripwires, searchlights and 
guard towers manned by troops with orders to shoot would-be escapees. 


Only a few sections of the 107-mile wall still stand. And those sections have 
been chipped away by souvenir hunters.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS 




By STEVE HARVEY, From staff and wire reports 




It's the kind of off-screen situation you might expect in Hollywood: 


A performer has the female lead in a television series although he is actually 
a male. And he virtually refuses to perform on camera or cooperate at publicity 
sessions unless his young mistress is sitting nearby. 


His agent even brought along the mistress to the Headliners Awards banquet 
staged over the weekend by the Los Angeles Press Club at the Biltmore Hotel. 
She sat at a separate table while the actor received an award. 


"He loses interest in things if he doesn't see her sitting there," explained 
one of the people in his entourage. 


The mistress goes by the flashy name of Falcon. 


The actor, we're sorry to say, boys and girls, is . . . Lassie. 


Barbara Adams writes, "While I was moving at a snail's pace from Mandeville 
Canyon due to the slide on Pacific Coast Highway, I was following a Mercedes 
with a license plate that read: 


"'PCH CLSD."' 


Incidentally, if you're a member of the These-Things-Happen-in-Threes cult, you 
no doubt took comfort from the fact that, following the landslide that shut 
down PCH and the shipwreck that closed Culver Boulevard, a small plane landed 
on the Golden State Freeway Sunday. 


Customers with coupons for one Long Beach car wash should read the small print, 
especially if the grime on their car could be carbon-dated. 


Now that East Germany's leaders have stopped using the Berlin Wall as a 
restraining device, an Encino capitalist wants to buy it. But it may not be for 
sale. 


"I phoned the embassy today (Monday) and they said they'd probably want to keep 
it," said Barry Stuppler, a rare coin dealer who has offered to give East 
Germany $50 million for the 28-mile-long concrete wall. 


"They pointed out that the Chinese have used their wall for a tourist 
attraction and said they (East Germany) might do the same." 


Stuppler's plan is to open a factory in East Germany that would break the wall 
into several million 3-inch pieces that would be sealed in plastic and sold -- 
accompanied by certificates of authenticity -- for up to $100 each. 


"We would hire East Berliners to produce them, and they would find out what 
entrepreneurship is all about," Stuppler said. 


He said the merchandising idea occurred to him after he saw TV pictures of 
joyful West Berliners chipping away at the wall with hammers after East Germany 
announced an end to travel restrictions for its citizens. 


Stuppler said that since making his offer, he has heard from several people who 
would like to invest in his scheme as well as people who have tried to interest 
him in others. 


For example, he said, "One had an idea for a scented ball for garbage 
disposals." 


The telephone system at Banning High in Wilmington is in danger of flunking 
out. 


Faculty members recently received this bulletin: 


"Due to the phone problems if you get any calls, remember to get the person's 
name and phone number right away before you get cut off!!!"

BERLIN'S HISTORIC BRANDENBURG GATE REOPENS; 


GERMANY: RAIN FAILS TO DAMPEN THE CROWD'S ENTHUSIASM AS THE SYMBOL OF A DIVIDED 
LAND GETS TWO NEW BORDER OPENINGS. 




By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




WEST BERLIN 




The Brandenburg Gate, the Cold War symbol of a divided Berlin, a divided 
Germany and a divided Europe, was reopened Friday afternoon amid joyous scenes 
undampened by gray skies, relentless rain and the quickly gathering darkness. 


The historic, six-columned Grecian-style monument in the heart of the sprawling 
former capital of the German Empire was overwhelmed by East and West Berliners 
who swarmed around it, reveling in this long-awaited Christmas gift. 


The Berlin Wall was breached in two places at either side of the Brandenburg 
Gate, leaving a staunch, thick portion of the wall in place. But the wall 
itself seemed almost superfluous, as young people climbed over it, posing for 
pictures and waving champagne bottles, then jumped down on the other side. 


The two new border crossings, which had been prepared by East German engineers 
all night Thursday, were formally opened at 3 p.m. Friday by West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on the east 
side of the wall. 


As Kohl and Modrow walked through the central arch of the 200-year-old gate, 
originally built to separate old Berlin from the fields to the west, Modrow 
declared: "This is where the German Reich went down in flames lit by German war 
criminals. The burning stench of war must never again be smelled here. It must 
be a gate of peace." 


As he spoke, many East Germans in the crowd chanted: "Helmut, Helmut!" 


Kohl seemed purposely to avoid sounding the German reunification issue in his 
brief speech when he said: "Let us be patient and prudent in the steps we have 
to take to walk forward into our common future." 


But a banner said it for Kohl in English: "Berlin Is One Town -- Germany Is One 
Nation." 


West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper told the crowd: "Berlin is still divided but 
the people are no longer separated." 


East and West Berlin police officers made no attempt to interfere with 
celebrants atop the wall, nor with others who for the first time began banging 
away at the wall from the east side to chip off pieces. 


As the wine corks popped, the British Royal Welch Fusiliers band -- the gate 
stands in the British sector of West Berlin -- played marches, but then broke, 
incongruously, into "Deep in the Heart of Texas." 


Inspired by a trumpet player standing with thousands of other revelers on top 
of the wall, the crowd sang everything from "Amazing Grace" to "Such a Day as 
Wonderful as Today," an old Berlin folk favorite. 


Fireworks lent the occasion a festive atmosphere. 


The Berlin Wall has been opened at various checkpoints since Nov. 9, but the 
Brandenburg Gate had never served as a border crossing since the wall went up 
in 1961. 


Before the wall was erected, the gate had been the entryway between the two 
sides of the divided city. Under it passed the Unter Den Linden, once the most 
famous and elegant thoroughfare in Germany. 


In earlier times, the gate was the center arch for promenades by Prussian 
aristocrats, Nazi parades with Hitler in an open car and, in the end, for 
Soviet tanks marauding through it during the apocalyptic Battle for Berlin in 
1945. 


So for many Germans, the Brandenburg Gate's opening Friday has been the 
ultimate test of the East German government's decision to liberalize relations 
between East and West Berlin -- and the two Germanys. 


As Franz Bertele, West Germany's chief emissary to East Germany, put it as he 
wandered on the east side: "It's a great feeling to be able to walk under the 
gate after 28 years. We never thought we would live long enough to see this 
day. 


"My only problem is that I lost my wife in all the excitement. I'm trying to 
find her." 


One couple who were married in East Berlin on Friday decided to come through 
the new Brandenburg opening to have a ceremonial dinner in West Berlin. 
Dietrich and Sybile Schumann, she wearing a white hat and veil and carrying a 
bouquet of flowers, both said "wunderbar" -- wonderful. 


"My own parents met at the Brandenburg Gate in 1958," said Sybile. "So walking 
through on my wedding day is lovely -- even though it is raining." 


And under the tall columns, three generations of one East Berlin family were 
heading west -- for the moment. 


Grandfather Willi Szeszrat, son Juergen, and 8-year-old grandson, Mario, walked 
together toward the new opening. 


"We just wanted to be part of it all," said Juergen.

EAST GERMANY OPENS BORDERS; WALL HAS 'NO MORE MEANING'; 


EAST BLOC: THOUSANDS TEST THE NEW POLICY BY CROSSING TO WEST BERLIN. THEY'RE 
WELCOMED WITH CHEERS AND SONG. 




By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




EAST BERLIN 




The East German government threw open its borders Thursday and announced that 
its citizens now may travel freely to West Germany. Thousands of jubilant East 
Germans quickly tested the new policy by flocking to the crossing points in 
divided Berlin. 


At Checkpoint Charlie, a major crossing point, a huge crowd gathered. As East 
Berliners in small groups made their way through the last barrier to West 
Berlin, the crowds on that side welcomed them with cheers and songs. 


East German border guards, who obviously had no instructions on the new border 
policy, generally waved them through with puzzled smiles. 


"I'm watching history being made," said one West Berlin bystander. 


It was like New Year's Eve or a World Series victory celebration at this and 
other border crossings along the Berlin Wall. Late Thursday and early today, 
hundreds of people climbed atop the grim, grafitti-marred structure, long the 
symbol of the Iron Curtain dividing East and West. Some of them danced for joy 
there. 


The new border policy was explained by Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, who 
told a news conference here that East Germans would "promptly" be given permits 
to go to West Germany. He said they could stay there if they wish, or return to 
East Germany. 


"This means that the Berlin Wall has no more meaning," an East German official 
said Thursday night. 


"The long-awaited day has arrived," declared West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper. 
"The Berlin Wall no longer divides Berlin." 


Crowds swarmed through the streets long after midnight, auto horns blared, 
police sirens pierced the air, couples walked hand in hand toward the wall and 
people laughed and smiled, offering each other open wine and beer bottles. 


Some East Germans arriving at border crossings at Invalidenstrasse and 
Prinzstrasse in their small, sputtering Trabant autos were almost prevented 
from entering by the crowds gathered to greet them. But they made their way 
through to West Berlin's bright lights. 


Remarkably, many of the East Berliners returned later today to the drab, gray 
Eastern half of the city after sampling the bright lights of the West. 


"I just wanted to take a look at the Kurfuerstendamm," said one young man in 
his 20s, as he returned from West Berlin's famous shopping district and headed 
back through the wall to East Berlin. 


From their side, hundreds of West Berliners crossed into East Berlin, shouting, 
"The wall is gone, the wall is gone!" 


A huge crowd gathered next to the Reichstag building at the Brandenburg Gate -- 
the traditional scene of anti-wall demonstrations by West Berliners and the 
place where President John F. Kennedy uttered his famous line, "Ich bin ein 
Berliner." 


Many people climbed atop the wall there. At 3 a.m., lights at the gate were 
still blazing as the crowd called out: "Open the gate!" 


Beyond Berlin, as one analyst here put it: "This news is deeply significant. It 
changes the whole shape of Europe. It will take a while for the import of this 
to sink in." 


In the euphoria of Thursday night, there were few formalities for those surging 
through the checkpoints in Berlin. 


But beginning this morning, East Germans will be expected under the new open 
policy to get exit visas for travel abroad, whether permanent emigration or 
just a visit. 


They will be allowed to go through any crossing point in the Berlin Wall except 
Checkpoint Charlie, which is reserved for foreigners and military personnel. 


Whether emigrating or just visiting, they also may enter West Germany through 
the various crossings along the fortified inner-German frontier. 


West Germans long have been free to travel to East Germany by simply arriving 
at the border, paying a small fee and exchanging some West German money for 
East German currency. 


Schabowski, the spokesman for East Germany's Politburo, was asked about tearing 
down the Berlin Wall. 


"The opening of the wall does not answer its real purpose," he said. "There is 
still a whole complex of questions that will have to be discussed." 


He mentioned the state of the opposing military alliances in Europe -- the 
Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- and progress on arms 
control as factors bearing on the ultimate fate of the Wall. 


In Bonn, officials said that though East German emigrants are inundating the 
country, West Germany will accept all East Germans arriving there. 


"No one will be turned back," Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. 


Schaeuble warned that new arrivals can expect poor housing for a long time to 
come -- in what was seen as an effort to discourage the flood of immigrants. 


"For this reason," he said, and because of the cold season, every German from 
East Germany should think carefully before they come here." 


A session of the West German Parliament broke into the national anthem on 
hearing the news from East Berlin about opening the borders. 


Bundestag member Willy Brandt, the former chancellor who was mayor of West 
Berlin in 1961 when the Berlin Wall went up, wept openly. 


The stunning news came after another tumultuous day in East Berlin during the 
three-day meeting of the policy-making Communist Party Central Committee. 


The Central Committee announced Thursday that there will be a special 
Parliament meeting Monday to approve the newly appointed reformist Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow. 


The Central Committee also called a rare meeting of the Communist Party 
Conference for Dec. 15-17 to discuss the economic, political and social crises 
swamping the country. 


An economic slowdown has been compounded by the flight of about 225,000 East 
Germans so far this year. 


West German estimates of those East Germans wishing to depart range from 
400,000 to 1.2 million -- in a nation of 16.6 million. 


Travel restrictions helped spark the massive demonstrations that brought East 
Germans out in unprecedented numbers onto the streets of East Berlin, Leipzig, 
Dresden, Halle, Schwerin and other cities. 


In his briefing on the lifting of travel restrictions, Schabowski said, "The 
decision was taken that makes it possible for all citizens to leave the country 
through East German crossing points." 


Schabowski's announcement seemed almost impromptu: He did not read from the 
prepared text he was given shortly before the briefing and seemed vague about 
some details. 


But he indicated that East Germans can take their identity cards to their local 
police station and apply for exit visas. Thus, they would not need passports, 
which not many East Germans have. 


The exit visas, Schabowski said, will be issued without red tape or demanding a 
reason for the travel. 


Similarly, he said those wishing to emigrate would be treated with dispatch. 


The decision, Schabowski said, will ease East German relations with Communist 
neighbor Czechoslovakia because emigrants no longer will be forced to pass 
through that country en route to the West. 


Curiously, some opposition elements in East Berlin did not applaud the 
Communist leaders' decision to open up travel to the West. 


Hans-Peter Schneider, a leader of the small opposition group Democratic 
Awakening, declared: "I doubt that it is a step that will keep the people here. 
I would have preferred it if they had said take your passport and get a visa 
and come back to us. 


"I think this step is a sign of the helplessness of our leaders." 


But for thousands of Germans, it was a sign of hope. 


About 2 a.m., an animal trainer walked through Checkpoint Charlie with a big, 
brown muzzled bear on a leash. 


"The bear is a symbol of Berlin," he said, "A united Berlin. We are now one 
city." 


"We couldn't believe we could get out," said one man who crossed with his wife. 
"We just wanted to try it. But we will return." 


Most people on foot and in cars appeared to have little baggage with them, 
indicating they planned to go back to the East -- in contrast to those who fled 
through Hungary and Czechoslovakia carrying all their family belongings. 


One woman who had been watching the drama for two hours said: "The Vopos (East 
German police) don't know what to do. So they have just been waving people 
through." 


Another man said: "A Vopo gave me a cigarette. I am keeping it as a souvenir. 
Ordinarily they would take your picture to put you on the blacklist." 


A bearded West Berliner, watching the amazing sight of East Berliners coming 
through the border crossing, said, "It looks like the Berlin Wall is going to 
be a relic -- just like the one in China."

NEW DAY DAWNS AT WALL FOR CHECKPOINT CHARLIE MUSEUM 




By PHILIPPE NAUGHTON, REUTERS 




WEST BERLIN 




After 28 years of campaigning, West Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie Museum can 
finally get down to business. The business, that is, of being a museum. 


Standing just 50 yards from Europe's most famous East-West crossing point, the 
Checkpoint Charlie Museum has long been a focal point for the campaign to open 
up the Berlin Wall. 


Its run-down premises have been the site of scores of news conferences 
introducing escapees from the East to the Western press and trying to push home 
the message of the misery caused by the wall. 


Then on Nov. 9, its battle was suddenly won. The East German government made a 
shock decision to open its frontiers, giving East Germany's 16 million people 
their first chance in 28 years to travel freely to the West. 


"I only slept an hour that night. As a German, it was a wonderful experience," 
said Rainer Hildebrandt, who founded the museum in December, 1961, four months 
after the wall was built. 


With the wall now open at 15 points around the city, Hildebrandt's campaign for 
free travel between East and West Berlin is almost over. 


"Now we have to struggle for the 500 political prisoners who have not got out 
of East Germany; this is the only problem. But I'm sure there will be enough 
noise to get them out," Hildebrandt said. 


East Germany denies that it has any political prisoners. 


After that, Hildebrandt says, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum can simply be a 
memorial to the thousands of successful escapes from Eastern Europe during the 
last three decades. 


"We are lucky enough to have a monopoly. The official museums have always 
avoided the wall. They were always afraid of being considered right-wing," he 
said. 


Although East Germans flooding across Checkpoint Charlie so far seem reluctant 
to stop off at the museum, more than 1,000 people, mostly foreigners, shuffle 
past the exhibits every day. 


It is a powerful monument to human ingenuity, with its collection of escape 
tools reflecting the words on a sign above one exhibit: "Escape Is the Mother 
of Invention." 


Among them is the old English Alvis motorcycle in which Friedl Linke of Dresden 
made it to the West in 1969. Linke was hidden in the fuel tank. 


There are also the two hollowed-out surfboards in which 25-year-old Helke 
Dittrich escaped from East Germany 18 years later. She married the West German 
who smuggled her out. 


A total of 80 people died trying to cross the Berlin Wall, the last of them 
only this year. 


"There was a young man who tried to get across in February. He was hit by 39 
bullets," Hildebrandt said, still shaking in anger. "Can you imagine how his 
parents feel now?" 


The museum is also a memorial to escapes that went wrong, and for that reason 
most of the exhibits are from escapes that occurred away from the city. 


Hildebrandt and his friends in the August 13 Community Action Group -- named 
after the date in 1961 when the East Germans first built the Wall -- always 
made a point of discouraging people from trying to cross it. 


"We said it clearly: It's too dangerous. Statistically, it was eight times 
safer passing through a third country like Hungary," he said. 


In numerical terms, the most successful escapes from East Berlin were through 
tunnels under no-man's land in the early days. In 1962, 57 people tunneled to 
the West in 48 hours before East German authorities discovered their escape 
route. 


Of all the thousands of escapes, however, Hildebrandt likes to tell the story 
of one -- "the easiest and most original." 


It happened one day in 1967 when a young East German marched boldly into 
Checkpoint Charlie, passing by several sets of controls before being stopped by 
a guard. 


He told the guard he was an Austrian going to see his dying mother in the west 
of the city, adding that he had already turned his passport in for checks. The 
guard called two colleagues to look after him and went off to look for the 
missing passport. 


"What's your problem then?" one of the arriving guards asked. 


The young man promptly changed his story. 


"I am an Austrian and I've just heard my mother is dying in East Berlin. The 
problem is I've not got my passport on me," he said. 


"They'll never let you in!" the guard declared. "I'd just head back west if I 
were you and fetch it."

EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 




Over the last few months I have been watching, reading, and thinking about the 
seemingly momentous events occurring in this world of ours. I am a strong 
national security advocate (went to West Point and work in the defense 
industry), and yet I find myself wondering if I should change careers. The 
Berlin Wall is coming down and I am greatly moved. To all those who would 
continue to subvert the will of the people I say, let freedom ring and 
democracy reign so that "government of the people, by the people and for the 
people shall" spread throughout this earth. 


Let us rejoice and act that our peoples may move forward, together, as there is 
much to do. There are scourges that must be addressed; toxic wastes, poverty, 
homelessness, alcoholism, disease, natural disasters, a failing infrastructure 
of roads, bridges, dams, and an environment that bleeds and cries for help. As 
I look in wonderment at these incredible times, sensing vast changes, I am 
grateful to God, and ask how can I help? The Statue of Liberty must have wiped 
some tears away as her arms spread its welcome to our Eastern Bloc friends. I 
know I did.

EAST GERMAN PARTY SEEKS COALITION; 


EUROPE: WEST GERMANY RENEWS ITS OFFER OF AID KEYED TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
REFORMS. 




By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




EAST BERLIN 




The newly elected East German prime minister, Hans Modrow, opened talks with 
non-Communist Party leaders Tuesday in an effort to form what he called a 
"genuine coalition government." 


He and Communist leader Egon Krenz conferred with the heads of four small 
parties that have suddenly displayed independence after years of serving as 
Communist Party satellites. 


In Bonn, West German officials again offered massive financial aid to East 
Germany -- providing that the government introduces stringent economic and 
political reforms. 


The East German regime is also considering opening up the Berlin Wall near the 
Brandenburg Gate, East Berlin's best-known monument and symbol, according to 
the official news agency ADN. 


But Modrow was quoted in Tuesday's editions of the West German newspaper Bild 
as saying that while the Berlin Wall can remain open to travel, it must remain 
standing. 


"In our country, there is little criminal activity . . . cases of AIDS 
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and drugs are virtually unknown. Our 
people are asking themselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is," Bild 
quoted him as saying. 


The number of people crossing the Berlin Wall on Tuesday was estimated at 
180,000. 


At the same time, West German Red Cross officials reported that the number of 
East German refugees approaching them about returning home has reached 10,000. 
Counseling services for potential returnees have been set up at West German 
relocation camps to advise East Germans whether they will be penalized if they 
go back. 


In trying to form a coalition regime, Modrow sought out the leaders of the four 
small parties: the Democratic Farmers' Party, the Christian Democratic Union, 
the Liberal Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party. 


These smaller parties, which in the past rubber-stamped Communist orders, have 
seats in the Parliament and have been increasingly critical of government 
policies and the Communists. 


Communists occupy 39 of the 43 Cabinet posts, and Modrow is expected to reduce 
the size of the Cabinet as well as make it more of a coalition. ADN gave no 
details of the meeting, and Modrow did not say whether the opposition would 
join his conception of a coalition government. 


Guenter Schabowski, a prominent member of the Politburo, resigned as party 
chief for East Berlin, ADN reported. Political analysts say Schabowski, 
considered to be a leading reform-minded politician, may receive an important 
post in Modrow's Cabinet. 


He earlier had indicated he might surrender the city post because of a heavy 
workload. He remains in the Politburo and as the party's propaganda chief. He 
was replaced as party chief for the capital by Hans Albrecht. 


Meanwhile, the new, non-Communist Speaker of the East German Parliament said he 
will seek to change the first article of the country's constitution, which 
defines the Communist Party's leading role in society. The party has used the 
provision to justify its monopoly on power. 


Guenther Maleuda told a meeting of his Democratic Farmers' Party faction in 
Parliament that the Communist Party is to blame for East Germany's economic, 
social and political problems. 


The West German pledge of massive financial aid to help rebuild East Germany's 
economy had been made before and was conditional on political and economic 
reforms that the Communists have so far rejected. 


But West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann was more specific, offering 
a six-point plan that would include investments and joint ventures, as well as 
revamping the nation's dilapidated communications and transport systems. 


Haussmann did not specify a figure for the aid and said the plan would be 
useless if East Germany fails to carry out a "thorough change" in its centrally 
directed economy. East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a 
complete free-market system. 


Haussmann compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan, brainchild of U.S. 
Secretary of State George C. Marshall, which sent more than $12 billion in U.S 
aid from 1948-51 to help war-devastated Europe return to prosperity. 


In West Berlin, the rumors that a new border crossing would be punched through 
the Berlin Wall near the historic Brandenburg Gate drew about 200 West 
Berliners to a chilly vigil Tuesday night. 


Police chiefs from both sides of the wall conferred by phone, and it was 
understood afterward that "nothing will happen tonight," a West Berlin police 
spokesman said. 


"We don't know if and when it will go down," he added. 


Ten East German guards stood almost casually atop the wall, gazing down at the 
throngs of West Berliners and reporters, some of whom had staked out their 
spots with pup tents. Television lights cast a bright glow on the 
graffiti-covered western face of the wall. 


Behind the barricade, floodlights illuminated the gate itself, which came to 
separate the city into Allied and Soviet zones after World War II, also 
severing Berlin's busiest boulevard -- Unter Den Linden. West German police 
kept the crowd about 20 feet back from the wall, which some Berliners danced 
atop last week. 


People waited in line to climb the two viewing platforms erected by the West 
years ago to allow tourists a peak over the forbidden wall and the gate behind 
it. 


Times staff writer Tamara Jones contributed to this story. 




BACKGROUND 


The Brandenburg Gate, the site where East Germany is considering creating a new 
opening in the Berlin Wall, has for decades served as a mocking reminder of 
Germany's defeat in World War II. Lying in East Berlin just beyond the wall in 
the heart of the divided city, the monument, topped with a bronze statue of the 
Goddess of Victory in a chariot, was erected in 1788-91 to celebrate military 
victories and was named after the German state that later became Prussia. 
Modeled on the Propylaea, the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens, it was 
severely damaged in World War II and has been completely rebuilt.

EAST AND WEST GERMANS MARK ANNIVERSARY OF BERLIN WALL 




From Associated Press 




WEST BERLIN 




At a cross ringed with barbed wire, Germans from East and West paid solemn 
tribute today to the victims of the Berlin Wall on the 29th anniversary of its 
construction. 


Eighty East Germans died trying to escape across the now-crumbling barrier that 
began separating the city on Aug. 13, 1961. 


The best-known of them is Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old East Berlin worker cut 
down by Communist border guards' bullets in 1962. Fechter lay bleeding to death 
for nearly an hour before he was hauled away. 


"Here where Peter Fechter died, we can feel how much suffering the wall 
caused," East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina said during the ceremony this 
morning. 


Schwierzina stood beside the cross erected as a memorial to Fechter in West 
Berlin. It is near where Fechter lay dying and calling out, "Help me." 


A weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony on Aug. 17, 1962, is 
tacked to the dark wood. 


About 300 people, most of them Germans, gathered for the brief service under a 
brilliant sun. More than a dozen large flower arrangements were placed before 
the cross. 


Although the wall has disappeared there, windows in buildings on the eastern 
side still have the bars that kept people from jumping to freedom. 


In years past, the Communist East Germans marked the wall's anniversary with 
bombastic military parades that drew criticism from the Western Allies. 


With the wall vanishing and Germans rushing to unification, today's service was 
the first joint memorial officially linking both sides. 


West Berlin officials promised that part of the Berlin Wall will be kept 
intact. 


"The wall cannot disappear completely," said city councilor Erich Paetzold. He 
said a remainder will be preserved "so that we don't forget."

Pankow U-bahn (underground) station. 'If I had to change trains on the
U-bahn, as I did before, you would not find me in a good humour,' she said,
tucking her silver grey hair under her woollen hat.
Mrs Bruhn lives in Prenzlauer Berg, east Berlin, the heart of east Germany's
avant-garde and intellectual life before the Berlin Wall fell in November
1989.
Above the gentle hum of the orange-coloured train, Mrs Bruhn said she did
not believe the city was truly united until a few weeks ago: 'Every time I
wanted to visit my friends in the western part of the city, I had to keep
changing trains. I am 70 years old, so I don't like going up and down all
those stairs.'
The holiday season has brought a particular delight for Mrs Bruhn - and
other inhabitants of Berlin. For the first time since 1961, the two parts of
the city's main underground line have been reconnected beneath the heart of
the Mitte, the centre of prewar Berlin.
The U2 now runs west from Ruhleben, near the former Olympic Stadium in west
Berlin, cuts through Potsdamer Platz, for decades part of the 'death-strip'
that flanked the Berlin Wall, to end in Pankow, in the north of east Berlin.
'I really feel, now that the old stations have been opened, we Berliners are
at long last united,' said Mrs Bruhn.
Until 1961, Berliners used the line to cross the city, though their
movements were restricted by regulations imposed by the four allied powers,
particularly the Russians who controlled the eastern sector.
'The line linked Kurfurstendamm, the fashionable shopping district and its
smart coffee houses, with the old, historic heart of east Berlin,' said Mr
Wolfgang Gobel, spokesman for Berlin's public transport department.
'You could do your shopping, get off at Potsdamer Platz, walk over to the
Brandenburg Gate, and still manage to stroll down Unter den Linden'  - one
of Germany's finest streets until the second world war.
But once the Wall was built, the underground stations which had run through
the centre of Berlin were closed off by east Germany's communists. Its
border guards, in knee-high black leather boots, patrolled the desolate,
damp and rat-infested stations, to ensure no easterner used the underground
as an escape route. Few ever did.
'It is my first time on the line for over 33 years. To tell you the truth,
it's wonderful and it's so good for the city's morale. It feels like one
city,' said Mr Reinhard Schulze, a mechanical engineer. Mr Schulze and his
friend, Mr Andreas Fieberger, had just travelled the length of the line,
east to west, from Pankow to Ruhleben. Both work for a small machine-tool
manufacturer located in west Berlin.
More than 380,200 people commute from the eastern to the west German states
 -120,000 coming from east Berlin. 'There is no doubt that linking the two
parts of U2 has economic and psychological consequences,' said Mr Gobel.
'It's not only good for the commuters; there's more of an incentive for west
Berliners, who for many reasons have been slow to see the other part of
Berlin, the museums, to see how easterners live, simply to explore their own
city.'
Such sentiments, however, sometimes fall on deaf ears in the west of the
city. 'Why should I bother to go over to east Berlin? There's nothing to
see,' said Heinz, a 53-year-old engineer, travelling on the western part of
the line. 'I've never been over there.'
But he appeared to be in a minority. Most Berliners, appear uncommonly
enthusiastic. Ms Helga Wetten, a vintner, said: 'The existence of the Wall
forced the administrations of both cities to prove each side was better than
the other. We don't have to prove anything any more. The U2 is at last
making us slowly become a normal city again.'

BERLIN'S WALL IS BEING CUT AWAY -- CHIP BY CHIP; 


EUROPE: A FEW GERMANS ARE SELLING SMALL CHUNKS OF THE WALL AS SOUVENIRS. 




By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




WEST BERLIN 




All day Sunday, the cold, clear air along the Berlin Wall rang with the clang 
of hammer on chisel and the crunch of rock against concrete. 


Little by little, the Berlin Wall, for 28 years a symbol of Europe's division, 
is being whittled away. 


As a million or more East Germans headed for the shopping districts of West 
Berlin over the weekend, thousands of others promenaded along the 
graffiti-decorated western face of the wall -- and watched hundreds, perhaps 
thousands taking their turn at chipping away at that symbol. 


For while the Berlin Wall has been dramatically outdated by free passage 
through new checkpoints, it still stands as the detested barrier between East 
and West. 


A few West Berliners were selling small chunks of the wall as souvenirs; others 
wanted to knock a hole in it to look through; and some said they wished to be 
part of history by helping the wall crumble. 


"Man, I just want to help a little to remove the wall," said Dan Epstein, 23, 
of Berkeley, Calif., a student in London. 


"This is a pretty exciting thing for the world," he said. "I think a lot of 
people are here swinging away just to make a statement about the wall." 


Epstein carried a large chisel. His friend, Aaron Singer, 22, of Colorado 
Springs, wielded the hammer. They came to Berlin by train last Monday and have 
been watching events at the wall ever since. 


"Nov. 9 was my birthday," said Singer. "I heard the wall was opened and decided 
to come over. This is the biggest historical event in Berlin since World War 
II." 


"The wall is not easy to chip away," added Epstein. "It has got to be the 
sturdiest piece of construction in all of East Germany." 


The two Americans said they had been watching the various techniques used for 
breaching the wall. Many of the amateur demolition workers have hammers and 
chisels but some simply pick up rocks to flail away at the structure. 


"Most people pick a particular spot and keep plugging away at it," said Singer. 
"We have a pretty good place but it's not easy." 


Singer and Epstein were working at a stretch of the wall that runs south and 
then east from the Brandenburg Gate to Checkpoint Charlie. It is fashioned of 
concrete with reinforced steel rods, 12 to 15 feet high and formed of 
one-meter-wide panels. 


So for about every three feet along the wall there are joints sealed with 
mortar, and it is at these connection points that the hammers and chisels are 
levered to best advantage. Right now there are hundreds of small openings bored 
through the wall but no major breach -- except those made by the East Germans 
for the new border-crossing posts. 


Other wall-breakers concentrate on the circular rim of the wall, installed to 
prevent escapees from gaining a firm hold on the top of the barrier. 


The West Berlin police seem to take a casual attitude toward most of the 
amateurs trying to knock through the west side of the wall, but they quickly 
turn away anyone with professional equipment like power drills. 


As evening approached, however, West German police at some locations began 
confiscating hammers and other tools being used to chip at the barrier. Someone 
asked a policeman if he was embarrassed about taking away wall-breaching 
implements, and he replied, "Yes, but this is East German property." 


Sunday strollers stopped to watch energetic wall-breachers, many of whom gave 
away the small pieces or sold chunks for a mark or two. 


From Hamburg came reports of a much more ambitious commercial scheme. Ten tons 
of freight, described in official documents as "Pieces of the Berlin Wall," 
were put on an American Airlines flight for Chicago via New York, according to 
United Press International. UPI said reporters who saw inside the 19 
rectangular, plain wooden cases strung with nylon netting said they contained 
brownish-black pieces of stone covered with sand and plant roots. The shipment 
was brought to Hamburg airport Saturday on a truck, and sources there told UPI 
that the shipper was a "private citizen in West Berlin." American Airlines said 
it knew nothing about shipper or consignee. 


Here in Berlin, the most prized bits of wall are those surface pieces with 
graffiti paint, rather than simply a colorless lump of interior concrete. 


"Down with the wall!" called out one youth in English as he slammed a large 
hammer against the concrete. 


Nearby, a lively business has sprung up with vendors selling gluehwein -- 
spiced, mulled red wine. 


For those peeking through the holes in the wall, there is not much to see -- 
just the barren cleared ground and a few gray barracks-style buildings in East 
Berlin. 


In the distance is the second, inner wall, where East German armed guards still 
patrol. For now, that is an unattainable target for the amateur demolitionists 
of West Berlin.

EAST WARY OF WEST GERMAN AID OFFER 




From Times Wire Services 




EAST BERLIN 




East German newspapers today appeared to dismiss West Germany's offer of 
massive financial aid, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev reaffirmed his opposition to 
German reunification and sharply criticized Westerners who suggest that 
socialism has failed. 


Activity on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate at dawn suggested that an 
early opening of the symbol of German unity as an East-West crossing point was 
likely. 


But there were no signs of construction work on the eastern side of the Berlin 
Wall, and West German police said their East German colleagues had told them 
not to expect an opening during the course of the day. 


Opening the Brandenburg Gate is clearly a sensitive one for East Germany, given 
the symbolism of the six-column Grecian arch, scene of Prussian and Nazi 
triumphal parades. 


Diplomatic sources said the Soviets are likely to be playing a significant role 
in East-West negotiations about opening the gate, which spans the main trunk 
road through the heart of Berlin. 


Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung 
that East Germany can manage its own economic recovery, an indication that 
Bonn's conditional aid offer may be rejected. 


"I don't see any need to dramatize the internal or external financial 
situation" of East Germany, Arnold said. 


The government newspaper Bauern Echo, aimed at East Germany's farmers, warned 
of becoming too greatly influenced by West Germany. 


"Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout," the paper declared. 
"Yes to meeting again, no to reunification. The two German states are 
politically and economically too diverse." 


There was no official response from the government to West Germany's offer, 
which would require East Germany's ruling Communists to fundamentally reform 
their centrally planned economy. Communist officials have made it clear that 
they do not favor a full free-market system. 


Gorbachev for the second day warned Westerners not to expect German 
reunification. 


"Talking about reunification would mean interference in the affairs of West 
Germany and of the German Democratic Republic," Gorbachev said in a speech to a 
student meeting. 


Gorbachev said Westerners who claim the changes in the East signify the failure 
of socialism are engaging in "wishful thinking." He did not say who he was 
referring to. "We are expanding the potential of the socialist social system," 
he said.

They had gathered on Saturday at the site of the former Berlin Wall in
Bernauer street, 33 years to the day after east German troops moved in with
bulldozers to divide the city.
About 100 people, many frail and elderly, stood on this long, narrow strip
of wasteland in east Berlin. It had been turned into mud by the torrential
rain but they had come determined not to celebrate the collapse of the wall
nearly five years ago, but to demand from the German government the right to
regain property which they had been forced to leave when east German troops
ordered them out of their homes to make way for the wall on the night of
August 13 1961.
'All we want is justice,' says Mr Wolf-Dietrich Golz, who two years ago
helped establish an association for those seeking compensation or
restitution.
'The German government refuses to return our property to us,' says Mr Golz.
'Their excuse is that since all property along the Berlin Wall belonged to
the former east German defence ministry, it should automatically be passed
under the control of the German state. But why? Why is it that those whose
property was confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, or by the
communists between 1949 and 1990, can seek compensation or restitution, but
not us?'
The Berlin Wall ran like a snake along 165km of the city, cutting through
3,000 homes.
'I remember August 13 1961 very well,' says Mr Golz, 54. 'It was a warm,
quiet summer's night. We were living on Finkenkruger Street in Spandau, not
in the British zone, but in the eastern/Soviet zone. I had been writing a
love letter. Then I heard the dogs, the bulldozers, the soldiers. The next
morning, I looked out the window. Finkenkruger Street had been divided. We
were locked in.'
'Even before the wall had been built, it was sheer hell to live there. In
the late 1940s, when the Russians carved out their zone in east Berlin, life
became very difficult. We were surrounded by guards.'
Mr Golz's mother eventually moved to Bavaria, leaving the family house to
her son in her will. 'I was studying at the time in Dresden. I went back
from time to time to my home. Then in 1967, the home was flattened. I
received no notification. No compensation. Nothing.'
The wall along Finkenkruger Street has since been removed. All that remains
is a long avenue of overgrown grass and shrubs. East and West Berliners can
now see each other again. 'I want to return there and rebuild my house,'
says Mr Golz.
Over 1,400 Berliners who once lived on the site of the Berlin Wall want to
do the same, or else seek compensation. But Mr Gerhard Schiele, a Free
Democrat and member of Berlin's chamber of deputies, says the chances are
slim.
'Mr Theo Waigel (the finance minister) does not want to give the claimants
any compensation because it would cost too much money. And the justice
ministry, which used to be under Mr Klaus Kinkel (now the foreign minister),
and who helped draw up the unification treaty, is afraid that if the law is
amended it will create a precedent for other property claims. These are the
real reasons for the government holding onto their property, which by the
way, is very valuable.'
The dispute has not only pitted east Berliners against the German
government. It has caused a rift between the Berlin Senate and Bonn. 'The
Senate has repeatedly demanded a change in the law,' says Mr Klaus Kilian,
an official from the Senate's justice department. 'The Bundesrat (Upper
House) last June suggested some degree of restitution or compensation, but
the Bundestag (Lower House) will never agree. If it were allowed, it could
set a precedent for other claimants. These could include those whose land
was expropriated by the Soviet administration in eastern Germany between
1945 and 1949.'
Mr Kilian says the dispute is also delaying investment and planning in
Berlin. 'We cannot develop large sections of the former wall until this
matter is settled,' he says. 'Investors are very wary.'
In the meantime, former property owners along the Berlin Wall are determined
to continue their struggle. 'This is about justice,' says Ms Inge Bergk, a
veteran campaigner whose parents had lived on Bernauer Street. 'If East
Germany no longer exists, then the old law which placed all Berlin Wall
property under the communist defence ministry no longer exists as well. This
is our property and we want it back.'

OFF THE WALL; 


CHUNK OF THE BERLIN BARRIER UNVEILED AT REAGAN LIBRARY 




By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Folks, you may have caught the act during its long-running engagement, 28 years 
in Berlin, and now it's here, in Ventura County. 


Ladies and gentlemen, let's say "Ich bin ein Venturer," and give a big Simi 
Valley welcome to a big performer; the concrete you love to hate -- the Berlin 
Wall! 


Thursday, in a sunny outdoor ceremony that blended patriotism and razzmatazz -- 
a German oompah band direct from San Diego and Mel Torme singing the national 
anthem -- a 9 1/2-foot-high section of the Berlin Wall was unveiled at the 
Reagan Presidential Library in the Ventura County city, where the workmen wear 
caps that read "Building One for the Gipper." 


It's too big for a coffee table, and too small to restrain any freedom-loving 
person in Simi Valley, let alone East Berlin. But it will fit right into the 
archives, ephemera and landmarks of the Reagan presidency. 


Not quite three years ago, Reagan visited West Berlin and, in front of the 
Brandenburg Gate, demanded, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall." On Thursday, 
Reagan, dwarfed by the 6,338-pound piece, said his 1987 phrasemaking "wasn't 
merely a polite suggestion." 


The donated section is one of only seven complete wall panels in the United 
States. Such intact sections sell from $60,000 for a plain one to $125,000 for 
elaborately painted or graffitied specimens. 


This one, more pristine than the much-graffitied stretches of the wall, shows 
only a red butterfly hovering above flowers on a blue-green background, artwork 
that "obviously couldn't be more than a year old," said Joseph Sciamarelli, 
president of the Berlin Wall Commemorative Group, the exclusive U.S. 
distributor for the wall. 


The Reagan library "originally contacted the government of East Germany and 
asked how they could secure a section of the wall for the library," Sciamarelli 
said. He and his group decided "we didn't want Ronald Reagan to have to make a 
purchase of the wall, with his commitment and what he had done." So with 
fast-food magnate Carl Karcher to help with the buying and shipping costs, the 
wall came west, gratis. 


"It's very positive for the President to have a section of the Berlin Wall," 
said Sciamarelli. And, from a strictly business point of view, it's "good 
public relations" to "let people know the wall is available and it is an item 
that is for sale." 


For the 1,000-plus invited locals, and old Reagan associates like MCA Chairman 
Lew Wasserman, Reagan's former agent, Thursday's unveiling afforded them not 
only a look at Reagan and the wall, but it was the first chance to see what had 
been going on at the hilltop library building site. 


After the spit-and-polish of Reagan's presidency, the dedication had the 
easygoing mood of a block party. Nancy Reagan hoisted a yellow and orange paper 
sun parasol that wouldn't stay open, and once threatened to collapse around her 
head. 


The accordionist with the Bavarian Beer Garden band wore shades with his 
lederhosen. A few folks showed up in shorts and flip-flops. The contingent from 
the UCLA marching band blared out favorites like the theme from "Hawaii 
Five-O," and a Marine in the color guard muttered, "I could use a beer right 
now." 


The 38-minute ceremony, emceed by Johnny Grant, the so-called "Mayor of 
Hollywood," began with the band playing the movie fanfare from 20th Century Fox 
to welcome Reagan, a former Warner Bros. star. Also present were officials from 
East and West Germany, and a young woman who escaped from East Germany before 
the wall was brought down. 


The former President's own remarks were classic "easy listening" Reagan, 
stirring oratory now free of the political constraints of policy-making: The 
wall "shattered dreams and crushed hopes. It made us angry . . . it seemed for 
a time to be impenetrable," but when it came down, "that night, all 
freedom-loving people in the world were Berliners." 


"We accept it with solemn remembrances of the past and the resolution of what 
happened must never happen again. . . . Let our children and grandchildren come 
here and see this wall and reflect on what it meant to history. Let them 
understand that only vigilance and strength will deter tyranny." 


Tyranny was certainly on Ray Mulokas' mind. The Lithuanian-American, his wife, 
daughter and a friend wore black crepe paper armbands to the unveiling. 


"We weren't here to demonstrate, not to take away the good done by Ronald 
Reagan," he said. But "we hope we can celebrate with the East Germans one day." 


For Simi Valley student Jason Oliver, 15, one of the designated escorts who got 
"this close" to Reagan, it was on-the-job training for when he is president, in 
2016, he figures. He has dedicated himself to that goal "since I was 6 years 
old. That's been my life, except for like going to Disneyland." 


Locals snapped one another's picture in front of the fragment of wall. Boy 
Scouts collected the discarded Pepsi cups that were blowing away. 


And German bandsman Joe Dyke loaded up his musical gear for the drive back to 
San Diego. 


Sure, he liked it, he said. "Show business is my whole life."
