1,000 JUGGLERS SHOW SKILLS AT UCLA 




By ELSTON L. CARR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




Fifteen-year-old Jason Garfield, of Seattle, likes to be among his own kind, 
and this week he is. 


Garfield is one of more than 1,000 jugglers from 50 states and several foreign 
countries expected at the 43rd annual festival of the International Jugglers 
Assn., a five-day event of workshops, performances and competitions being held 
at UCLA. 


On Tuesday morning, the opening day of the event, Garfield felt at home among 
the 25 jugglers on the floor of Pauley Pavilion as they practiced their 
routines with a rainbow of clubs, rings and balls cascading above their heads. 


At the west end of the floor, near the free-throw line, Garfield's eyes were 
fixed on an invisible point above his head as he juggled seven clubs, which 
look much like bowling pins. His arms and the clubs blurred as he quickened his 
pace to send the blue and gold clubs from his hands into an arc above his head. 
He brought them down -- three in one hand, four in the other -- without a 
spill. 


Garfield began juggling at age 11. Two years later, he won the junior juggling 
championship in Denver. This year, he has qualified to compete in the senior's 
competition. 


The festival is the one time of the year that Garfield gets to mingle with 
other jugglers, whose skills range from beginner to advanced. Not only does it 
provide an opportunity to learn from others, but it does wonders for his 
self-esteem. Here, he is understood. 


"When I practice in Seattle, I practice by myself at a YMCA . . . and there's 
just these people there stretching, not juggling or anything," he said. "Most 
of them don't like me being there because they think juggling is for clowns and 
circuses and whatever. 


"But then I come here and people watch me and they say, 'Wow, you're good.' " 


In this country, juggling has evolved beyond its vaudeville and circus roots. 
Festival participants say it is a performance art that nets big fees at 
business conventions and at private parties. Jugglers have entertainment 
careers in nightclubs, on Las Vegas and Atlantic City stages, and as opening 
acts for celebrities. 


"Everyone associates it (juggling) with clowns and circuses," Garfield said. 
"That's something I'd really like to get rid of because I don't plan to be in a 
circus or on being a clown. My goal is to get a steady job on a stage, maybe in 
Las Vegas." 


Still to come in the five-day festival is the senior individual and team 
juggling championship to be held today at 7:30 p.m. at UCLA's Royce Hall. 


"Joggling," a 4-year-old sport of running and juggling, will be featured at the 
Drake Track Stadium at 10:30 a.m. Saturday. Jogglers will compete in 100-meter, 
one-mile and five-kilometer events, as well as a one-mile relay race. Those in 
the know expect records to be broken for both the 100-meter and the one-mile 
joggling events. The records now stand at 11.9 seconds for the 100-meter and 4 
minutes, 43 seconds for the one-mile event, according to the Guinness Book of 
World Records. 


Also on Saturday, other contests and demonstrations at Pauley Pavilion will 
start at 1:30 p.m. Representatives from the Guinness Book will document any 
records set at the demonstration. The festival will end with performances from 
world-class professional jugglers in the New Vaudeville Revue at 8 p.m. in 
Royce Hall. All events are open to the public.

juggling enthusiasts. More than 1,000 amateur and professional jugglers are 
expected to take part in the 43rd annual International Jugglers Assn. Festival 
and Competition at UCLA.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: YOUNG MARATHON 'JOGGLER' INTENDS TO KEEP RUNNING 
TOWARD THE SPOTLIGHT -- AND GRABBING FOR THE LAUGHS 




By Herbert J. Vida 




Mike Hebebrand was quite a sight running down the street in the recent Los 
Angeles Marathon. He was juggling three balls and a lot of people were 
laughing, but that's exactly what he wanted. 


"I'm an entertainer and a performer who wants to make people laugh," said the 
23-year-old Fullerton resident, who worked in a circus as a juggler while 
attending junior and senior high school. 


He said most people laughed or clapped as he passed by. "They get a kick out of 
it," he said. "I'm sure they think of me as being different, but not weird." 


But there was a serious side to his running the marathon. "I really wanted to 
break the world's record for marathon joggling, but I wasn't in the best of 
shape," he admitted. 


He ran and finished the Los Angeles Marathon without juggling in 1987 and 1988. 


The joggling record is 3 hours and 22 minutes, and Hebebrand missed it by 10 
minutes. Joggling is a combination of juggling and running. If a ball drops, "I 
have to go back to the spot it first dropped and start running again." He 
dropped a ball 10 times during his run. "I knew after 13 miles I wasn't going 
to break the record," said Hebebrand, who teaches physical education in South 
Hills High School in Covina. "I only averaged about 6 miles a day in training, 
and you have to go 10 to have a chance." 


He trained by running along the Balboa Bay beachfront, Fullerton horse trails 
and Griffith Park in Los Angeles. 


The one-time trapeze artist, wire walker and juggler with the defunct Great 
All-American Youth Circus has set his sights on breaking the record next year. 


"I'm going to be in the best shape of my life," said Hebebrand, who is in 
training for the October Iron Man Triathlon in Hawaii. He competed in the event 
in 1984 but failed to finish because of an injury. 


But he said juggling in the recent marathon gave him more fun than any of his 
other races. 


"I'm not a showoff, but I want to entertain people and make them laugh," he 
said. "It's like when the lights come on and the audience is in their chairs. 
Something starts to click in me." 


0 hebebrand has run in many parts of the world, taking spins around the 
Egyptian Pyramids and the Masada fortress in Israel. In another challenge, the 
Biola University graduate hitchhiked across the United States. He was 21 at the 
time. 


"I'm a pretty big guy (6 feet, 1 inch) so I felt I could take care of myself 
during the trip," he said. 


But he also likes to care for others. 


Besides coaching disabled children at the First Evangelical Free Church of 
Fullerton, "I stop on the freeway to help people," he said. "God has given us a 
lot in America and we don't tend to share enough, so I share the wealth that 
way." 


The rolling hills above the Coast Highway between Laguna Beach and Corona del 
Mar are slowly being ground away by bulldozers, a prelude to development. 


But watercolorist Christine Sullivan, a Corona del Mar landscape artist, is out 
there with paintbrushes to record the pristine beauty before the 
heavy-equipment operators take it away. 


"I thought of tactics like carrying a sign with a personal message to show my 
anger," she said, "but then I thought, 'Why don't I make a statement by doing a 
series of paintings of the area?' " 


Sullivan, one of the 160 artists and craftsmen who will exhibit their work at 
the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts starting July 7, said she has been been 
making daily trips to capture the scenes on canvas. 


"Some people might call it development," she said. "I call it digression. That 
whole area was a particular favorite of mine that sort of served as my 
psychological safety valve. 


Acknowledgments -- First place Bank of America Achievement Awards of $2,000 
each were presented to Fullerton's Sunny Hills High student Ronald Strauss in 
the science and math category and Santa Ana's Foothill High student Joanna 
Brooks in liberal arts.

O'SULLIVAN HOPES TO ADD TO REPUTATION IN TIMES MEET 




When Eamonn Coghlan, world record-holder in the mile, decided to retire, fellow 
Irishman Marcus O'Sullivan quickly took over as "Chairman of the Boards." 


The 27-year-old O'Sullivan has been virtually unbeatable the past two years and 
in 1988 ran the fastest 1500 meters ever indoors, 3:35.4 at East Rutherford. He 
also ran the third-fastest mile in history, 3:50.94, a figure basted only by 
Coghlan. 


Friday night at the Forum in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games, O'Sullivan will be 
running the mile against two other Irishmen, Frank O'Mara and Ray Flynn, Jose 
Abascal of Spain, Nourdine Morcelli, Algeria (Riverside City College), and the 
lone American, Jeff Atkinson, winner of last year's Olympic Trials. 


O'Sullivan -- as expected -- won the mile here last year and then went on to 
wrap up another superb season by winning the USA/Mobil Indoor Mile title in 
3:59.85. 


At Seoul in 1988, he finished eighth in the 1500 meters in 3:38.39. That race 
was missing Morocco's Said Aouita, the world record-holder at that distance, 
who had a leg injury. 


After winning his first two races ever run indoors on the boards last weekend 
on the East coast, Aouita indicated he might like to try the mile at the Forum. 


"When O'Sullivan runs by himself, that's one story," Aouita said. "When he runs 
with Aouita, that's another story." 


Can O'Sullivan beat Aouita should the Moroccoan(sp?) opt for the mile rather 
than the scheduled 3000 meters? 


"It's dangerous to predict what a race is going to be like because what happens 
is you're not ready for the unexpected," O'Sullivan says. 


"You ride it along and wait for the cards to unfold and everyone, sooner or 
later, will show their cards. It could be some guy in the field saying, 'The 
hell with you. I'm going from the beginning. You either come with me or you 
don't come.' 


"It's almost like a game of poker." 


A possible O'Sullivan-Aouita confrontation will depend on Aouita, says meet 
director Will Kern. "He can run any distance he wants." 


If Auoita decides on the 3000 meters he will face Steve Scott, who set the 
Times record at the distance last year at 7:57.78; a pair of U.S. Olympians 
Doug Padilla and Brian Abshire, Mark Junkerman and countryman Aziz Sahar.

COLOGNE TRACK AND FIELD; 


AOUITA EASILY BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN 3,000 METERS 




From Associated Press 




COLOGNE, West Germany 




Said Aouita of Morocco broke the oldest major running-event world record with a 
time of 7 minutes 29.45 seconds in the men's 3,000 meters at a Grand Prix track 
and field meet Sunday. 


Henry Rono of Kenya had set the manually timed record of 7:32.1 on June 27, 
1978, at Oslo, Norway. 


"It was the hardest of all world records to get," said Aouita, who also holds 
world records in the 1,500, 2,000 and 5,000, meters, as well as a world best in 
the rarely run two-mile race. 


"I wanted another world record. Three days ago, when I registered for the 
event, I knew I was going to win and set a world record." 


Aouita took over the lead with two laps to go, when pacesetter Charles 
Cheruiyot of Kenya dropped out. 


Yobes Ondieki of Kenya tried to follow Aouita, but the Moroccan ran the last 
lap by himself. 


"Every year I have gotten closer and closer to it (the record), but when I was 
younger I wasn't so worried because I had time," Aouita, 29, said. "Now I'm 
getting older. 


"I like the track here. It's very fast and the pacemakers did a great job." 


Aouita ran 7:32.23 at the same meet in 1986. That had been the second-fastest 
time. 


The only individual world record older than Rono's is in a field event -- Bob 
Beamon's long jump of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches set at the 1968 Olympic Games. 


Rono, who set four world records within a 90-day span in 1978, no longer holds 
one. 


Also Sunday, Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union barely missed breaking 
countryman Sergei Bubka's world pole vault record of 19-10 1/2. In his third 
attempt at 19-11, Gataullin appeared to have the necessary height, but toppled 
the bar with his chest. 


Butch Reynolds of the United States, the world record-holder, won the 400 
meters in 44.30, the second-fastest time of the year.

MUSYOKI COMES UP SHORT OF WORLD RECORD; 


BUT KENYAN IS FAST ENOUGH TO WIN BASTILLE DAY 8K IN NEWPORT BEACH 




By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 




Standing at the start of the Bastille Day 8K in Newport Beach Sunday morning, 
William Musyoki glanced up at the overcast skies, bent down to touch his toes, 
and readied himself for his lastest assault on a world record. 


At 5-feet-3 and 110-pounds, Musyoki, a 22-year-old native of Kenya, is a 
diminutive man with decided goals. 


Sunday, like the Sunday before, Musyoki's aim was to run a world best, this 
time to better Alberto Salazar's eight-kilometer record of 22 minutes 7 
seconds, which has stood for eight years. 


He did not come close, missing the record by nearly 50 seconds. Although 
Musyoki won -- gaining $1,000 and an all-expense-paid trip for two to Paris -- 
his time of 22:56 was also not fast enough to break the 22:46 course record set 
by Tracey Garrison. 


"I was not tired, but when you run alone in front, you need some help," said 
Musyoki, a resident of Walnut. 


The help he received was merely temporary. At the gun, Musyoki quickly took the 
lead, with several runners funneling in behind his smooth, fluid stride. But 
after the first 200 yards, only one man, Francisco Pacheco of Mexico City, was 
in contact. 


"At the start, I didn't know Musyoki was here," said Pacheco, speaking through 
an interpreter. "But when I saw him in line, I figured, 'No big deal.' I've run 
with better guys." 


Pacheco, 27, and a member of the Mexican national team, took the lead for a few 
strides, then, letting Musyoki take over, dropped a stride behind and let the 
Kenyan set the pace. Together, 50 yards ahead of the pack, they passed the 
first mile in 4:24 -- the pace for a 22:00 8K. 


Pacheco, trying to keep as close to Musyoki as possible to have better 
protection from the light winds, almost clipped the leader's heels at one 
point. Musyoki countered with a few quick zigzags and a surge, leaving Pacheco 
10 yards behind. 


Musyoki quickly extended his lead, though his time at two miles (8:57, eight 
seconds ahead of Pacheco) was about five seconds slower than world-record pace. 
From there, Musyoki tried to maintain, but after passing the four-mile mark in 
18:25 -- about 25 seconds slower than he had hoped -- he knew he would be far 
short of a world record. 


"The fourth mile (time), when I saw it I just said, 'Oh, I wouldn't get the 
record,' I said just go for the win." 


Pacheco made a chase of it, however. After trailing by nearly 13 seconds, he 
closed in to within striking distance. But in the last mile, Musyoki, who never 
looked back, slightly picked up his pace and sprinted to the finish. 


Pacheco earned $800 for second (23:07), and Tim Gruber of San Jose received 
$400 for third (23:28). 


Musyoki, who has run a race each of the last five weekends, said he is 
considering cutting back his race schedule. 


"I race (a lot) because everybody wants me to race; I don't want to disappoint 
them," he said. "But nowadays, I know I've been racing too much. My body tells 
me this. I think I need to test a new (training) formula. The one I'm using now 
is not working very good." 


Asked if he still felt he could break a world record, he said, "Why not? If 
anyone else can break it, why not me?" 


In the women's division, 34-year-old Michele Hopper Buchicchio of Glendora 
outlasted Leslie Lewis, also 34, in winning in 26:50. She also earned $1,000 
and a trip for two to Paris. 


In winning her first race since having a baby 17 months ago, Buchicchio cruised 
the first mile in 5:08 with Lewis and UC Irvine All-American Beth McGrann at 
her side. As McGrann dropped back, Lewis and Buchicchio ran together until the 
3 1/2-mile point, where Buchicchio surged, leaving Lewis behind. 


Lewis (27:10) finished second for $800, though McGrann almost caught her but 
had to settle for third (27:11) and $400. 


Race Notes: 


More than $12,000 was raised Saturday night in hopes of giving William Musyoki 
-- or any other capable runner -- more incentive to break the world record. Had 
a world record been set, the record setter would have split the $12,000 with a 
designated charity. Said Musyoki: "Yes, when I heard that, I said, 'Ooooooh." 
Honorary race chairman and former pole vaulter Bob Seagren announced that the 
goal for next year is to raise $100,000 for a world-record bonus/charity 
donation to attract more world-class runners. . . . A total of 4,120 registered 
runners, including about 165 U.S. Marines running in formation, finished the 
8K. . . . Ray Stewart of Downey won the wheelchair division in 18:50, and John 
Morgan, a blind runner who races with a guide, finished in 32:51.

HORSE RACING ROUNDUP; 


HORLICKS BREAKS HAWKSTER MARK IN JAPAN 




From Associated Press 




Horlicks, a New Zealand mare ridden by Lance O'Sullivan, won the Japan Cup in 
Tokyo by a head Sunday in world record time for 1 1/2 miles on turf after 
running neck-and-neck with Japan's Oguri Cap down the stretch. 


Horlicks' time of 2 minutes, 22 1/5 seconds broke the world record of 2:22 4/5 
set by Hawkster at Santa Anita this year. Hawkster, ridden by Russell Baze, 
finished fifth in the Japan Cup, Japan's only internationalrace. 


The 6-year-old Horlicks earned $956,000, the world's second richest prize 
behind the $1.35 million awarded to the winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic. 


The world's richest race is the Breeders' Cup Classic, which offers $1.35 
million to the winner, the Japan Horseracing Association said. 


"Horlicks started fast from the beginning, so I expected her to set a record 
time," O'Sullivan said. 


At the start, Britain's Ibn Bay led a pack of seven foreign and eight Japanese 
horses, with Hawkster in second spot before 140,000 spectators at the Tokyo 
Horse Race Course, outside the capital. 


In the stretch, however, Horlicks and Oguri Cap surged from the pack and dueled 
to the wire. 


Oguri Cap, ridden by Katsumi Minai, finished second and Pay the Butler of the 
United States, seeking his second straight Japan Cup victory, was third, three 
lengths behind Oguri Cap. 


Fourth was Japan's Super Creek, with popular jockey Yutaka Take aboard. 


Sir Richard Lewis, the odds-on choice, beat Fifteen Gold Stars by a neck in the 
$200,000 New York Stallion Stakes for 2-year-olds at Aqueduct. 


Sir Richard Lewis, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr. and carrying top weight of 119 
pounds, won for the third time in six starts this year. He covered a mile on 
the fast track in 1:39 2/5 to earn $120,000 for Regents Farms. 


Fifteen Gold Stars, 113 pounds and Jose Santos, was next in the field of five. 
5 1/4 lengths ahead of Skate's Honor, 113 pounds and Jerry Bailey. Coach Freddy 
and Talc's Reward followed. 


Sir Richard Lewis paid $3.00 to win, $2.10 to place and $2.10 to show. Fifteen 
Gold Stars paid $2.20 and $2.10 and Skate's Honor paid $2.10 to show.

FOR THE RECORD 


Horse racing -- Horlicks, the New Zealand mare who won the Japan Cup Sunday, 
set a world record for 2,400 meters with her time of 2 minutes 22 1/5 seconds, 
not for 1 1/2 miles as was reported in Monday's editions. The distance she ran 
is about 15 yards short of 1 1/2 miles.

RUNNING: WITH OLYMPICS IN SIGHT, HER DEDICATION SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR 




By Barbie Ludovise 




Unlike many world-class athletes, Joan Hansen has never felt the need to commit 
seemingly endless years of her life in pursuit of glory. 


Train rigorously for years without a break? 


No way. 


Get psyched for races years in advance? 


Not hardly. 


Instead, Hansen, 31, and a 1984 Olympian, seems to reach her athletic potential 
in spurts. Intentionally. 


"I don't have that kind of personality where I say, 'Oh my God, I've got to get 
out and train!' " Hansen said. 


"I wouldn't ever describe myself as a fanatic. I can focus well on anything I 
do . . . but I do not want that focus to become overly unhealthy or overly 
obsessive. I like to tread that fine line between obsession and hobby." 


And right now, running is once again becoming less of a hobby. 


After nearly a year off from training -- and several years removed from her 
best performances -- Hansen, a Los Alamitos resident, started again last 
October. She has dedicated herself to regaining the world-class form that 
helped her set an indoor world record in the two-mile in 1982, and make the 
Olympic team in '84. 


"It takes something pretty big to keep her motivated, but if it's the Olympics, 
Joan gets pretty excited about that," said Robert Vaughn, coach of a 
Dallas-based club who has worked on and off with Hansen for the past six years. 


"It will not be easy. But if you're talented, things can happen," he said. 
"Joan's very, very talented." 


Unfortunately for Hansen, she didn't get to prove her talent when she most 
wanted, in the 1984 Games. 


Running in the women's 3,000-meters -- the race most remember only for the Mary 
Decker-Zola Budd tangle -- Hansen also suffered a fall just less than half-way 
through the race when she tripped on the heels of Portugal's Aurora Cunha. 


Unlike Decker, Hansen got up and continued running. Although she was in last 
place when she got up, Hansen passed four runners and finished eighth in the 
field of 12. 


"I saw (Decker) go down and lay on the ground, but my main concern was to keep 
going," Hansen told Times staff writer Curt Holbreich last year. "I knew she 
was down. I hoped she would get back up. I cared about what happened. I could 
relate. But I also knew in the middle of a race, there was no way I could stop 
and help her." 


A proficient swimmer while growing up in Phoenix, Hansen didn't start running 
until her sophomore year at Arizona. Her identical twin, Joy Hansen, also grew 
up a swimmer, but joined the Wildcat cross-country team as a freshman and 
qualified for AIAW nationals in her first race. Joan decided to join her 
sister, and, the next year, walked on to the track and field team. 


"We realized training for one hour on a track every day was better than five 
hours in a pool," Joan said. 


The Hansen twins, petite, blonde and blue-eyed, became a quick and well-known 
success. Joan, a six-time AIAW All-American at Arizona, and Joy, now a 
world-class triathlete, appeared on the cover of Runner's World magazine. The 
cover photo featured the two sitting on opposite shoulders of Steve Scott. 


Joan, the faster twin, qualified for U.S. national teams for five years between 
1981 and '85. In that time she traveled around the world for competition. Of 
the travel, Hansen said she will always be grateful as it gave her an 
appreciation of other countries and other life styles. 


On a 1982 trip to Bucharest, Romania, for the World University Games, Hansen 
remembers going outside of the area reserved for the athletes to find hundreds 
of people picketing the event. 


"I asked what the signs said. I was told the people wanted the games stopped. 
The people were demanding food," Hansen said. "Inside (the athletic area), we 
the athletes were entitled to as much food as we could eat. Outside people were 
starving." 


On another trip, Hansen said she remembers a group of Lebanese athletes playing 
guitar and singing happily while many of the American athletes complained about 
the unfamiliar conditions. 


"We asked why they were so happy and they said for once they could go outside 
and train without fear of being hurt or killed," Hansen said. "In Lebanon, they 
had to train inside their homes because the fighting had gotten too violent 
outside." 


Hansen said it was experiences such as these that helped shape her outlook on 
sports and life. Last year, while living in Coronado, she helped start the San 
Diego Athletes Fund, a nonprofit organization designed to raise money for San 
Diego athletes training for the Olympics. 


Hansen also has been active in volunteering her time to children, giving 
classroom presentations aimed at encouraging development of self-worth and 
self-improvement. 


"When I was young, Olympians seemed special to me," she said. "Now that I'm 
older, I realize that the negative press that some Olympians are attracting 
isn't (good for the sport). . . . I want to show that Olympians can have a 
positive influence, too." 


The Long Run: After finishing second the past two years, Mike McMahan of Laguna 
Beach won his first Orange 24-hour Run last weekend at Fred Kelly Stadium in 
Orange. 


For the past two years, McMahan, a philosophy professor at Saddleback College 
and UC Irvine, had taken the immediate lead in the race, one that always starts 
at 6 p.m. on a Friday and runs non-stop until 6 p.m. Saturday. But in 1987 and 
1988, McMahan faded badly around the 100-mile mark, and was passed both years 
by eventual winner Leo Marquez of Bakersfield. Marquez set the event record 
last year with 137 1/2 miles. 


But this year, McMahan, 41, maintained his lead through the entire 24 hours, 
finishing with 132 1/4 miles, or 51/4 miles further than his previous best. 


Tom Terry, 44, of Culver City was second with 128 1/4 miles, and Marquez, 50, 
was third with 115. And Erma Hutton of Pasadena (fourth overall with 108 3/4) 
and Meg Slavin of Irvine (sixth with 104) became the first women in seven years 
to break the 100-mile mark at the Orange race. 


Twenty-six runners started the 100-mile run, though, according to race director 
Don Pycior, "Some hit 50 miles and said, 'OK . . . that's it.' " 


Other highlights? "Well, one guy went 40 miles juggling three tennis balls," 
Pycior said. "But he was just one of those kind of guys who sign up at the last 
second." 


Forty miles of juggling? An impulse decision?

RECORD TIMES LEAD TO BOSTON; 


KRISTIANSEN AIMING AT 2:20 MARATHON BARRIER 




From Associated Press 




BOSTON 




Breaking the 2-hour, 20-minute barrier in the marathon has been an obsession 
with the top women's runners since 1983 when Joan Benoit Samuelson became the 
first to go under 2:25. 


Six years later, the goal is still there, and Monday in the 93rd Boston 
Marathon Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen may finally crack it. 


Kristiansen has been trumpeting her intent for the past four years, after 
setting the women's world best of 2:21:06 in the 1985 London Marathon. 


But she has fallen short each time. 


Now, she appears in the best condition of her career and ready for an all-out 
assault on a sub-2:20 race. 


"I feel I'm fit. But, I'm not thinking about 2:20 this time," she said. "This 
time, I have come to Boston trying to win the race. I will try to run as fast 
as possible and hope it will be my best time. 


"If the weather conditions are nice on Monday, I will try. It is not enough for 
me to beat Joan Benoit. I want to go for 2:20 and the world record. I wouldn't 
be surprised if I did 2:20 Monday. It's a mental barrier." 


Kristiansen's recent performances indicate that she might easily crash through 
the barrier. 


Last Sunday, she smashed the course record in winning the 10-kilometer 
(6.2-mile) Boston Milk Run in 30:58. And last month, she set the women's world 
best in winning the New Bedford Half-Marathon (13.1 miles) in 1:08:32. 


"Too many people are saying we can't do it because it's too fast for women," 
Kristiansen said about a sub-2:20 marathon. "But people also said that about 
2:30 and 2:25. 


"So it would be very significant if I broke it." 


The significance of a sub-2:20 marathon would be similar to Roger Bannister 
breaking the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954. It would also continue to close 
the gap between men and women marathoners. 


In 1970, there was more than a 54-minute difference between the best men's and 
women's marathoners (2:08:34 to 3:02:53). By 1980, the gap had diminished to 
just over 17 minutes (2:08:34 to 2:25:41). 


Now, it is less than 15 minutes (2:06:50 to 2:21:06).

BARNES (75-9 1/2) NEARLY SETS RECORD AGAIN; 


TRACK AND FIELD: SHOTPUTTER'S EFFORT AT JENNER MEET IS SECOND ONLY TO HIS 75-10 
1/4 THROW THE PREVIOUS WEEKEND. 




By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




SAN JOSE 




There were no balloons bordering the shotput area, and there wasn't as much 
pre-meet hype in regard to a possible world record. 


Nonetheless, Randy Barnes came ever so close to breaking the world record of 75 
feet 10 1/4 inches that he set last Sunday at UCLA. 


He had only one fair throw out of six Saturday at the Bruce Jenner Invitational 
meet at San Jose City College. However, it was a quite an effort -- 75-9 1/2, 
the second best mark of all time. 


The throw broke the listed world record of 75-8, set by East Germany's Ulf 
Timmermann in 1988. 


So Barnes has made the two best throws of all time in less than a week. 


Barnes said he was emotionally drained from last Sunday's meet. 


"I was strung out after the record and I had to do some traveling," he said. 
"Also, I wasn't as isolated this week as I was last week. 


"I wasn't as sure of myself in the ring and I was little out of control. I'm 
not excited about my consistency, but the bottom line is that I got that throw 
and I'm really excited about that." 


Barnes' big throw came on his second appearance in the ring, as it did in last 
Sunday's meet. 


"I saw the chalk kick up, and I knew it was close (to a record), but I wasn't 
convinced," Barnes said. 


Barnes, 23, then fouled on his remaining throws. 


Barnes said he had a low-key training week and didn't have any "bombs" like his 
79-2 1/2 practice throw the previous week. 


"I'm just tired emotionally from last week," he said. "As much as I tried to, 
it's impossible not to get caught up with every thing." 


Last Sunday, Barnes averaged 73-10 3/4 on his six throws without a foul, the 
best series ever. Actually, his average was better Saturday since he had only 
one fair throw. 


He said he visualizes his throws before he steps into the ring. "But there was 
a blank spot on my tape when I was throwing today," he said, referring to his 
fouls. 


In the high jump, Hollis Conway came close to breaking his American record of 7 
feet 10 inches. 


After Conway cleared 7-8, he had the bar raised to 7-10 1/2. He barely brushed 
the bar on his second attempt. 


"The 7-8 jump was perfect," said Conway, the silver medalist in the 1988 
Olympic Games in Seoul. "And, at 7-10 1/2, I was trying to relive my jump at 
7-8." 


Conway said he's not as ready as he wants to be technically, but he's not 
concerned. 


"I'm going to jump eight feet," he said. "Last year I was just hoping to do 
it." 


Cuba's Javier Sotomayor is the world record-holder at eight feet even. 


Joe Falcon, who won the mile last Sunday at UCLA, easily won the 1,500 meters. 


He sprinted away from the field in the final 500 meters and was easing up at 
the finish line. His time was 3 minutes 38.95 seconds, equivalent to a 3:56 
mile. 


Steve Scott, the U.S. mile record-holder, lagged in eighth place. 


"There's something wrong with me physically," Scott said. "I'm not sure what it 
is, but I've been fatigued all week." 


Scott, 34, has been America's premier miler for virtually the past 13 years. 


Falcon, 23, the former Arkansas star, was asked if he's now replacing Scott in 
that designation. 


"It was not the end of an era. I was just fortunate to beat him," Falcon said. 
"He has everything to lose, and I have nothing to lose." 


Scott was more competitive in finishing second to Falcon last Sunday at UCLA. 


"Joe's in great shape and he's going to be tough to beat," Scott said. 


Falcon said his goal is to run a 3:48 mile and then move to the 5,000 meters. 
Scott's U.S. record is 3:47.69. 


Track Notes 


Six Cuban athletes expected to compete, notably Javier Sotomayor and Ana 
Quirot, did not. They were reportedly denied U.S. entry visas four times in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. When the visas were finally approved Friday, the Cubans had 
already left Sao Paulo and were on their way to a meet in Madrid. Quirot was 
top ranked in the women's 400 and 800 meters in 1989. . . . In one of the most 
competitive races of the day, Doug Padilla out-kicked Algeria's Nourredine 
Morceli in the 3,000 meters. Padilla's winning time was 7:59.02, while Morceli 
was timed in 7:59.81. Morceli, who competes for Riverside City College, and 
Padilla sprinted furiously together down the final stretch, but the experienced 
Padilla had the better burst at the end. . . . Svetlana Kitova of the Soviet 
Union won the women's 1,500 meters in the meet-record time of 4:05.96.

TRACK AND FIELD MILLROSE GAMES; 


O'SULLIVAN WINS MILE; COGHLAN IS FIFTH 




By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




NEW YORK 




The sellout crowd of 16,428 rose as one when Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland strode 
to the starting line to run in the Wanamaker Mile at the 83rd Millrose Games 
Friday night at Madison Square Garden. 


"The ovation from the crowd was a wonderful feeling," Coghlan said. "I was 
hoping that it would lift my adrenalin beyond any level it has been since I 
last ran in this race three years ago." 


But age has robbed Coghlan, 37, of the finishing kick that enabled him to 
become the world record holder in the indoor mile. 


Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland won in 3 minutes 59.35 seconds, his third 
consecutive Wanamaker Mile victory. Coghlan finished fifth in 4:01.83. 


"I think it was youth over age, and Marcus had more in his legs than I did in 
mine," Coghlan said. "Perhaps I was a little bit more ambitious than my 
ability. But I still feel I can run a sub-four minute mile at this stage of my 
career." 


Coghlan, known as the Chairman of the Boards after winning the Wanamaker Mile 
seven times, was boxed in and couldn't fight his way out. 


"Throughout the race there were a number of times where it turned out to be a 
boxing match," Coghlan said. "That disrupted my concentration a little bit." 


O'Sullivan maintained his concentration throughout the race, turning in 
quarter-mile splits of 59.8 seconds, 62.4, 60.9 and 56.1. 


Why is O'Sullivan running so well? 


"Because he's an Irishman like me," Coghlan quipped. "Perhaps what inspires 
Marcus is the fact that I've achieved what I've achieved indoors. In Ireland we 
have heros to look up to. I think that young kids in the United States don't 
have enough heros to look up to." 


O'Sullivan said Coghlan's presence in the race inspired him. 


"I had been finding it really hard to get up this winter," O'Sullivan said. 
"Psychologically, I think I overworked myself last summer. I didn't feel as 
committed as I did in the past. 


"The moment I heard that (Coghlan had decided to switch from the 3,000 meters 
to the mile), my blood started flowing. It was a nice feeling to have him in 
the race because it got my motivation going." 


The 55-meter high hurdles, which featured seven of the top 10 hurdlers in the 
world, developed into a race of attrition before former UCLA star Greg Foster 
prevailed. 


Roger Kingdom, two-time Olympic 110-meter high hurdles champion, failed to 
qualify for the finals after he finished third in his heat. 


Although Kingdom was unable to train because of a bout with the flu, he refused 
to use his illness as an excuse. 


"I'm not going to blame it on anything," Kingdom said. "I just ran bad. My time 
was off because of not working out in a while because of the flu. But you have 
to overcome those things and fight back from all adversity." 


Renaldo Nehemiah, the world indoor record-holder, made the final but tripped 
over the first hurdle and failed to finish. 


"I got severe cramps the third or fourth stride out," Nehemiah said. "I kept 
trying to run through it, but it got progressively worse. I knew it would take 
an act of God for me to get over that first hurdle." 


Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic and world champion in the long jump and 
heptathlon, didn't fare as well as she might have either. 


Making her 1990 indoor debut, Joyner-Kersee finished second in the women's 
55-meter hurdles behind former Tennessee star LaVonna Martin. Martin (7.41) 
outkicked Joyner-Kersee (7.47). 


Joyner-Kersee said she lost sight of Martin because she was focused on beating 
Kim McKenzie and Lynda Tolbert. 


"I'm not disappointed, it's a long season," Joyner-Kersee said. "Last year I 
ran fast early, but this year I want to be ready for June and July." 


The men's 600 meters was the closest race of the meet as Butch Reynolds edged 
Danny Harris in a photo finish. Reynolds was timed in 1:09.22 and Harris in 
1:09.27. 


Notes 


Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High won the boys' high school mile with a time of 
4:14.52, beating Martin Keino of Fork Union, Va. (4.16.63). Keino's father Kip, 
a two-time Olympic gold medalist from Kenya, finished last in the masters mile 
with a time of 5:05.04. It was the first time that a father and son had run in 
the Millrose Games. . . . Leroy Burrell of Houston set a meet record of 6.11 
seconds in the men's 55-meter dash. Burrell said he has benefited from training 
with Carl Lewis. "Training with Carl is almost like having an instant success 
pill," Burrell said. . . . Doug Padilla won the 3,000 in a meet record time of 
7:44.74 and Tyrone Kemp of Florida also set a meet record of 46.85 seconds in 
the 400.

MEADOWLANDS INVITATIONAL TRACK MEET; 


O'SULLIVAN WINS MILE, SETS 1,500 RECORD, TOO 




By AP 




EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 




Marcus O'Sullivan set a world indoor record in the men's 1,500 meters en route 
to winning the mile Friday night in the Meadowlands Invitational, while Said 
Aouita and Paula Ivan barely missed world records in scoring sensational 
victories. 


O'Sullivan, who was chasing fellow Irishman Eamonn Coghlan's indoor mile record 
of 3:49.78 set on the Meadowlands track in 1983, was timed in 3:51.66, the 
fifth-fastest ever. 


But his 1,500-meter time of 3:35.6 broke the accepted world record of 3:36.03, 
set by Spain's Jose-Luis Gonzalez in 1986. 


Aouita, who had said the men's 3,000-meter world record was soft, produced the 
second-fastest clocking ever, 7:39.71, falling short of the mark of 7:39.2, set 
by Emiel Puttemans of Belgium in 1973. 


Aouita, who disdained a mile showdown with O'Sullivan in hopes of setting a 
3,000 record, had to withstand a furious finish by Steve Scott. Scott, the 
American indoor and outdoor mile record-holder, broke the U.S. record of 
7:41.57, finishing second in 7:39.94. 


The American record had been set last year on the fast 10-laps-to-the-mile 
Meadowlands track by Brian Abshire. 


Joe Falcon of Arkansas, who finished sixth in 7:46.42, broke the collegiate 
record of 7:48.1, set by Canadian Graeme Fell of San Diego State in 1972. 


Ivan, the Romanian who won the Olympic gold medal at 1,500 meters last year and 
the silver medal in the 3,000, took the women's mile in 4:18.99, the 
second-fastest ever, behind the 4:18.86 set by her compatriot, Doina Melinte, 
on this track last year. 


Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who just missed equaling the world indoor best in her 
semifinal heat, overcame a slow start and won the women's 55-meter high 
hurdles. 


Joyner-Kersee, the 1988 Olympic champion in the women's long jump and the 
heptathlon, had set her goals this year on setting records in the indoor 
hurdles and the outdoor high hurdles and intermediate hurdles. 


She nearly got the mark in the preliminaries, clocking 7.38 seconds -- only .01 
of a second off the world best of 7.37 which she had run twice last week at New 
York. The 7.38 broke the meet record of 7.45 set by Joyner-Kersee in 1987. 


But after the preliminary, she required treatment for an injured right 
quadriceps. In the final, she appeared to be tentative out of the blocks and 
had to work hard in winning in 7.40, holding off a strong bid by Kim McKenzie. 


McKenzie, the 1984 Olympic bronze medalist in the 100-meter hurdles, finished 
second in 7.42. 


Meanwhile, Gwen Torrence, a 1988 Olympic finalist in the women's 100-meter and 
200-meter dashes, streaked to her 48th consecutive indoor victory since 1986, 
including 24 finals, winning the women's 55-meter dash in 6.65. 


Jack Pierce, who worked in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino before quitting this 
week to devote full time to track, won the 55-meter hurdles in 7.04. Tonie 
Campbell, the Olympic bronze medalist finished second in 7.10, and his Olympic 
teammate, Arthur Blake, was third in 7.12. 


Another meet record was broken in the women's 800 as Melinte, the 1984 Olympic 
champion, swept past Joetta Clark with one lap remaining and won in 2:00.70. 
Clark , who set the meet record of 2:02.15 in 1987, finished second in 2:00.98. 


Diane Dixon led all the way in winning the women's 400 for the sixth time, 
equaling the most victories by any runner in this meet. Dixon, leading all the 
way, was timed in 53.51. 


Joe Dial won the pole vault competition at 19-0 1/4. He then missed three times 
at an American-record 19-5 3/4. 


In two races featuring some old-timers, all past 40, Mike Boit of Kenya broke 
the world indoor Masters mile mark, clocking 4:15.48, and Lee Evans, the former 
world record-holder for 400 meters, broke the world Masters best at that 
distance, with a time of 51.60. 


Boit, 40, the 1972 Olympic bronze medalist at 800 meters, erased the week-old 
mark of 4:17.88, set by Ron Bell of Britain. In that race, Boit was suffering 
from the flu and had no kick, placing second to Bell. 


Evans, 41, easily broke the world Masters mark of 53.9, set by Thane Baker in 
1976.

TRACK AND FIELD; 


MILE, 1,500 MARKS FALL TO MELINTE 




From Associated Press 




EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 




Romanian Doina Melinte smashed world indoor records in the women's 1,500 meters 
and the mile, but Britain's Peter Elliott fell just short in his attempt to 
break those marks in men's events Friday night in the Meadowlands Invitational 
track and field meet. 


Melinte, 33, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist at 800 meters and the silver 
medalist in the 1,500, ran the second half of the mile almost by herself after 
Brit Lind-Peterson of Canada dropped out after setting the pace for about 800 
meters. 


Melinte, intent on earning the $100,000 that was being awarded to any runner 
breaking the world record in the mile, finished in 4 minutes 17.13 seconds. She 
was clocked in 4:00.27 for 1,500 meters. 


Melinte had held the mile record of 4:18.86, set in 1988 on the fast, 
10-laps-to-the-mile Meadowlands track. The previous record for the 1,500 was 
4:00.8, set by Mary Decker Slaney of the United States in 1980 at Madison 
Square Garden in New York. 


"I expect to keep the money," Melinte said. "The best thing about (the 
Romanian) revolution is that now I can keep all the money." 


Elliott, coming off a brilliant victory in the 1,500 meters at the Commonwealth 
Games in Auckland, New Zealand, last week, thought he had a shot at Eamonn 
Coghlan's indoor record of 3:49.78 and the $100,000 bonus that was on the line. 
But he couldn't maintain a fast early pace and finished in 3:52.02, breaking 
the British indoor record of 3:53.70 he set in finishing second to Ireland's 
Marcus O'Sullivan in the 1988 Meadowlands mile. 


Also, two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom won for the first time in the 
indoor track and field season, and double Olympic gold medalist Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee suffered her third consecutive loss, falling to LaVonna Martin in 
the women's 55 hurdles. 


The 400-meter world record-holder Butch Reynolds was declared the winner of the 
600-yard race after first-place finisher Danny Harris was disqualified for 
knocking down Antonio McKay.

BEATTY AND DUMAS CHOSEN FOR TRACK AND FIELD HONOR; 


HALL OF FAME: DORIS BROWN HERITAGE AND RICK WOHLHUTER ALSO WILL BE INDUCTED AT 
SEATTLE CONVENTION OF ATHLETICS CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER. 




From Associated Press 




INDIANAPOLIS 




Jim Beatty, the first man to break the 4-minute mile indoors, and Charles 
Dumas, the first to high-jump 7 feet, are among four new members of the 
National Track and Field Hall of Fame. 


The others, announced today, are Doris Brown Heritage, winner of 14 U.S. 
distance titles and five world cross-country events, and Rick Wohlhuter, a 
two-time Olympian and former world record-holder at 880 yards and 1,000 meters. 


They will be inducted Nov. 30 in Seattle during the annual convention of The 
Athletics Congress, national governing body for track and field. 


Beatty was the highest vote-getter with 286 out of 406 ballots cast by members 
of the track and field community and the news media. He first broke the 
4-minute barrier indoors with a time of 3:58.9 in 1962 at Los Angeles. 


The former University of North Carolina runner also set American records in 
five events that summer and became the first American to hold records 
simultaneously in all events from 1,500 to 5,000 meters. 


Beatty, 55, now living in Charlotte, N.C., served in the state legislature but 
was defeated in a bid for the U.S. House in 1972. 


Dumas cleared 7 feet, 1/2 inch, at the 1956 Olympic Trials and won a gold medal 
later that year at Melbourne. He was sixth in the 1960 Olympics in Rome. 


From 1955 to '59 Dumas won or shared five straight national high jump titles 
and was ranked first in the world twice in that span. 


Dumas, 53, now lives in Inglewood, Calif. He was second in voting for the Hall 
of Fame with 263 votes. 


Heritage first came into prominence in 1967 when she won the first of five 
straight world cross-country titles and represented the United States on nine 
world cross-country teams. She also was on two Olympic squads and placed fifth 
at 800 meters in 1968. 


In all, she won 14 national titles and set a world record at 3,000 meters in 
1971. 


Wohlhuter, a Notre Dame graduate, was the top American half-miler of the 
mid-1970s. 


He broke the U.S. record for 800 meters twice, set world records for the 
880-yard run twice and added a world record for the 1,000 meters in 1974.

Calvin Smith spoiled Carl Lewis' 28th birthday by defeating the Olympic 
champion in the 100 meters, and Abdi Bile ended Steve Cram's Dream Mile winning 
streak at the Bislett Games in Oslo. 


Smith, a former world record-holder and bronze medalist in the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics, won in 10.05 seconds. That broke the Bislett Stadium record of 10.19 
that Lewis set eight years ago. Lewis, running the 100 for only the third time 
this season, was second in 10.11. 


Bile, the Somalian who won the 1,500 in the 1987 World Championships, won in 
3:49.90 with a kick in the last 50 meters. Cram, who started his streak in 1985 
when he set the world record of 3:46.32, was fourth in 3:51.58. 


Ingrid Kristiansen posted the third-fastest time ever in the women's 10,000. 
The Norwegian, who set world records here in 1985 and 1986, was clocked in 
30:48.51, almost 35 seconds slower than her world mark. 


Other 1989 world bests were in the 800 by Johnny Gray of the United States, 
1:43.39; in the 3,000 by Said Aouita of Morocco, 7:34.79; in the shotput by Ulf 
Timmermann of East Germany, 71 feet 11 1/2 inches, and in the pole vault by 
Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union, 19-4 1/2.

CLAYTON STARTLES THE FIELD AT BARRIOS 10K RACE 




By BARBIE LUDOVISE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




SANTA ANA 




Matt Clayton doesn't have any national championships notched on his running 
shoes. There are no Olympic medals gathering dust on his shelf. 


But Sunday at the $20,000 Reebok Arturo Barrios Invitational, Clayton, a 
24-year-old San Diego State student, raced against those who have such things 
-- and won nonetheless. 


Clayton, of Imperial Beach, waited until the final 200 yards of the 
10-kilometer race to pull away from a talented field to win in 28 minutes 30 
seconds, an impressive 39-second improvement over his previous 10K best of 
29:09, run only two weeks ago. 


Among those Clayton beat were Suleiman Nyambui, who won 15 National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. championships in cross-country, indoor and outdoor track 
competing for UTEP in the early 1980s. 


Nyambui, 37, was second in 28:39, followed by Mexican standouts Salvador Garcia 
(28:44), Abundio Mondragon (28:52) and Jorge Marquez (29:12). 


"Oh, this is a big-time thrill for me," said Clayton, a cross-country coach at 
Bonita Vista High School. "My main goal was to run under 29 minutes and break 
into the top five. I didn't think I'd win the thing. It's exciting. Like (being 
on) cloud 99, I guess." 


In the women's division, Rosa Mota, the 1988 Olympic marathon champion from 
Portugal, had little trouble outrunning a field that included four-time U.S. 
Olympian Francie Larrieu-Smith, 1987 NCAA 10,000-meter champ Sylvia Mosqueda, 
and Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, the women's world-record holder at several 
distances, including 10K. 


Mota, who waved to the largely Latino crowds as they shouted "Vaya Rosa!" and 
"Vaya Rosita!," spent the first two miles in a shoulder-to-shoulder duel with 
Mosqueda before picking up the pace. Mosqueda, whose reputation as a runner who 
goes out hard and finishes weak proved true again, faded to third in 33:20 and 
was passed by Larrieu-Smith (second at 33:05) with two miles remaining. 


Mota, who is just 4-feet-9, 90 pounds and wears a men's size 3 1/2 shoe, said: 
"I don't like to wait for the finish (to make a move) because I am too slow. I 
try to go faster and faster each mile instead." 


Kristiansen, still recovering from her victory in the New York City Marathon 
three weeks ago, participated in the event's 5K walk with her 6-year-old son, 
Gaute, before running in the elite 10K. Kristiansen had planned on running in 
the open 10K, but changed her mind Saturday. 


"I planned to run the fun run, but I am a competitor; I wanted to run," she 
said. "I didn't try to win at all; I just love to race. I haven't trained since 
New York, so I'm not in shape." 


Kristiansen, whose 10K world record on the track is 30:13, ran 34:24, good 
enough for sixth and $400. 


Clayton and Mota each earned $4,000 for their victories. 


Notes 


Although he is hardly close to his form that brought him several world records 
some 10 years ago, 37-year-old Henry Rono, now on the comeback trail in Eugene, 
Ore., ran a respectable 32:34 for 19th. . . . Twelve men broke 30 minutes in 
the race, and seven women ran sub-35s. . . . Orange County's top finisher was 
former Orange Coast College standout Alfredo Vigueras, now living and training 
in Alamosa, Colo. . . . Proceeds from the race will benefit a "Stay in School" 
program for Orange County students. The race's namesake, Arturo Barrios, said 
$15,000 was raised for the program Sunday. Next year the goal is $20,000. "This 
sport has given me a lot of things," said Barrios, the world-record holder at 
10,000 meters. "This is one way of giving something back, to help people." . . 
. Despite the early-morning drizzle, about 2,000 runners turned out for the 
races, and an estimated 1,000 came just to watch.

WHEN AFRICANS WITHER, BORDIN WINS IN BOSTON 




By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




BOSTON 




It is by now a familiar sight: the start of a marathon, one of sport's most 
grueling trials, and runners from Africa shoot off the line, sprinting, with 26 
miles to the finish. 


It is a style uniquely African, and one that has proved ultimately successful. 
The world record-holder, Belayneh Dinsamo of Ethiopia, grinds down his 
opposition in this manner. 


Thus, when eight African runners started Monday's 94th Boston Marathon at a 
shocking pace, there was little surprise. That the pace was not maintained was 
no surprise, either. Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania led the race to a halfway time of 
1 hour 2 minutes 1 second, an improbable 2:04 pace. 


Gelindo Bordin of Italy has seen it before, too. The Olympic champion resisted 
the urge to go with the leaders and, after their energy or legs failed them, 
Bordin patiently moved up, utilizing the fast pace to win in 2:08:19, a 
personal best and an Italian record. The world record is 2:06:50. 


The stampede at the start was an impressive sight on a warm, sunny Patriots 
Day, with more than a million spectators lining the streets to watch this 
annual spectacle. 


"It never ceases to amaze me the aggressiveness and the abandon with which the 
Africans attack a marathon," said Rob de Castella of Australia, who won here in 
1986. He placed fifth Monday. "They just go as hard as they can and keep on 
going as long as they can. It's inspirational." 


The women's race had no such wild abandon. Prerace favorite Rosa Mota of 
Portugal won in 2:25:24. Uta Pippig, who fled East Germany just before the fall 
of the Berlin Wall, was second in 2:28:03, and Maria Trujillo of Phoenix was 
third in 2:28:53. Kim Jones of Seattle, ranked No. 3 in the world, was fourth 
in 2:31:01. 


John Campbell of New Zealand set a world master's record in placing fourth in 
2:11:04. Campbell, 42, bettered Jack Foster's record of 2:11:19. Mustapha Badid 
of France won the men's wheelchair race in 1:29:53 and Jean Driscoll from 
Champaign, Ill., won the women's wheelchair race in 1:43:17. 


Bordin and Mota each won $50,000, and Mota became Boston's first female 
three-time winner. 


Ikangaa, 29, has a history of finishing second in big races. In 1988, he was 
passed by Ibrahim Hussein in the last steps of this race: Hussein won by one 
second. Ikangaa was the runner-up here last year, losing to Abebe Mekonnen of 
Ethiopia. Mekonnen also beat him by 11 seconds in Tokyo in 1988, and Ikangaa 
was beaten by three seconds in Fukuoka in 1983. 


Asked the obvious question about placing second here for the third year in a 
row, Ikangaa paused then said: "Yes, it is very disappointing. But I will keep 
trying until I win." 


Bordin and the rest of the field watched in amazement as a pack of nine 
runners, including Salvador Garcia of Mexico, bolted from the start, covering 
the first mile in 4:26. 


The usually effusive Bordin had this simple assessment of the strategy: "Those 
guys were crazy." 


Perhaps, but Bordin went with the leaders for the first few miles, while de 
Castella headed up the distant second group, a more sensible group he would 
later say. 


"I knew they were running fast, because I was running fast and they were out of 
sight," de Castella said. 


The lead pack was, for most of the race, an all-African group. In fact, it was 
an all-Rift Valley group, with two runners each from Tanzania, Kenya and 
Ethiopia. Ikangaa moved into the lead at four miles, and the group settled into 
an easy rhythm, passing water and sponges among themselves and, despite the 
torrid pace, looking comfortable and in control. 


The group was more than a minute under world-record pace early and showed no 
sign of breaking up. In the group were these surprises: Kip Kimeli of Kenya, 
the 1988 Olympic 10,000 meter champion; Tesfaye Tafa of Ethiopia, running in 
his first marathon, and Simon Robert Naali of Tanzania, a once-lightly regarded 
runner who placed third at the Commonwealth Games in January. 


By 10 miles, Naali dropped off the pace. Of those in the lead group, only 
Ikangaa and Hussein -- old adversaries in this race -- looked prepared to keep 
the pace as it was. Their half-marathon time of 1:02:1 was one of the fastest 
halfway marks ever. Steve Jones of Wales ran 1:01:42 in Chicago in 1985, but 
most runners say that such a pace frightens them. 


Bordin was hanging back, 46 seconds behind at the midway point, still not 
believing the pace. "I thought, 'This is crazy,' " he said. "I ran too fast the 
first half. If someone would run a 2:04, I would shake his hand. But I really 
thought something would happen." 


It did. Ikangaa first broke off from his pack, but as he gathered himself for 
his own long kick, his body unraveled. 


At 16 miles, Ikangaa made his move, dropping Hussein and pushing the pace for 
two more punishing miles, just to make sure. 


"I wanted to keep that pace," Ikangaa said. "I was thinking of a record. About 
that time, someone held up a sign that said we were on 2:05 pace. I was 
thinking 2:07." 


Such thoughts were short-lived, however. Running alone and squinting into a 
bright sun, Ikangaa had no idea what was unfolding behind him. Hussein and 
Naali dropped out. Bordin was methodically picking off the remnants of that 
first pack and came within sight of Ikangaa. Someone shouted to Ikangaa that 
Bordin was behind him, and both raced up Heartbreak Hill with six miles to go. 


Bordin passed Ikangaa just after they crested the hill. Then it was Ikangaa's 
turn to be left behind. The Tanzanian was unable to go with Bordin, he said, 
because of a cramp in his left calf. At that point, he began to worry about 
being caught for second. 


He never was as he finished in 2:09:52. Rolando Vera of Ecuador, running in his 
first marathon, was third in 2:10:46. 


Mota emerged from an emotional week, culminating in a long-sought agreement 
with the Portuguese federation. The agreement allows her to choose where and 
when she will run, a freedom she has not enjoyed in the past. 


Mota said she was unsure if she could set aside her emotions in time for the 
race. 


"I felt very nervous before the race because I didn't know if I could 
concentrate with everything that has happened," she said. "When I started 
running, I forgot everything and ran a good race. I came here today to win, not 
break my fastest time."

WITHOUT CEREMONY, ELLIOTT IS TAKING OVER; 


TRACK AND FIELD: HE'S THE HEIR APPARENT TO THE BRITISH MIDDLE-DISTANCE 
TRADITION. 




By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




A new decade is the signal for a changing of the guard in the esteemed ranks of 
British middle-distance runners. 


The 1980s belonged to Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram, whose 
accomplishments are part of track and field lore. 


In the '90s, Cram, the world record-holder in the mile, will most likely still 
be a factor, along with a 27-year-old steel mill carpenter who is emerging as 
perhaps the next great British runner. 


Peter Elliott, who will run the mile tonight in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at 
the Forum, has served his apprenticeship and is apparently ready to be 
acclaimed internationally. 


The track and field season has just begun, but Elliott has already won the 
1,500 meters in the Commonwealth Games at Auckland, New Zealand, and made a 
bold bid last Friday to break Eamonn Coghlan's world indoor mile record of 3 
minutes 49.78 seconds in the Meadowlands Invitational at East Rutherford, N.J. 


Elliott didn't do it, but considering that his competition failed to challenge 
him, his time of 3:52.02 was commendable. 


He has had his share of disappointments, beginning with the 1984 Olympics in 
Los Angeles. 


While warming up for the semifinals of the 800 meters, he had to pull out of 
the race with a painful stress fracture in his foot. 


Four years elapsed before Elliott could get a shot at another Olympic medal, 
this time in Seoul. 


"I was running well all season and made the final of the 800," Elliott said. 
"As I was warming up for the final, the muscles around my abdomen seized." 


An injection enabled Elliott to compete, and he finished fourth, missing the 
bronze medal by six-hundredths of a second. 


The trials in the 1,500 were still ahead, and Elliott took a pain-killing shot 
20 minutes before every heat. He was determined to get to the final of the 
1,500, which he did. 


"I thought it would be more painful to watch an Olympic final that I thought I 
could win, especially after pulling out in L.A.," Elliott said. 


Elliott ran second by a stride to Kenya's Peter Rono, who had a time of 3:35.95 
to Elliott's 3:36.15. 


Elliott didn't have to prove anything to himself in the 1988 Olympics, but his 
performance quieted the clamor at home that he shouldn't have represented 
Britain in two races. 


The background: 


Elliott won the 1,500 in his country's Olympic trials, after previously being 
selected for the 800 because he had run the fastest time in Britain that 
season. 


"The trials were held over only two days, and it was very difficult to run both 
the 800 and 1,500," Elliott said. "Coe just ran the 1,500 and got knocked out 
in a heat." 


Then, a British tabloid ran a cartoon depicting Coe as a thoroughbred, Elliott 
as a cart horse. 


"They were trying to get the public on Seb's side, saying he should have the 
right to defend his Olympic title at 1,500 meters," Elliott said. 


"They really shouldn't have had a go at me because I won the trials at 1,500 
meters. What they should have been doing is having a go at the guy who finished 
second (Steve Crabb), or Steve Cram, who was pre-selected for the 1,500." 


There was also a tabloid phone-in poll that asked, "Who should go, Elliott or 
Coe?" 


"It just stirred up the public," Elliott said, "and I got a lot of hate mail. 
It got totally out of hand." 


The furor died after Elliott's performance in the Olympics. 


"I got a full-page apology from the Daily Mirror," he said. 


Elliott said the British selection system for major competitions has been 
changed. 


Instead of sending the first two finishers in the trials, along with a third to 
be pre-selected, two athletes will be selected on the basis of performances, 
along with the winner of the race in the trials. 


Elliott said he is using the indoor season as a buildup for the outdoor season 
and is pointing to the European Championships in Yugoslavia later in the year. 


"With four or five races indoors, you find out what kind of shape you are in 
and it gives you confidence for the summer," Elliott said. 


Elliott, a resident of Rotherham in South Yorkshire County, works four hours a 
day as a carpenter, his trade since he was 16. 


"Some athletes train in the morning and sit around all afternoon in a hotel 
room," Elliott said. "I couldn't do that every day. When you're injured, you're 
still guaranteed a little money." 


Track and Field Notes 


Doug Padilla will run the two-mile instead of the 3,000 meters tonight in an 
effort to break the world indoor record of 8:13.2 set by Belgium's Emiel 
Puttemans in Berlin in 1973. Padilla is the American record-holder in 8:15.3. . 
. . The meet begins at 6:30 p.m. 


Other accomplished athletes in the meet include milers Marcus O'Sullivan and 
Steve Scott, hurdlers Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Tonie Campbell, quarter-milers 
Antonio McKay and Diane Dixon, sprinter Dawn Sowell and Romanian Doina Melinte, 
the world record-holder in the mile, who will run the 800 meters tonight. . . . 
Danny Everett, former UCLA star who set a world indoor record of 45.04 seconds 
in the 500 meters at Stuttgart, West Germany, will compete at that distance 
tonight. "I didn't go there for a record, just a best performance," Everett 
said.

SECOND IN 10,000 A BRIEF DETOUR FROM TITLES FOR O'NEIL 




By JOHN GEIS 




SAN DIEGO 




Jim O'Neil began the last lap of Friday's 10,000 meters knowing full well he 
was about to relinquish the National Masters 60-64 age-group championship he 
had monopolized the previous four years. 


He was nearly a minute behind front-running Patrick Devine of Los Angeles. 


It wasn't that O'Neil was fading. In fact, the La Jolla resident was still 
going strong, but his 64-year-old legs simply could not keep up with the stride 
of 60-year-old Devine, who led throughout. 


Devine won easily -- as many thought he should, being the young buck in the 
group -- finishing in 37 minutes 24 seconds. But O'Neil, the old man of the 
pack, placed second at 38:22.29, beating several younger competitors. 


Although other runners, race officials and onlookers knew the time gap between 
the two was proportionate to their difference in age, O'Neil would not use that 
as an excuse. 


"He (Devine) was tough today," O'Neil said. "He deserved that win." 


But O'Neil deserved some accolades, too. He was not merely defending his 
four-time title in the event but was keeping alive his string of 22 consecutive 
appearances in the National Masters Championships. 


"Twenty-two straight years," marveled Pico Rivera's Larry Banuelos, the 
10,000-meter winner in the 65-69 age group. "That's phenomenal." 


It is even more phenomenal when one considers that there have been only 22 of 
these meets. O'Neil is the only one to run in all of them. 


"I'll run as long as it's fun," O'Neil said. "My long-range goal is that I want 
to break all running records for the 100-year-old age group." 


Of course, there are no such records -- not yet anyway. But through his 
straight face, it was difficult to gauge whether O'Neil was joking. 


There is also O'Neil's history. He hasn't been getting older -- he has been 
getting stronger. 


Never mind that for the first time in five years, O'Neil failed to win the 
10,000-meter championship. Next year, he'll likely be back on top in the 65-69 
age group. 


"He'll definitely put me away next year," Banuelos said. 


Consider that in his college days at Miami of Florida, where he ran the 
two-mile and was the captain of the track team, his best mark was 10 minutes, 
and that much later, at age 47, he ran a 9:58. 


The difference? 


"I was more disciplined than I was as a youngster," O'Neil said. "I had more 
motivation, plus the training methods are different now. In my college days, if 
a training run was four or five miles, that was a long way. As a Masters 
runner, I go eight or nine miles and think nothing of it." 


That wasn't always the case. When O'Neil first got into the Masters program at 
age 42, he couldn't even complete a mile. 


"At that time, I weighed 25 pounds more than I do now, and I was drinking a 
lot," O'Neil said. "It took me literally a couple of years to get all the 
martinis out of my system." 


It was after he saw a Masters mile at the San Francisco Examiner Games that 
O'Neil decided, "My God, if those guys can do it, I can do it." 


Looking back, he says that decision saved his life. 


"I probably would not be here today if it were not for (Masters track)," he 
said. "It sounds corny, but the truth is it turned my life around. It's like 
someone who smokes -- or drinks, it's the same thing -- it takes something to 
motivate you to stop. And for me, that was running." 


O'Neil's new obsession has allowed him to reap many rewards. He has set "more 
than a dozen world records," but his most cherished achievement came at the age 
of 52 when he and his son, Tom, then 17, established the father-son world 
record for marathons. Jim finished in 2:35:08, an American record for his age 
group, and Tom came in at 2:24:26. 


"It was a thrill to run with him and share the record with him," Jim said. 


It would seem O'Neil has shared his running with more people than just his son. 


"I have a picture of him running," Banuelos said. "A little 8-by-10 that he 
signed a couple years ago. He doesn't know it, but I have that hanging on my 
wall at home."

ETHIOPIAN WALTZES THROUGH BOSTON; 


MEKONNEN WINS IN 2:09:06; KRISTIANSEN FIRST IN 2:24:33 




By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 




BOSTON 




Out of the horn of Africa has emerged the most devastating and dominant group 
of marathon runners the world has seen. 


Or at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation 
and won three consecutive Olympic gold medals, putting its indelible stamp on 
the marathon. It appears to be happening again, a generation after Abebe Bikila 
ran barefoot through the darkened streets of Rome in 1960 to win the first of 
his two Olympic golds. 


Now it is Abebe Mekonnen, who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic 
Marathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero. 


Mekonnen, a police lieutenant from Addis Ababa, made a furious rush with a mile 
to go, passing Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania and winning Monday's Boston Marathon in 
2 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds. Ikangaa was second in 2:09:56. It was only the 
second time an African has won here. 


Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway easily won the women's race in 2:24:33 after 
abandoning her attempt to break 2:20. Kristiansen, the women's marathon world 
record-holder, started fast but slowed markedly on a hot day. With temperatures 
in the high 60s during the Patriot's Day race, it was about 20 degrees warmer 
than it was Sunday and all of last week. 


Still, Kristiansen finished 26th overall, believed to be the highest finish for 
a woman in this race. 


Joan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset 
with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished 
ninth among the women in 2:37:52. It was the worst marathon performance of her 
career. 


It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon. In 
an emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women's 
Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have 
run her last marathon for some time. 


But the story of Monday's 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 
million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon 
running. 


In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons. In Rotterdam on 
Sunday, Belayneh Dinsamo won in 2:08:39. Dinsamo holds the world record of 
2:06:50, set last year on the same course. 


Also on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2. 
Keleke Metaferia won in 2:10:28, and Dereje Nedi was second in 2:10:36. 
Ethiopia beat Italy for the World Cup team title with a second-string team. 


Nearly a dozen Ethiopian runners have been deployed around the world in this 
hectic two-week period of spring marathons. Two other Ethiopians were in 
Monday's Boston race, placing ninth and 18th. And still another, Wodajo Bulti, 
who has run 2:08:44, is one of the favorites in the London Marathon next 
Sunday. 


Ethiopia's legacy to the world in the last decade has been one of drought, 
famine and ethnic civil war. More than 1 million people died in 1984-85 during 
a drought-caused famine. The plight of Ethiopians caught the imagination of the 
world and inspired rock musicians and others to organize benefit concerts. 
Because of internal disturbances, however, little of that aid ever reached the 
needy. 


Politically pro-Soviet, Ethiopia's Marxist government ordered boycotts of the 
Olympic Games in 1976, 1984 and 1988. Had they not boycotted, at least three 
Ethiopian runners would have been among the favorites in the men's marathon at 
Seoul. 


Despite its erratic participation, however, Ethiopia has a proud Olympic 
heritage, dating to 1956. 


One of the marathon's most enduring figures was Bikila, who won the marathon 
gold medal in 1960 and 1964. Ethiopia also took the marathon gold in 1968, when 
Mamo Wolde, 36, won at altitude in Mexico City. 


It is the altitude at which the Ethiopians train that enhances their aerobic 
capacity. Much of the central part of the country is mountainous, ranging in 
altitude from 6,000 to 15,000 feet. 


It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and 
Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it. He was among the pack of four African 
runners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles. At about mile 16, 
Mekonnen and Ikangaa took off, running at first side by side, then with Ikangaa 
holding a slight lead. 


And they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning 
last year's Tokyo Marathon. 


"I know him very well as a runner," Mekonnen said through an interpreter. "I 
knew that I should stay with him until the last (two miles). He's a good 
runner, but he does not have a good finish." 


Mekonnen and Kristiansen each earned $45,000. 


John Treacy of Ireland, who was third behind Ikangaa here last year, was third 
again in 2:10:24. 


"I knew that they had gone out very hard," Treacy said of the blistering early 
pace. Until the halfway point, the men were on a 2:04 pace, dangerous in 
Monday's heat. 


The pace got the best of Saimon Robert Haali of Tanzania, who led the race for 
five miles. He finished sixth. 


The women's race had only one leader, Kristiansen. She, too, set an incredible 
early pace. For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running 
at a 2:17 pace. By the 17th mile, she had added more than 20 seconds to her 
mile splits. 


By her own reckoning, it was at almost 16 miles that Kristiansen felt the heat. 


"I decided to just win the race," she said. "It was too hot to set the world 
record." 


Samuelson held on to second place and even ran comfortably until about 11 
miles, when she came undone. 


"I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn't 
my problem today," Samuelson said. "I felt real easy the first 11 miles, I felt 
I was right in the groove. I was right where I wanted to be. 


"Before I came to Boston, I had a lot of problems with my hip and my back. At 
about 11 miles, it went very quickly. I lost my stride from that point. Lisa 
Weidenbach went flying by me at that point. Marguerite (Buist) went shortly 
thereafter. I kept thinking I'd pull it off. I didn't have the day I really 
wanted. I was duly humbled." 


Samuelson, who had knee surgery in February, continued to fade as her stride 
faltered and was beaten by three U.S. runners. It had been at least eight years 
since Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American. 


Buist, of New Zealand, was second in 2:29:04. Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., was 
third in 2:29:34. Weidenbach was fifth. 


"It's always difficult to be beaten by Americans when you are the American 
champion," Kristiansen said. "The easiest way to be beaten is to drop out of a 
race. And she didn't. I think it's great that she finished." 


Such compliments did little to placate Samuelson. In the postrace news 
conference, the private Samuelson was as emotional as she has ever been in 
public. Her voice broke several times. 


"I've run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in 
me," she said. "A lot of people are expecting me to say this is it. It's not 
it. (But) I have been spending as much time in physical therapy as I have in 
training and I can't continue that. I think I need to take an indefinite rest. 
It could be a year, it could be five years. I just can't go on with my 
responsibilities as a wife and mother and spend this amount of time in physical 
therapy and training. I'll just take a break." 


Samuelson, who holds the U.S. marathon record, said she will significantly 
decrease her training mileage and probably run shorter races. She said she will 
run an eight-kilometer event next month in Washington, D.C. 


"I want everyone to know that it's still there," Samuelson said, tears welling 
in her eyes. "I will run again. I need to get beyond this problem."

NATIONAL TRACK MEET MAKES STOP IN HOMETOWN OF PROGRAM FOUNDER; 


LOOKING FOR A RACE, PAIN BECAME MASTER OF THE MASTERS 




By JOHN GEIS 




SAN DIEGO 




David Pain thought it a shame that athletics were wasted on the young. So in 
1966, the La Jolla attorney did something about it -- he began Masters track 
and field. 


Pain's idea was simple. Allow athletes to compete against others their own age. 
Let 34-year olds run against no one younger than 30, 74-year olds against no 
one younger than 70. 


It was an idea that quickly caught on. Now, 23 years after its birth, Masters 
track and field has hundreds of thousands of competitors worldwide, Pain says. 


Some 1,600 of them are gathered here this week for the TAC/USA National Masters 
Championships, which begin today and run through Sunday at both San Diego State 
and Balboa Stadium. 


"It's the equivalent of rolling 20 track meets into one," said Dixon Farmer, 
the meet director and a former CIF state champion at 440 yards and the 180-yard 
low hurdles in 1958 and 1959. 


And of course, David Pain is right smack in the middle of organizing the 
monstrosity. 


"I've never seen anyone who has such an attention to detail," Farmer said. 


But could anyone expect something less than obsession from the father of 
Masters track? 


Pain was 45 in 1966 and realizing just how difficult it was to juggle a 
lawyer's calendar with a social calendar. 


"I was competing in handball at the San Diego Athletic Club," Pain recalled. "I 
enjoyed the game, but there's always problems with a court game, having to sign 
up for a court, be there at a certain time and only have one hour. As a lawyer 
it was pretty hard to say, 'I'll be there at 4 p.m.' and keep that commitment. 


"So I started running, and the thought occurred to me, 'Why not have a Masters 
mile?' " 


Pain got ahold of Les Land, who at the time organized a track meet here. Land, 
too, asked, "Why not?" He consequently added an over-40 mile to his meet. Pain 
and several others competed. 


"I think I pulled a muscle and pulled up lame in that one," Pain said. "But 
that's part of the game. In athletics, you have injuries." 


It was an inauspicious debut for Pain, who never competed in athletics in 
college or high school. But the injury did not hamper the idea. 


Organizers of the San Francisco Examiner indoor meet, of the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena meet and finally the Millrose Games all asked the Master milers to 
compete. 


"Then I thought, 'Why not have a Masters track meet?' " Pain recalls. 


Though a success with some 400 athletes, the first meet -- held in San Diego -- 
did have some glitches, not the least of which was the fact that only a handful 
of the athletes were women. 


"We had to run all the women in one race because we didn't have enough in each 
age division," Pain said. 


There were also several events -- pole vault, hammer, triple jump and decathlon 
among them -- not included because Pain and others thought older athletes ought 
not attempt them. That was soon regarded as backward thinking. 


"We quickly learned that Master athletes could do all disciplines without 
exceptions," Pain said. 


Pain and his colleagues have been going forward ever since. How far? Well, the 
biggest-ever Masters meet will begin next week when more than 5,000 athletes 
from some 55 different countries descend on Eugene, Ore., for the world 
championships. 


"He just got this idea," said Linda Pain, David's wife, "and it took off." 


"Like the guy who invented the safety pin, or the guy who invented the paper 
clip," David added. 


But for those who participate, Pain's idea added more to life than just 
convenience. 


"The things people write to me makes me think we created something good for 
people," Pain said. 


Perhaps the best indication of that came two years ago at a banquet following 
the world championships in Melbourne, Australia. 


"A gentleman went up to the microphone unannounced," Pain remembered, "and he 
said, 'I want everyone here to know that Dave Pain gave me a rebirth. He gave 
me a new life.' And he said it with such sincerity. There were so many people 
in the room who sort of said amen to that in agreement. It gave me a wonderful 
feeling to know that there were so many people whose life had been made better 
because of this program . . . 


"It gives people a forum in which they can compete regardless of age as long as 
they have a competitive spirit and athletic ability." 


Pain, now 67, still competes in the middle distances. His best year came in 
1971 when, at the age of 50, he ran 800 meters in 2:18.7, not world-class but 
respectable. 


Some of the other athletes who will compete beginning today include: 


 -- Paul Spangler. At 90, Spangler will be the oldest American competing (There 
will be some "guest" Finish athletes competing over that age). Spangler is a 
multi-record holder in the 10,000, 5,000 and "everything down to the 800 
meters," Pain said. 


 -- Payton Jordan. Jordan, who coached at Stanford and the 1968 U.S. Olympic 
team, was a national-class sprinter at USC in 1939 but stopped competing after 
college. Until, that is, he turned 55 and entered the Masters program. At 72, 
Jordan has run the 100 meters in 12.9 seconds (hand timed). 


 -- Derek Turnbull. Turnbull is a 62-year-old sheep-herder from New Zealand who 
two years ago in Melbourne won five gold medals, in the 800, 1,500, 5,000, 
10,000 and marathon. After all the preliminaries and finals in those events, 
and just four hours after finishing the marathon, Turnbull came back for an 
encore and participated in an exhibition mile, finishing in less than five 
minutes. 


 -- James King of San Diego. King, who recently turned 40, set the world record 
in the 35-39 age group in the intermediate hurdles at 52.8. 


"Without Masters," Pain said, "athletes like James King would fade away. But 
now every five years he can look forward to new records and stay interested." 


 -- Stan Whitley. Like King, Whitley is an intermediate hurdler. "He and King 
will be battling it out, and you'll see a new (Masters) world record from one 
of them," Pain promised. 


The meet already has taken a crooked turn. About 60 of 100 flags borrowed from 
Balboa Park's United Nations display were set up along San Diego State's track 
Tuesday afternoon. Sometime that night, they were stolen. 


"Whoever did it had to jump the fence to get in there," said Steve Levon of The 
Athletics Congress. "It wasn't an easy task. They're going to cost between $25 
and $30 apiece to replace, so we'd be happy to take them back, no questions 
asked."
