A deal allowing a private ski resort in Vermont to cross the Appalachian Trail 
was improperly struck, three environmental groups charged in a lawsuit. The 
National Park Service in January approved an easement to let the Killington Ski 
Area cut trees from a 200-foot corridor across a 1.2-mile stretch of the trail 
and cross it twice with ski runs. The park service also waived its right to 
review future development by the resort at Mendon, the Appalachian Trail 
Conference, Sierra Club and Vermont Natural Resources Council said in the U.S. 
District Court suit.

'MOUNTAIN MAN' RECEIVES LIFE TERM FOR KILLING HIKER 




From United Press International 




GETTYSBURG, Pa. 




A "mountain man" who lived in a cave near the Appalachian Trail has been 
sentenced to life in prison for killing a female hiker last year at her 
campsite. 


Stephen Roy Carr, 22, who was convicted in October of the first-degree murder 
of Rebecca Wight, 29, was sentenced Wednesday. Carr shot Wight and another 
hiker, Claudia Brenner, 32, along the Appalachian Trail in Michaux State Forest 
in Franklin Township, Adams County. Brenner survived.

National Forest, Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River, and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land. Virginia
Counties of Botetourt, Roanoke, Craig, Montgomery, Pulaski, Bland, and Giles and the West Virginia Counties of Monroe,
Summers, Mercer, and Wyoming








AGENCY: 



Forest Service, USDA.











ACTION: 



Revised Notice_Revises the publication date for the draft and final environmental impact statements; establishes
the date, time and location of four public meetings; changes the telephone number and address of the USDA Forest Service,
Jefferson National Forest; defines the study area the agencies are using in developing alternatives to the proposed
action; and changes the responsible official for the National Park Service.
















SUMMARY: 



The Forest Service will prepare a draft and final environmental impact statement on a proposed action to authorize
the Appalachian Power Company to construct a 765,000-volt transmission line across approximately twelve miles
of the Jefferson National Forest, as well as portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River (at Bluestone
Lake) and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land (at Guyandotte River).







The federal agencies have identified a study area in which alternatives to the proposed action will be developed.
The study area includes land located in the Virginia counties of Botetourt, Roanoke, Craig, Montgomery, Pulaski,
Bland and Giles and the West Virginia counties of Monroe, Summers, Mercer and Wyoming.



The Appalachian Power Company proposal involves federal land under the administrative jurisdiction of the USDA
Forest Service (Jefferson National Forest), the USDI National Park Service (Appalachian National Scenic Trail)
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (New River and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land).



The Forest Service will be the lead agency and is responsible for the preparation of the environmental impact statement.
The National Park Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be cooperating agencies in accordance with 40 CFR
&sect;1501.6.



In initiating and conducting the analysis the federal agencies are responding to the requirements of their respective
permitting processes and the need for the Appalachian Power Company to cross federal lands with the proposed transmission
line.



The Forest Service additionally will assess how the proposed transmission line conforms to the direction contained
in their Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP). Changes in the LRMP could be required if the transmission line is
authorized across the Jefferson National Forest.



The total length of the electric transmission line proposed by the Appalachian Power Company is approximately 115
miles.



The original notice indicated that the dates, times, and locations for public meetings would be made known to the public
through the 



Federal Register



. The following public meetings have been scheduled to provide the public with an update on the federal analysis and
to review alternative transmission line corridors. The public meetings will begin at 7:00 pm and end at 9:00 p.m. at
the following locations:










July 12, 1994, New Castle High School, Route 615, New Castle, Virginia



July 13, 1994, Narrows High School, 115 Woodland Avenue, Narrows, Virginia



July 14, 1994, Union High School, School Street, Union, West Virginia



July 15, 1994, Waiteville Community Center, Ray Siding Road, Waiteville, West Virginia













FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:







Frank Bergmann, Forest Service Project Coordinator, Jefferson National Forest. The address and telephone number
are changed from 210 Franklin Road SW, Caller Service 2900, Roanoke, Virginia, 24001/(703) 982&hyph;4348 to 5162
Valleypointe Parkway, Roanoke, Virginia, 24019/(703) 265&hyph;6005.











SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



The Appalachian Power Company has submitted an application to the Jefferson National Forest for authorization to
construct a 765,000-volt electric transmission line across approximately twelve miles of the National Forest.
Portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River (at Bluestone Lake), and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage
Easement Land (at Guyandotte River) would also be crossed by the proposed transmission line.











Studies conducted by the Appalachian Power Company and submitted to the Virginia State Corporation Commission,
as part of its application and approval process, indicate a need to reinforce its extra high voltage transmission
system by the mid-to-late 1990s in order to maintain a reliable power supply for projected demands within its service
territory in central and western Virginia and southern West Virginia.



A study to evaluate potential route locations of the proposed transmission line has been prepared for Appalachian
Power Company through a contract with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) and West Virginia
University (WVU). The information gathered by VPI and WVU, along with other information collected during the analysis
process, will be utilized in the preparation of the environmental impact statement. General information about the
transmission line route proposal is available from the Jefferson National Forest.



The decisions to be made following the environmental analysis are whether the Forest Service, the National Park Service,
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will authorize Appalachian Power Company to cross the Jefferson National Forest,
the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, and the New River and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land, respectively,
with the proposed 765,000-volt transmission line and, if so, under what conditions a crossing would be authorized.



In preparing the environmental impact statement a range of routing alternatives will be considered to meet the purpose
and need for the proposed action. A no action alternative will also be analyzed. Under the no action alternative APCO
would not be authorized to cross the Jefferson National Forest, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River
or R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land. The alternatives developed by VPI and WVU will also be considered.



The federal analysis will include an analysis of the effects of the proposed transmission line along the entire proposed
route as well as all alternative routes which are considered in detail.



The significant issues identified for the federal analysis are listed below:

HARRY CAUDILL; INSPIRED WAR ON POVERTY 




From Associated Press 




WHITESBURG, Ky. 




Author Harry M. Caudill, whose book "Night Comes to the Cumberlands" helped 
inspire President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, shot himself to death 
Thursday in view of the mountains he loved so fiercely. He was 68. 


Caudill shot himself in the head, said Edison Banks Jr., the assistant 
commonwealth's attorney of Letcher County. 


Caudill was pronounced dead about 3 1/2 hours later at Whitesburg Appalachian 
Regional Hospital. 


"He did it in typical Harry style," said Banks, a former student of Caudill's. 
"He was looking at the mountains and shot himself once in the temple area." 


Pat Gish, a friend of Caudill's, said the writer had Parkinson's disease. "It 
was the result of a long struggle with poor health," said Gish, who publishes 
The Mountain Eagle newspaper in Whitesburg with her husband, Tom. 


A retired lawyer and state legislator, Caudill taught Appalachian history for 
eight years at the University of Kentucky until 1985. 


Caudill is best known for his 1963 book, "Night Comes to the Cumberlands," an 
expose of poverty in Appalachia. 


The book so vividly described Appalachia's problems that it brought the region 
into the national spotlight. President Johnson subsequently backed an array of 
social programs designed to develop the region and improve living standards for 
its people. 


Caudill vividly described environmental problems caused by strip mining, 
criticized absentee landowners and preached to improve the region's schools. He 
was widely admired for taking courageous stands against injustice despite huge 
obstacles and a hostile political climate. 


By last spring, Caudill had written 10 books, 80 essays and editorials and 
about 50 magazine articles protesting injustices faced by Appalachian 
residents.

BLIND HIKER GETS TO END OF TRAIL IN MAINE WOODS 




From Associated Press 




MILLINOCKET, Me. 




Blind hiker Bill Irwin today completed his Appalachian Trail journey that began 
eight months ago, making him the first blind person to hike the entire 2,167 
miles. 


About 60 people greeted him as he reached the end of the Georgia-to-Maine trail 
at Katahdin Stream campground this morning, an official in remote Baxter State 
Park said. 


Irwin was joined by about 20 friends and reporters for the final 2.4-mile leg 
of the journey, although he walked the last few hundred yards alone. 


Irwin completed his trek under sunny skies with temperatures in the upper 30s. 


In recent days, Irwin had hiked in snow and sleet, but today he got what 
Carolyn Starling, a close friend, called "prayed-to-order weather." 


Irwin, of Burlington, N.C., was accompanied by his guide dog Orient during the 
epic journey. 


Sponsors helped pay expenses for Irwin, a 50-year-old recovering alcoholic who 
lost his sight to an eye disease when he was 28. 


"I'm no great example of anything," he said in a recent interview. "Any blind 
person that is capable could do the same thing if they wanted to go through the 
same difficulty." 


Since setting out from Georgia in March, Irwin has fallen dozens of times. He 
has broken a rib, worn out equipment and coped with foul weather.

U.S. READY TO PLAY HARDBALL WITH HARDWOOD EXPORTS; 


EXPORTS: THE GROWING CAMPAIGN TO SELL HARDWOODS TO JAPAN AND EUROPE CAN TURN 
THE TIDE OF DEPRESSION IN APPALACHIA, ASSOCIATION OFFICIAL BELIEVES. 




From Associated Press 




MORGANTOWN, W.Va. 




When Robert Conner looks at a stand of red oak, black cherry or maple rooted in 
the hills of Appalachia, he sees dollars for a chronically depressed economy 
and a way to ease the nation's trade imbalance, especially with Japan. 


"If we can increase the export of hardwoods, it will automatically provide jobs 
and make up for some of those cars the Japanese have been sending over here," 
said Conner, executive director of the Appalachian Export Center for Hardwoods. 


"The Japanese like wood in just about everything. Once we figure out what they 
want and how to get it to them, we could be very big in the furniture and trim 
business," he said. 


The new export project was established last spring with a five-year federal 
grant of about $500,000 annually and a matching contribution from West Virginia 
University. 


The center, housed in a converted dormitory, is a joint venture of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research Service and the 
university's schools of agriculture and forestry, business and economics and 
extension service. 


The project's aim is to boost demand for Appalachian hardwood and products made 
from it, Conner said. 


"Internationally, there's a shortage," said Conner, a retired marketing 
professor. "The demand is very strong. Most producers here are selling it as 
fast as they cut it." 


Towering stands of black walnut, poplar and other hardwoods are plentiful in 
the Appalachian region, which includes West Virginia and parts of Alabama, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. 


One of the main problems has been harvesting the timber and finding buyers, 
Conner said. 


"The stories are legion throughout Appalachia about people cutting valuable 
trees and then using the wood to prop up roofs in coal mines," he said. 


"Now, we have the systems in place to let the grower and the mill owner know 
who wants what, at what price and how to get it there," Conner declared. 


The United States is a leading exporter of finished hardwood lumber and among 
the world's top 10 producers of hardwood logs, according to Al Goetzl, vice 
president of economics for the National Forest Products Assn., a trade 
organization representing the solid wood industry. 


Exports of hardwood logs, lumber, veneers and other products totaled about $1 
billion last year, U.S. Forest Service figures show. Red and white oak 
accounted for about two-thirds of the sales, with ash, hickory, maple and other 
species making up the balance. 


Japan is the largest importer of American hardwoods, followed by Canada, West 
Germany, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. 


Hardwood exports began to boom in the early 1980s, said William G. Luppold, an 
economist at the Forest Service's Forestry Sciences Laboratory in Princeton, 
N.J. 


"It's a relatively new thing," Luppold said. "We weren't exporting a whole lot 
in the 1950s or 1960s. We began to ship to Europe in the 1970s when the 
exchange rates improved." 


Dynamic growth didn't come until the 1980s, when exports to Taiwan, an expanded 
European market and Japan made the United States a major player in the world 
hardwood market. 


The sale of U.S. hardwood lumber to Japan totaled $19 million in 1983, 
Department of Commerce figures show. That amount had grown to $132 million by 
1988. 


"It looks as though it will be the same or higher this year," Luppold said. 


Nonetheless, the Japanese have been interested largely in raw lumber, which 
their own craftsmen can process into finished products. One of the Appalachian 
center's goals is to increase exports of furniture and veneers to Japan. 


"It's getting better," said Conner, who toured Japan last month with a group of 
furniture dealers seeking to break into the Japanese market. 


"The wage rate in Japan is so high that it doesn't pay to ship whole logs over 
there anymore," Conner said. "Now, they're beginning to order furniture parts 
that they'll assemble over there."

FOREST TRAILS 




In response to "Trail Maintenance Long Overdue," editorial, Oct. 12: 


The Forest Service has two interesting ways of dealing with poor trail 
maintenance, in addition to failing to insist on reallocation of funds from 
logging roads to trails. One is to allow a trail to get overgrown and drop it 
from maps in succeeding editions. An "antique" Forest Service map of the Los 
Angeles Padres Forest, the 1969 edition, shows a number of trails so treated. 
Trying to hike up the east side of Cobblestone Mountain is an example. 
Chaparral has obliterated the trail in enough places that it takes an expert in 
reading maps to make one's way. 


The second approach is to get groups to "adopt a trail," or at least to work on 
it, using Forest Service tools and some supervision. Although hikers have risen 
to the need, especially under the leadership of Ken Croker in the Cleveland 
National Forest, and Charlie Jones and John Robinson in the Angeles, there is 
an implicit guilt trip laid on hikers unmatched in other parts of the service's 
activities. We do not expect volunteers to cut down timber, although possibly 
that's next, since so much logging is subsidized by the Forest Service.

A LONG, WINDING ROAD THROUGH GREAT SMOKIES 




By ERIC SCHMITT, Schmitt is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of the New 
York Times. 




WALHALLA, S.C. 




At the top of Issaqueena Falls, a narrow path led to a misty nook behind the 
roaring cataract. We reached into the watery curtain with cupped hands, 
stealing a sip before the current cascaded over a dozen rocky ledges to a 
stream 200 feet below. 


Outside the alcove, the trail veered toward stands of hickory and long-leafed 
pine, clinging to the mountainside before dropping abruptly to follow the 
falls. 


I went first, picking my way carefully down the steep path that changed quickly 
from packed earth to slick, ochre-colored clay. 


Suddenly I slipped. Sliding out of control, I lunged for a sapling and grabbed 
it a few feet before disappearing into a small ravine. 


Scrambling to my feet, I skated the rest of the slippery descent. It was worth 
it. 


The falls cut through the sun-dappled forest like a jagged scar of stone 
pummeled by crashing water. It was difficult to hear anything over the din. 


Issaqueena Falls was a heart-stopping start to a weeklong journey that my wife 
and I took through the Great Smoky and southern Appalachian mountains. 


Using back roads, we made a 170-mile loop through western South Carolina and 
North Carolina. The loop took us through a village on the Appalachian Trail, a 
hamlet renowned for its mountain crafts and several other places that were 
ideal jumping-off points for day-trips to secluded waterfalls, hiking trails 
brimming with wildflowers and rivers for white-water rafting. 


Our route skirted the boundaries of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, until 
the end when we plunged into the popular federal reserve for two days of hikes. 


Atop an observation tower at Clingmans Dome, a 6,642-foot summit, we admired 
the famous haze that hangs over the ancient peaks. 


At Walhalla, a hamlet of 4,000 in South Carolina's northwest corner, our 
guidebooks said the town is named after Valhalla, the legendary garden paradise 
of the gods in Norse mythology. 


Walhalla's real beauty, a service station attendant in town told us, was five 
miles up the road at Issaqueena Falls, named for a mythical Indian maiden. 


An unobtrusive wooden sign on the right side of South Carolina 28, "Issaqueena 
Falls -- Stumphouse Mountain Tunnel," pointed us down a narrow, winding road to 
a picnic area and the top of the falls, where we started our precipitous hike. 


Having survived the treacherous path (vowing never to be caught wearing tennis 
shoes on a clay trail again), we followed the gas station attendant's second 
suggestion and walked up the paved road to the tunnel, a piece of the folklore 
in South Carolina's Up Country. 


The tunnel is a monument to a gallant but futile effort in the 1850s to burrow 
through a mile of granite. After six years of chipping and blasting, the Blue 
Ridge Railroad ran out of money for the project that was to link South Carolina 
to the Midwest. Despite revived attempts in 1876, 1900 and 1940, the tunnel 
remains unfinished but not abandoned. 


The tunnel's constant climate, 50 degrees and 90% humidity, was perfect for 
aging blue cheese. So for 15 years, until the mid-1950s, Clemson University 
aged its commercial brand of blue cheese in it. 


Inside the 1,600-foot tunnel, dripping water from the blasted-rock ceiling had 
carved out permanent puddles. The drops echoed in tinny pings off the cavernous 
walls. 


As we walked farther inside, the inky blackness sopped up light leaking from 
the entrance. Without a flashlight, we quit after our path dissolved into 
darkness. 


Back on the road, driving up miles of switchbacks, we understood why a tunnel 
through Stumphouse Mountain made sense. The scenery helped soothe our queasy 
stomaches as we passed dozens of flowering dogwoods, peach and apple orchards 
and an occasional pasture with horses basking in the sun. 


Crossing into North Carolina we entered Cullasaja River Gorge. Along the canyon 
on U.S. 64 are five waterfalls. Our favorite was Dry Falls, which was anything 
but. From the parking lot an easily traversed path curls behind the base of the 
120-foot falls. 


A friend recommended that we stay overnight in Dillsboro, N.C., a hamlet of 182 
people known for its artisans, about an hour west of Ashevile, N.C., and due 
north of Walhalla. 


Activity in the village revolves around about 50 weavers, silversmiths, 
potters, antique dealers, inns, restaurants and other merchants. Official 
business in Dillsboro is sparse: city hall is open from 8 a.m. to noon on 
Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 


Walking down Dillsboro's main thoroughfare, Haywood Street, an old-fashioned, 
red Texaco gasoline pump propped up outside Jones Country Store caught my 
attention. 


Inside the store we discovered a Depression-era time capsule. Antique toy race 
cars, surveying instruments, wooden tennis racquets in their presses, dishware, 
pots and pans and assorted knickknacks hung from hooks, bulged from shelves and 
beckoned from barrels and bins arranged on the worn hardwood floor. 


One of the few contemporary pieces in the store was its owner, Marion Jones, 
who greeted us from a rocking chair next to the pot-bellied stove where he was 
smoking a pipe and strumming a banjo. 


Jones, a 52-year-old former investigator for North Carolina's 30th Judicial 
District, regaled us with stories of cases he'd covered.. 


"Farmers around here are real nice people," Jones said in his soft mountain 
drawl. "But you steal from them and you're liable to get a britches full of 
lead." 


We steered clear of any gun-toting landowners, choosing instead to challenge 
the rapids on one of the region's many mountain rivers. 


One goal of our trip had been to canoe or raft some of the region's famous 
rivers. So from Dillsboro we backtracked 25 miles west along U.S. 19 to the 
Nantahala Outdoor Center, one of several companies in the area that lead guided 
river-rafting trips. 


Because workers were repairing the dam that controls the flow of the Nantahala 
River, our group of 15 people was shuttled by school bus to the nearby Little 
Tennessee River. 


After a briefing that included a stern warning to point our feet up in the 
water if we capsized (to avoid lodging a foot between rocks on the river bottom 
or hitting our heads on rocks), we set out in one- and two-person "ducks," 
10-foot, banana-shaped boats made of reinforced rubber that were better suited 
to navigate the river's rocky, narrow passages than larger rafts. 


Armed with double-bladed paddles, our chain of rafts snaked down the gorge. 
From the high-water mark on the banks we could tell that the river was down 
about three feet from its normal level, a stark reminder of the severe drought 
that has gripped much of the Southeast for as long as three years. 


Wildlife was abundant. A water snake slithered across our bow. A few minutes 
later an osprey angled across the sky. 


We floated lazily through calm waters for parts of the two-hour trip, but more 
often we zigzagged through minefields of rocks, many hidden except for a 
telltale riffle. 


My wife and I developed our own comic routine: Scream at each other to avoid 
the rocks, get stuck on the rocks, push off the rocks with our paddles, and get 
ready for the next assault. What a team. 


Our group finally pulled up on the river bank to survey the final run, a raging 
current coursing through a V-shaped narrows. "Just aim for the white water and 
you'll be fine," said our guide, speaking from years of experience to a group 
of nervous novices. 


My wife and I shoved off, snagged briefly on a rock, then shot through the 
churning white water to the cheers of our fellow rafters. We paddled into a 
calm pool, soaked and sitting in eight inches of water, but exhilarated. 


If we found the spirit of adventure on the Little Tennessee, we discovered the 
timeless soul of the Smokies at a small inn in Hot Springs, N.C., a strong 
recommendation from a friend who attended Duke University but sought solace in 
the Smokies. 


A 19th-Century tourist mecca whose mineral springs attracted thousands of 
visitors a year, Hot Springs is a sleepy village of 500 that straddles the 
border of North Carolina and Tennessee, 60 miles east of Knoxville. 


The hub of Hot Springs is Elmer Hall's rambling, two-story Victorian inn just 
off Main Street. 


For nearly a dozen years the inn has been a popular stop for 2,000 hikers a 
year off the Appalachian Trail, which runs down Main Street. It is also a haven 
for students, poets, artists, writers and anyone else seeking the tranquillity 
of the mountains. 


Hall, a bearded 51-year-old retired Methodist minister, describes the inn as 
"an alternative place for an alternative kind of people." Most guests we met 
were hiking the 2,100-mile trail, including a few college students, a computer 
programmer and a retired businessman. 


In the inn's common rooms, guests sink into overstuffed couches or rockers to 
swap stories from the trail or browse through bookshelves loaded with bird and 
wildflower guides, histories of the Appalachian Trail and books on Oriental 
philosophy. 


All meals are vegetarian and served family-style. Dinner one night was a 
delicious homemade vegetable soup, a huge tossed salad and whole-wheat pasta 
with pesto and fresh chopped tomatoes. 


From the inn there were several day-hikes that varied in length and difficulty. 
We chose a 10-miler along nearby Laurel Creek, and were rewarded with a 
creekside path fringed with wild geraniums, silverbells, trilliums, iris and 
sweet clover. 


Somehow we missed the cutoff back to the inn, and our three-hour nature walk 
turned into an adventure. With the French Broad River on our left, we followed 
the railroad tracks we knew took us back to town. Walking on railroad ties was 
boring but bearable, until we came to a bridge that spanned the river. 


We had a problem. The 400-foot-long railroad bridge had no pedestrian walk and 
nowhere to go if a train came, except the swiftly moving river 25 feet below. 


We stepped gingerly out onto the tracks. The trick was to avoid looking down at 
the river through the two-foot gaps in the ties (causing instant vertigo) or 
stepping on one of the rotting beams. 


We both took deep breaths. The wind whistled through the bridge girders in an 
eerie aria. We were supposed to head back to Greenville the next morning. Would 
we make it? We started out across the bridge. I walked. My wife crawled. No 
trains came. We made it back to the inn just in time for supper.

The best times of year to visit the Great Smoky Mountains are spring and fall. 
The fall foliage colors rival those of New England. 


Nowhere is the burst of wildflowers more exuberant than in the Smokies at 
springtime. Great Smoky Mountains National Park's annual wildflower pilgrimage, 
when blooms should be at their peak for photographers and nature lovers, is 
scheduled for April 26-28, 1990. 


Travelers to the Smokies can fly into Asheville, N.C., or Greenville, S.C., 
both of which are served by USAir, American and Delta Airlines. Rent a car and 
explore. 


From Asheville, a good route is to drive north on South Carolina 25 to Hot 
Springs. Follow 25 and then U.S. 321 to Gatlinburg, Tenn. Drive south through 
Walhalla and head east to Greenville and the airport there, or continue north 
back to Asheville on back roads or on Interstate 26. Arriving in Greenville, 
follow the route in reverse. 


Accommodations in the region: 


Highlands Inn, P.O. Box 1030, Highlands, N.C. 28741, (704) 526-9380. It's 25 
miles north of Walhalla. It has 16 rooms, $65 to $75, including breakfast. Open 
April through November. 


Squire Watkins Inn, P.O. Box 430, Dillsboro, N.C. 28725, (704) 586-5244. Five 
rooms, $60-$70. Open all year. 


Jarrett House, Haywood Street, Dillsboro, N.C. 28725, (704) 586-9964. 
Twenty-two rooms, $25-$34. Open mid-April through October. 


Smoky Shadows Lodge, Maggie Valley, N.C. 28751, (704) 926-0001. Twelve rooms, 
$45-$60, including breakfast. Open all year. 


Buckhorn Inn, Route 3, Gatlinburg, Tenn. 37738, (615) 436-4668. This one has 
six rooms plus four cottages: $75 for inn rooms, $95 for cottages, including 
breakfast. Open all year. 


The Inn at Hot Springs, P.O. Box 233, Hot Springs, N.C. 28743, (714) 622-7206. 
Seven rooms for $30. Breakfast is $3, dinner $8. All meals are vegetarian. Open 
all year. 


Great Smoky Mountains National Park draws more visitors annually than any other 
national park (about 8.7 million in 1988), so travelers to the area should make 
hotel reservations during peak spring and fall months.

ON THE BEATEN PATH; 


ARCHEOLOGIST FOLLOWS IN FOOTSTEPS OF DESERT INDIANS 




By CHARLES HILLINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




CHUCKWALLA VALLEY, Calif. 




Archeologist Mike Mitchell picked up charred bone fragments along the ancient 
Indian trail in this remote stretch of Riverside County desert. 


"These are deer or bighorn sheep bones more than likely barbecued and eaten by 
Indians a long, long time ago," mused Mitchell, 48, an archeologist with the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 


Mitchell was following what he described as a footpath, "perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 
years old," that snakes across the barren desert landscape. 


The trail was covered with desert varnish, a patina formed by a combination of 
the oxidation of iron and manganese interacting with a microorganism, lighter 
than the older coloration of the stones and rocks embracing it. 


It was one segment of a sophisticated network of ancient Indian trails 
preserved in this land of little rain and sizzling sun, undisturbed and seldom 
visited by man. 


Daniel McCarthy, 42, a UC Riverside archeologist and coordinator for the 
California Archeology Inventory, has been studying and cataloguing Indian 
trails in the deserts of Inyo, San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties 
in California and Yuma County in Arizona for the past 15 years. 


McCarthy has mapped 70 miles of the aborigine footpaths, the longest segment 
running 6 1/2 miles. The trails, he said, are remnants of hundreds of miles of 
prehistoric arteries of travel and trade crisscrossing the Southern California 
desert. 


"Indian trails are mentioned in the literature of the Old West, but no one has 
taken an inventory of the footpaths, recording evidence of people traveling 
over the same ground for centuries to get from one place to another," explained 
McCarthy, who has undertaken that task. 


There are more Indian trails remaining on the California and Arizona deserts 
than anywhere else in America because of the unique preservation qualities in 
this arid country, the archeologist noted. 


Some of the trails across the desert were still used by Colorado River Indians 
as recently as 75 years ago. McCarthy has been gathering information about the 
footpaths from the Indians. 


"Surprisingly, there are still Colorado River Indians alive who walked the 
trails with their parents and others when they were very young. They remember 
walking across the desert following the trails from one water source to another 
as their ancestors did. The trails have great sentimental meaning to them," 
McCarthy said. 


He said Indians would walk as far as 30 miles a day. They would stop over at 
springs where trees and plants flourished and game animals gathered. 


"They would eat mesquite and palm seeds, cactus fruit, feed on deer, bighorn 
sheep, rabbit and other animals," McCarthy said. 


Along the Indian trails are petroglyphs (rock carvings) and pictographs (rock 
paintings) of geometric designs, abstract images and human, animal, snake and 
insect figures. 


There also are rock alignments along the trails resembling humans and animals. 
And there are intaglios, large figures made by pushing aside rocks and stones 
covered with desert varnish to expose lighter soil. 


It is possible to get an idea of the age of the trails from the type of broken 
pottery and other artifacts found along the paths, noted McCarthy. 


"Many trails obviously have been eroded and washed away. Some have been damaged 
or destroyed by off-road vehicles. Until now there have been no attempts to 
save, protect and preserve the trails from modern man's incursions. Fortunately 
most of the trails are in relatively inaccessible areas," he said. 


"You cannot manage something unless you know what is out there. Most people on 
encountering the trails are unaware they are products of many feet traveling 
over the same ground for centuries. In some places the foot traffic was so 
heavy it wore the bedrock down to form a path." 


McCarthy is hoping that the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service 
administrators of the desert where the trails are found will someday set aside 
some of the segments and provide information and access to the public. 


"It is easy to use your imagination and envision Indians through the centuries 
tramping across the desert. The paths are . . . another clue to the 
understanding of prehistoric man's existence in Southern California," said 
McCarthy.

DEVELOPING A COUNTY STRATEGY TO PROTECT RECREATIONAL TRAILS 




There have been several excellent articles on the deterioration of the hiking, 
biking and riding trails, not only in Orange County but in the state and nation 
as a whole. Recreation for the public is taking a back seat to development and 
private economic expansion. The Forest Service has blamed inadequate funding 
and loss of experienced employees for the mounting problems. 


In Orange County, we have an excellent master plan for hiking, biking and 
riding trails that was adopted in 1965 and updated in 1982. The importance of 
the trail system is well documented; however, lack of funding and experienced 
personnel has resulted in a number of trails being incomplete and developers 
not being made aware of the location or the extent of trail development. 


The newly formed Orange County Recreational Trails Committee, a volunteer 
advisory board, hopes to identify all of the problem areas by working with 
county agencies and development companies. Through cooperative efforts and the 
interest of the public we may: implement the Master Plan of regional riding and 
hiking trails proposed by Orange County; provide useful and efficient public 
regional riding and hiking trail system; place an emphasis on trail linkage 
opportunities between community, county, and state open spaces and recreation 
facilities, and provide an environment for pleasant and safe outdoor 
recreational activities. 


The establishment of an official trails committee, by the county supervisors, 
to watch over the implementation of the recreational trails is essential. Once 
we lose these trails, allowing them to be built over, they are gone forever.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI VALLEY; 


COUNTY POSTPONES ACTION TO ALLOW DOGS ON 9-MILE TRAIL 




By THIA BELL 




The Ventura County Parks and Harbor Commission has postponed until Sept. 15 the 
issue of whether dogs should be allowed on the Ojai Valley Trail. 


The panel was to consider a county Parks Department recommendation that dogs be 
allowed if they are on a leash and their owners carry "pooper scoopers" to keep 
the popular, nine-mile bike and bridle pathway clean. 


In the interim, however, the County Board of Supervisors has adopted a new law 
that requires pet owners after Aug. 9 to carry a bag or device to remove their 
pet's droppings if they walk their animals on any county property or public 
school ground. 


Kathy Jenks, director of the county's Animal Regulation Department, said that 
she proposed the law primarily to control droppings at schools and beaches, but 
that it applies to county parks such as the Ojai Valley Trail. 


"Now the only issue left is whether dogs will be allowed in this park," Parks 
Manager Andy Oshita said. 


The trail that snakes through Ojai Valley along California 33 is the county's 
longest, narrowest park. 


It was funded largely by state money earmarked for highway bicycle lanes. 
County officials were able to use the funds to develop the trail, which runs 
along a former railroad line into Ojai. 


When the trail was completed last year, signs were posted to prohibit dogs and 
motorized vehicles. 


Area residents told the commission in June that they intended to keep walking 
their dogs along the trail as they had done for years before it was paved. 


Although some bicyclists have demanded that no dogs be allowed, the Parks 
Department has received dozens of phone calls and letters indicating 90% of the 
trail-users favor allowing dogs as long as they are on a leash, Oshita said.

ON THE RECORD: IT'S THE SEASON FOR 'APPALACHIAN SPRING' 




By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to The Times. 




The recording industry, which seldom fails to respect composers' major 
anniversaries, particularly those slighted in the concert hall, has been 
sparing indeed in its recognition of the 90th birthday of Aaron Copland, 
arguably the most important musician this country has produced. 


Three years ago, CBS started issuing on CD its splendid collection of 
composer-conducted performances of the 1970s, with the object of completing the 
re-release project in time for Copland's 90th birthday last month. 


Nothing of the sort has happened. Among the missing are the "Organ" Symphony 
and "Short" Symphony, the excerpts from "The Tender Land" (a more vital 
realization of this problematic work that the overly respectful complete 
recording recently released by Virgin Classics), the Piano Concerto and 
"Vitebsk," the latter two with the composer as keyboard soloist, and many other 
compositions vital to a rounded picture of their composer. 


Other companies have not proven hotbeds of activity either, with much 
duplication of available works or, simply, lack of interest. 


"Appalachian Spring" remains the recorded favorite, but these days in the 
original chamber version for 13 players, created for Martha Graham in 1944, 
rather than the composer's later concert suite for full orchestra. 


Three new chamber versions are on the market, but only one deserves the label 
"complete original version." It comes to us from a fine ensemble called the 
Atlantic Sinfonietta, which, according to the printed insert, "divides its 
activities chiefly between New York City and Massachusetts" (Koch 7019). 


Andrew Schenck conducts this lively, dancey and lyrical account of the 
still-rarely heard complete score, which presents material not included in the 
orchestral version -- six minutes of darkly dramatic music, adding an element 
of danger to what can at times sound just a bit too sweetly disingenuous. 


The Koch CD, recorded with appropriate intimacy and warmth, contains another 
"original, complete": the work its composer, Samuel Barber, called "Medea" and 
wrote for Martha Graham's ballet "Cave of the Heart." In this case, neither of 
the composer's two subsequent full-orchestra versions has made much more 
headway in the repertory than the small-ensemble original. 


One searches in vain here for the composer's characteristic, endearing lyrical 
goo. "Medea" is terse, arid stuff, with strong suggestions of Stravinsky's 
late-'30s and '40s neoclassicism. The juxtaposition with the contemporaneous, 
similarly scored "Appalachian Spring" makes sense, but it is also unfortunate. 


The New York-based St. Luke's Chamber Orchestra is not on its best behavior 
under Dennis Russell Davies' direction in a scrappy, perhaps hastily prepared 
chamber "Appalachian Spring" shorn of the aforementioned "dark" passages. 


The two other works included in this Copland program (Musicmasters 7055) are 
worthwhile rarities, well-executed by members of the St. Luke's orchestra: the 
poignant, under-appreciated 1961 Nonet for Strings and the Two Pieces for 
String Quartet, elegant souvenirs of the composer's membership in the 1920s 
Paris workshop of Nadia Boulanger. 


"Appalachian Spring" also figures in a Copland program by conductor William 
Boughton and his English Symphony Orchestra (Nimbus 5246). The edition employed 
(and rather stiffly played) is an unsatisfactory compromise, with strings added 
to the chamber scoring and the usual cuts enforced, giving us the best of 
neither world. 


The program further includes "Quiet City," its solos too brashly played and 
loudly recorded; a charmless reading of the Four Dance Episodes from "Rodeo," 
and a Nonet that sounds sleepy beside Musicmasters' intense account. 


A charming curiosity is the composer's idiomatic arrangement for solo piano of 
the usual "Rodeo" episodes, part of a CD devoted to Copland's keyboard music 
(Nimbus 5267). The pianist is Alan Marks, who may be remembered as an Affiliate 
Artist at the Los Angeles Music Center more than a decade ago. 


Marks brings a big technique and plenty of rhythmic kick to the dances, 
sensitive coloration to the rare and attractive "Four Piano Blues" (published 
in 1949 but with elements dating back to the '20s) and the requisite dexterity 
and frowning authority to the knuckle-busting Piano Variations of 1930. 


The value of Marks' transcriptions of Copland's "Old American Songs," however, 
eludes this listener. Voiceless and textless, the songs' pungent charm 
evaporates, leaving us with a set of slender parlor pieces. 


Copland completed his tremendous Third Symphony in 1946 but only during the 
past decade has it been programmed with anything resembling frequency. Its 
belated popularity has much to do with the passionate advocacy of the late 
Leonard Bernstein. 


While the lush, grandly rhetorical Bernstein/New York Philharmonic recording 
(Deutsche Grammophon 419170) is one no Copland fan is likely to be without, the 
Symphony lends itself to a variety of approaches, such as the more stark and 
orderly alternative offered by Leonard Slatkin and his splendid St. Louis 
Symphony (RCA Victor 60149). 


The coupling is the tough, compelling and seldom-heard "Music for a Great City" 
(New York), which Copland derived from his score for the 1961 film "Something 
Wild." Slatkin and the orchestra capture the work's ferocious rhythmic drive to 
perfection and RCA's recording, in both works, combines optimal clarity with 
roof-raising power.

TRAIL MEETING GOES BACK TO DRAWING BOARD IN SEARCH OF MAP 




By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




A scheduled decision by the Board of Supervisors on whether to create a 
countywide system of riding and hiking trails was detoured Tuesday when board 
members learned there was no adequate map of the existing system to guide them 
in deciding whether developers should be forced to complete the missing links. 


County staff presented several maps showing the potential trails system, which 
has been discussed by the county board since 1972, but supervisors rejected the 
diagrams as "wish lists" that fail to specify what trails now exist and how 
much land is needed to provide the missing links. 


About 30 speakers voiced opinions on whether the trails system is "just a 
public subsidy for rich horse owners" or "a precious resource that we could 
save for our grandchildren," only to be told by board members that there was 
not enough concrete evidence of the cost of acquiring and maintaining a 
regional trails system. 


Anti-trails advocate Barbara Hutchinson pronounced herself "thoroughly 
disgusted" with the lack of a map showing the dedicated trails in the county 
system. 


"Where is this map that you have been promising us?" asked Hutchinson, who 
heads a property rights group called Worried Homeowners, Organized and Angry, 
(WHOA). "How can you act on this matter when you don't even know where (the 
trails system) is going to go?" 


The board ordered the county staff to present a specific trail system map 
within 90 days and circulate a proposed county policy on acquiring a trails 
system to the dozens of local community planning groups for their comments. 
Supervisors also directed the chief administrative officer to convene a 
workshop for review of the county's regional trails policies by proponents and 
opponents of the trail dedication plan. 


A Fallbrook resident who espoused a plan for preserving open space in the 
county's rural areas shook his head in disgust at the supervisors' decision to 
delay action. "If we keep going at the rate we are going, the whole county is 
going to be paved over," he said.

GRAND OPENING OF ISLIP RIDGE TRAIL 




By JOHN McKINNEY 




Completion of a new trail is always a cause to celebrate. And that's just what 
the San Gabriel Mountains Trail Builders intend to do next Saturday at the 
grand opening of the group's Islip Ridge Trail. 


The trail provides a new route from the Crystal Lake Recreation Area in Angeles 
National Forest to the top of Mt. Islip. The Trail Builders, a volunteer group 
under the leadership of Charles Jones, worked thousands of hours to blaze, then 
build, the pathway. 


Trail connoisseurs will appreciate the look -- and feel -- of a hand-built 
trail. The moderate grade, well-engineered switchbacks, rock work and the way 
the path gently crosses the land are due to the skill and hard work of many 
dedicated volunteers. 


Mt. Islip (pronounced eye-slip) is not named, as you might guess, for a clumsy 
mountaineer, but for Canadian George Islip, who homesteaded in San Gabriel 
Canyon a century ago. 


The mountain is not one of the tallest San Gabriel Mountain peaks, but its 
relatively isolated position on the spine of the range makes it stand out. The 
summit offers the hiker fine views of the middle portion of the Angeles 
National Forest high country and the metropolis. 


Mt. Islip has long been a popular destination for hikers. The mountain was 
particularly popular with Occidental College students, who, in 1909, built a 
huge cairn (heap of boulders) dubbed the Occidental Monument atop the summit. 


The monument, which had the name Occidental on top, stood for about two decades 
until the Forest Service cleared the summit of Mt. Islip to make room for a 
fire lookout tower. Today, the monument and fire lookout are long gone, but the 
stone foundation of the fire lookout's living quarters still remains. 


The new trail to Mt. Islip climbs the forested shoulder of the mountain, and 
intersects a summit trail that leads to the peak. 


Directions to trailhead: From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Azusa, take the 
Highway 39/Azusa Avenue exit. Drive north on Highway 39 for 24 miles to the 
turnoff for the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. After a mile you'll reach the 
Forest Service entry station ($3 per vehicle). 


Continue another mile to the Crystal Lake Visitor Center, which is open on 
weekends from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., then a half-mile to a large dirt parking lot 
on your right and signed Windy Gap Trail on your left. 


(Next Saturday morning only, you'll be able to continue past the parking area 
another mile to Deer Flat Campground, where the trail dedication ceremony takes 
place.) 


The hike: Ascend moderately on Windy Gap Trail, which passes near a campground 
and heads into the cool of the forest. The trail crosses a Forest Service road 
leading to Deer Flat Campground, ascends some more and reaches the dirt South 
Mount Hawkins Truck Road. Cross the road and look left for the beginning of 
Islip Ridge Trail, which some of the Trail Builders like to call the Big 
Cienega Cut-off because it passes near Big Cienega Spring. 


Enjoy the pleasant trail as it ascends moderately, more or less west, through 
pine, spruce and cedar forest. A bit more than a mile from the top, Islip Ridge 
Trail turns sharply north into a more sparse alpine forest. 


The trail intersects the path coming from Windy Gap. Turn left and walk a short 
but steep distance to the top of 8,250-foot Mt. Islip. 


Dedication ceremonies for the new Islip Ridge Trail will be held next Saturday 
at Deer Flat Group Campground in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. Breakfast 
will be provided by REI outdoor gear and clothing store of San Dimas and the 
Big Santa Anita Historical Society. 


Breakfast will be from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., dedication ceremonies from 9:45 
to 10:15, with a 10:30 hike along Islip Ridge Trail to Mt. Islip. For breakfast 
reservations, call REI at (714) 592-2095.
